The EU’s leaders should also foster private investment in southern members’ tradable-goods sectors, thereby helping these economies rebuild their export base faster.	欧盟领导人也应当促进对南部成员国贸易产品部门的私人投资，​​从而加快这些国家重建出口基地的速度。
And they should put real money into initiatives to train unemployed youth and encourage them to become more mobile.	他们应当用真金白银资助相关计划，培训失业青年并鼓励他们自由流动。
Last but not least, European policymakers should examine how to limit excess saving in the eurozone and thus rein in upward pressure on the common currency’s exchange rate.	最后但同样重要的是，欧洲决策者应研究如何限制欧元区的过度储蓄，从而遏制共同货币汇率上涨的势头。
But if they do not agree on what to do, they should resist the temptation to paper over their differences.	可如果他们无法就怎么做达成共识，就应当抵制住掩盖分歧的诱惑。
On the political front, the discussion is about what the EU should aim to become, and the post-election temptation is to give only one answer: less.	政治领域探讨的内容是欧盟的未来目标，而后选举期的诱惑只有一个：削弱欧盟职责。
This would be an understandable mistake, but a mistake nevertheless.	虽然这一错误可以理解，但终究是个错误。
Citizens may be divided on the degree of integration that is ultimately desirable, but one concern that they share is that government, at whatever level, should deliver.	民众对最终的一体化程度或有分歧，但他们都担心各级政府能否履行承诺。
That includes the EU, especially with respect to the euro.	这当中也包括欧盟，尤其是在欧元问题上。
Indeed, according to a recent opinion poll, three-quarters of the French public doubt that the euro was an initiative worth launching.	事实上，最近一项民调显示，四分之三的法国公众质疑欧元是否值得推出。
But exactly the same proportion opposes leaving the common currency.	但相同比例的民众却对退出共同货币持反对态度。
The message to EU institutions is clear: It may have been a mistake to give you this task, but the decision was made, so your role now is to make the euro work.	对欧盟机构发出的信息非常明确：把这项任务交给你们可能是个错误，但既然已经决定，让欧元持续下去就是你们的任务。
In other words, Europe’s citizens will certainly not endorse plans to broaden the scope of EU policies and authority; but, by the same token, they are well aware of the need for an EU that delivers on the obligations that it does have.	换言之，欧洲民众肯定不会同意扩大欧盟政策和授权范围的计划；但出于同样原因，他们非常清楚需要欧盟承担起它现在承担的职责。
Shortly before his death, Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, a former ECB board member and Italian finance minister, put the matter clearly.	去世前不久，前欧洲央行董事兼意大利财政部长派多亚夏欧帕明确阐述了这一问题。
Limited power, he said, is often confused with weak power, which lacks the tools needed to act within its sphere of authority.	他说限制权力往往被与权力薄弱混为一谈，后者往往缺乏职权范围内采取行动所需要的工具。
But it is the sphere of authority that should be limited, not the power to act within those limits.	但应当受到限制是权力范围，而不是在权力范围内采取行动。
Europe’s leaders should adopt that maxim as their motto: This is not the time for more Europe; it is a time for a Europe that fulfills its mandate.	欧洲领导人应该以此为座右铭：现在不是扩大欧洲的时机；但并不等于欧洲不该完成自己的任务。
That may imply stripping out unnecessary tasks for which the EU either lacks legitimacy or is not well equipped.	这或许意味着放弃欧盟缺乏合法授权或相应手段的不必要任务。
It may also mean giving the EU the power needed to succeed at what it is already in charge of doing.	这也可能意味着赋予欧盟权力完成它已经负责的任务。
This pragmatic agenda may look unexciting.	这样务实的已成也许看似平淡无奇。
It probably is.	或许的确是这样。
But it also probably offers the best chance to reconcile Europe’s people with the EU.	但这也可能是最佳时机在欧洲民众与欧盟之间进行调和。
	
The New Growth Conundrum	新增长难题
PARIS – For most governments, the rate of economic growth that can reasonably be expected in the coming years is a key question.	巴黎—对大部分政府来说，未来几年合理预期的经济增长率是一个大问题。
And, at least for the advanced economies, it has become a particularly puzzling one.	至少对于发达经济体来说，这是一个特别邻人困惑的问题。
If the past is a good predictor of the future, the outlook is bleak.	如果历史可以作为未来的好指标，那么可以说前景堪忧。
Since 2008, economic growth has consistently disappointed expectations.	2008年以来，经济增长一直无法达到预期。
Of the countries most affected by the financial crisis, only a few – the United States, Germany, and Sweden – have rediscovered the path to sustained growth.	在受金融危机影响最大的国家中，只有少数几个 — — 美国、德国和瑞典 — — 重新回到了持续复苏之路。
Yet, even for them, GDP in 2013 was far below the level projected prior to the crisis.	但是，即使是这些国家，2013年GDP也远低于危机前的趋势水平。
The consensus view among economists and policymakers is that the financial crisis and the euro crisis have damaged both demand and supply, but that a gradual healing process has begun.	经济学家和决策者的一致观点是，金融危机和欧元危机同时破坏了需求和供给，但缓慢的回暖过程已经开始。
On the demand side, according to this view, the hangover from pre-crisis private indebtedness and crisis-generated public indebtedness still weighs on domestic demand.	根据这一观点，在需求端，危机前的私人债务积压和危机造成的公共债务仍然抑制着内需。
This is likely to persist for several more years, though the burden will diminish steadily.	这一状况可能还会持续几年，尽管这一负担在稳步减轻。
Gradually, consumers will start spending and investing again (as is becoming the case in the US), and fiscal policy will become neutral again (as is already the case in Germany).	消费者将逐渐重新开始花钱和投资（美国正在向这个方向靠拢 ） ， 财政政策将重新回归中性（德国已经如此 ） 。
On the supply side, the crisis has lowered potential output growth, because, in Europe at least, firms have invested less, impeding the adoption of new technologies.	在供给端，危机降低了潜在产出增长，这是因为，至少在欧洲，企业投资得更少了，这阻碍了新技术的采用。
Moreover, in some cases – for example, the United Kingdom – wage decreases and flexible layoff rules have encouraged firms to substitute labor for capital, reducing output per employee.	此外，在一些国家 — — 比如英国 — — 工资下降和弹性劳动法规鼓励企业用劳动力代替资本，从而降低了员工人均产出。
Clogged capital markets and resistance to social hardship have also delayed the replacement of incumbent firms by more efficient new entrants.	资本市场运行不畅和对苦日子的反对也阻碍了现有企业被效率更高的新晋企业取代的步伐。
The aggregate result has been lower-than-anticipated productivity: in the UK, more person-hours were needed to produce a unit of output in 2013 than in 2007.	总的结果是生产率低于预期：在英国，2013年生产一单位产出所需工时比2007年更多。
Here, too, the supply-side effect of the crisis is likely to persist until firms invest in new equipment, innovation accelerates, and the churning process in labor markets resumes.	在这方面，危机的供给端效应也可能会一直持续到企业开始投资新设备、创新开始加速、劳动力市场新陈代谢开始重启为止。
But the view that advanced economies are gradually healing is challenged from both sides.	但发达经济体正在逐渐回暖的观点受到了供需两方面的挑战。
Starting with demand, Larry Summers, the Harvard economist and senior US official under Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, recently proposed that advanced economies have found themselves in the grip of secular stagnation.	从需求端开始。 哈佛大学经济学家、克林顿和奥巴马政府高官拉里·萨默斯（Larry Summers）最近指出，发达经济体正陷入长期停滞。
Summers’s view is that pre-crisis indebtedness was not an exogenous anomaly; it was the consequence of insufficient global demand.	萨默斯的观点是，危机前债务并不是外生反常现象，而是全球需求不足的结果。
The global distribution of income had shifted away from the advanced countries’ middle class toward the rich and the emerging economies, resulting in excess worldwide savings.	全球收入分配正在从发达国家中产阶级向富人和新兴经济体倾斜，导致全球储蓄过剩。
The only way to avoid stagnation was to push the middle class deeper into debt, helped by low interest rates and lenient lending rules.	避免停滞的唯一办法是让中产阶级进一步负债，而手段就是低利率和宽松的贷款规则。
In other words, the savings glut (as former US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke called it) predated the crisis and could continue to affect global demand, unless the emerging countries’ middle class provides the global economy with a new consumer of last resort.	换句话说，储蓄过剩（前美联储主席伯南克语）先于危机发生并可能继续影响全球需求，除非新兴国家中产阶级能够充当全球经济的新的最后消费者。
This is likely to happen eventually; but, despite efforts by the US and the International Monetary Fund in the context of the G-20, this rebalancing process has not yet been completed.	或许这最终会发生，但是，尽管美国和国际货币基金组织（IMF）在G-20框架下做出了大量努力，但这一再平衡过程仍未结束。
The challenge on the supply side stems from a new dispute among economists and technology experts about the pace of technological progress.	供给端的挑战来自经济学家和技术专家关于技术进步速度的新争论。
For Robert Gordon of Northwestern University, information and communication technologies have already delivered most of the productivity boost that can be expected from them; there is no major innovation wave in sight that could offset the slowdown in potential growth.	西北大学的罗伯特·戈登（Robert Gordon）指出，信息和通信技术已经贡献了绝大部分可以期待的生产率提升效应；放眼未来，已不再能够看到可以抵消潜在增长放缓的较大的创新潮。
Laggards can look forward to reaping catch-up dividends; but countries at the technology frontier should accept that very slow annual per capita growth – little more than 1% – is the new normal.	落后者可以着眼于收获赶超红利；但身处技术前沿的国家应该接受缓慢的人均年增长 — — 可能不到1 % — —成为新常态。
By contrast, the MIT scholars Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee argue that the Second Machine Age is yet to come.	相反，MIT学者埃里克·布莱恩约尔弗森（Erik Brynjolfsson）和安德鲁·麦克菲（Andrew McAfee）指出，第二机器时代（Second Machine Age）还没有到来。
They claim that ever-increasing computing power, worldwide connectivity, and the almost unlimited potential for generating new innovations through recombining existing processes will trigger major transformations in both production and consumption, in the same way that the steam engine transformed the world in the nineteenth century.	他们认为，不断增长的计算能力、全球互联以及几乎无穷无尽的通过重组现有过程产生新创新的潜力将给生产和消费带来重大变化，一如蒸汽机在十九世纪改变世界。
Growth should accelerate as a consequence, at least if properly measured.	增长也应该因此加速 — — 至少在测量得当的情况下是如此。
Combining the challenges cited by Gordon and Summers to the view that advanced economies are gradually healing leads to some depressing conclusions.	将戈登和萨默斯提出的挑战与发达经济体正在回暖的观点相结合，推出的结论令人沮丧。
If Gordon is right about slow productivity growth, the debt overhang inherited from the crisis and public-finance woes will persist for much longer than anticipated.	如果戈登关于生产率增长缓慢的看法是对的，那么危机和公共财政混乱导致的债务积压的持续时间将远大于预期。
If, in addition, Summers is right that demand is bound to remain deficient, the combination of financial troubles and persistent mass unemployment is likely to push governments toward radical solutions – debt default, inflation, or financial protectionism.	此外，如果萨默斯关于需求必定将维持不足状态的观点是对的，那么金融困境和持续大规模失业的组合可能导致政府采取激进方案 — — 债务违约、通货膨胀或金融保护主义。
If, on the contrary, Brynjolfsson and McAfee are right, growth will be much more robust, and debt issues will be forgotten sooner than expected.	相反，如果布莱恩约尔弗森和麦克菲是对的，增长将会十分强健，那么债务问题将比预期更早被人遗忘。
The challenge, instead, will be to cope with the labor-reducing and income-inequality effects of emerging technologies.	而挑战也将是如何应对新兴技术带来的劳动力需求减少和收入不平等的效应。
That will be especially true if these transformations take place against the background drawn by Summers of persistent mass unemployment.	如果这些变化在萨默斯关于持续大规模失业的观点的背景下发生，则上述两种效应会更加明显。
The risk is that social problems become intractable, as technological advances come to be regarded as benefiting the rich while creating additional hardship for the masses.	风险在于社会问题可能变得不可收拾，人们会认为技术进步肥了富人，而给大众造成了新的生活困难。
In such a scenario, governments will have to look for innovative responses.	在这样的情况下，政府将需要拿出创新性应对措施。
Scenarios like these may seem far-fetched.	这样的情景好像有些牵强。
But, while certainly discomfiting, they are hardly irrelevant.	但是，尽管它们说出来令人不快，却绝非杞人忧天。
	
The Conscience of a Conservative?	保守者的良心？
CAMBRIDGE – In a recent speech that received much attention in the United States and abroad, US Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican from Arizona, announced that he would not seek reelection.	剑桥 — — 在美国和海外近期引发高度关注的一次演讲中，来自亚利桑那州的共和党参议员杰夫·弗莱克（Jeff Flake）宣布将不会寻求连任。
To agree with the reasoning Flake offered in defense of his decision, one must believe that a US senator’s highest duty is to speak truth to power, repudiate the president for “reckless, outrageous, and undignified behavior” that is “undermining our democracy,” and then quit.	如果你同意弗莱克为弃选决定辩护的理由，那么你一定认为一位美国参议员的最高职责是向当权者讲真话，批判总统“破坏国内民主”的“鲁莽、粗暴和不体面的行为 ” 。
Many mainstream media outlets apparently believe just that, lavishing praise on Flake’s impassioned jeremiad.	许多主流媒体显然都相信这就是事实，不遗余力地赞扬弗莱克充满激情的壮举。
According to a CNN political analyst, it was “the most important political speech of 2017 – and one of the most powerful political speeches in the modern era of the Senate.”	据CNN政治分析人士透露，弗莱克的演讲是“2017年最重要的政治演讲 — — 也是现代参议院最强有力的政治演讲之一 。 ”
Both The New York Times and The Washington Post featured the speech prominently in front-page stories.	纽约时报和华盛顿邮报都在头版头条为此刊发了特写。
But if we take Flake at his word that he is acting on principle, we must ask: what principle?	但如果我们相信弗莱克坚持原则的说法，我们必须问问自己 ： “ 他坚持的是什么原则？
If Flake is right that democracy itself is in peril unless we all “stand up and speak out,” then what good does it do to throw in the towel?	如果弗莱克有关我们必须“站出来大声疾呼 ” ， 否则民主本身就会受到威胁的说法是正确的，那么现在扔毛巾又会带来什么好处？
In his speech, Flake began by pointing out that President Donald Trump’s words and actions are consistently beyond the pale, bringing disgrace to the office of the presidency.	在演讲中，弗莱克一开始就指出唐纳德·特朗普总统的言行根本无法接受，令总统办公室为此蒙受耻辱。
But Trump’s coarse behavior isn’t news to anyone who has been paying attention.	但特朗普的粗鲁行为对所有关注情况的人早已不是什么新闻了。
Flake then announced that he would “no longer be complicit or silent.”	弗莱克随后宣布他将“不再串通一气或保持沉默 。 ”
We can certainly applaud him for that, but then we should ask what took him so long.	我们当然可以为此送上掌声，但之后我们应当问问他为什么等了这么长时间才做出这样的决策？
All Americans have a right – indeed, a duty – to speak out against threats to their country.	所有美国人都有权 — — 实际上是有责任 — — 不对威胁国家的行为保持沉默。
But a senator is more than just another citizen.	但参议员并不仅仅是普通公民。
Flake is one of 100 members of America’s highest legislative body.	弗莱克是美国最高立法机构百名成员中的一份子。
He shares with his fellow senators the power to vote yes or no on proposals made by the president.	他和参议员同僚们共同享有赞成或否决总统提案的权力。
He can draft and help shape legislation that he believes to be in the public interest.	他可以起草和协助制定他认为符合公共利益的立法。
And if at some point the US House of Representatives brings impeachment charges against Trump, he would be one of 100 judges presiding over that fateful case.	如果美国众议院在某个时点对特朗普提出弹劾指控，他将成为主持这一重大事件的百名法官之一。
It is understandable that a senator who regards a sitting president as a serious threat to the Republic would sound the alarm.	可以理解一位认为现任总统严重威胁共和国安全的参议员会拉响警报。
But for that senator simultaneously to announce that he is quitting makes no sense at all, especially given a senator’s unique power to act as well as to talk.	但如果这位参议员同时宣布他放弃竞选却根本不合逻辑，尤其考虑到参议员拥有发言和行动的独特权力。
Flake’s dire warning suggests that he should stay, not run away.	弗莱克恐怖的警告表明他应当留下而不是退缩。
Of course, Flake’s unstated reason for choosing flight over fight is hiding in plain view.	当然，弗莱克选择逃跑而不是战斗的潜在原因其实并不难看到。
Polls showed that he would have had a tough time getting reelected in 2018.	民调结果显示他在2018年寻求连任将会是一场艰苦的战斗。
Having been targeted first by Trump, and then by former White House Chief Strategist and current Breitbart News Executive Chairman Steve Bannon, Flake might not even have defeated a Republican primary challenger.	在被特朗普和前白宫首席战略家及现任布莱巴特新闻网执行主席史蒂夫·班农一再攻击后，弗莱克可能甚至无法击败一名共和党的初选挑战者。
Granted, no one is obliged to submit himself to the slings and arrows of electoral politics.	的确，没有人有义务承受选举政治的厄运和灾难。
And no one can be blamed for not wanting to participate in the poisonous politics of Washington today.	也没有人应当为不愿参与现在华盛顿的有毒政治而遭受指责。
As a citizen, I thank Flake for his service in Congress.	作为一名普通公民，我感谢弗莱克在国会期间所提供的服务。
But if he wants us to believe that his speech and decision to resign are in the service of the country, and based on principle, then he needs to explain what that principle is.	但如果他希望我们相信其演讲和辞职决定为的是坚持原则和捍卫国家利益，那么他需要向我们说明这个原则究竟是什么。
According to Immanuel Kant’s categorical imperative, principled action is that action which, if emulated by all others, would create a world in which we all want to live.	按照伊曼纽尔·康德的绝对律令，符合原则的行为如果被其他人所模仿，将会创造一个我们都愿意在其中生活的世界。
Does Flake want to live in a world in which all lawmakers who disagree with Trump have already stood up, spoken out vigorously, and left office?	弗莱克是否希望生活在一个所有与特朗普持不同意见的立法者都站出来大声疾呼，而后放弃公职的世界？
It isn’t clear whether Flake is calling for a boycott of electoral politics, or merely warning others not to run in races they might not win.	我们不清楚弗莱克是在呼吁所有人抵制选举政治，抑或仅仅是警告其他人不要参与可能无法获胜的竞争。
Either way, somebody will replace Flake in the Senate.	无论是哪一种，都会有人取代弗莱克的参议院席位。
So, it is worth asking if he thinks his successor will be better suited than he is to carry out the critically important duties of public service.	因此，我们应当探究他是否认为他的继任者履行公共服务的重要职责会比他更为适合？
In his 2017 book, Conscience of a Conservative, Flake boldly asserts that “we have become so estranged from our principles that we no longer know what principle is.”	在2017年著作保守者的良心中，弗莱克曾大胆断言“我们已经疏远了本来的原则，以至于我们已经不晓得什么是原则了 。 ”
Should this now be read as an unwitting confession that he has lost his own moral bearings?	这是否现在应当被视为其下意识的内心独白，承认自己已经失去了道德原则？
In his speech, Flake cited the Republican president Theodore Roosevelt as the model of “conscience and principle” to which he aspires.	在演讲中，弗莱克将共和党总统西奥多·罗斯福视为他心目中“良知和原则”的典范。
But those who have read Roosevelt know that he would not have walked away from today’s fight.	但那些了解罗斯福的人应当知道他不会逃离今天的战斗。
“It is not the critic who counts,” Roosevelt said in the speech “Citizenship in a Republic,” which he delivered at the Sorbonne in Paris in April 1910.	“重要的不是批评能否成功 ， ” 罗斯福在名为共和国公民的一次演讲中说，这次演讲是1910年4月他在巴黎的索邦大学发表的。
“The credit belongs to the man in the arena,” Roosevelt continued, “who spends himself in a worthy cause, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”	“荣誉归属于参与竞技的人 ， ” 罗斯福还说 ， “ 因为献身于有价值的事业，而且就算事情糟糕到极点，如果最终失败，至少他在失败前曾经勇敢尝试过，这样他就永远不会和那些不敢经历成败的胆小冷漠的灵魂为伍 。 ”
Now, that is a principle upon which the United States, and any republic, should stand.	现在，这恰恰就是美国以及任何共和国应当遵守的原则。
	
The Price of Scottish Independence	苏格兰独立的代价
NEW YORK – Though the world’s eyes now are on Scotland’s referendum on independence from the United Kingdom, Scotland is not alone in seeking to redraw national boundaries.	纽约—全世界的目光都集中在苏格兰脱离英国的公投上，但寻求重划国家边界的并不只有苏格兰。
There are independence movements in many other parts of the world; indeed, 39 new states have joined the United Nations since 1980.	世界其他许多地方都在进行独立运动；事实上，自1980年以来，有39个新国家加入了联合国。
Many more aspirants are waiting in the wings, and would likely be encouraged by a Scottish “Yes” vote.	更有许多野心家时刻准备着，如果苏格兰对独立说“是 ” ， 他们有可能大受鼓舞。
The Scottish pro-independence campaign is based on four claims.	苏格兰亲独立阵营有四个立足点。
The first is cultural: to protect and strengthen the identity of the Scottish people.	第一是文化：保护和强化苏格兰民族身份。
The second is ideological: to move Scotland toward a Scandinavian-style social democracy.	第二是意识形态：让苏格兰向斯堪的纳维亚式社会民主靠拢。
The third is political: to bring democratic governance closer to the people.	第三是政治：让人们更接近民主治理。
And the fourth is economic: to lay claim to a larger share of North Sea oil and gas.	第四是经济：获得北海石油和天然气的更大比例。
UK political leaders and many European governments are strongly urging the Scots to vote against independence.	英国政治领导人和许多欧洲国家政府强烈敦促苏格兰人反对独立。
Scottish independence, the “No” campaign argues, would bring few if any of the claimed benefits; on the contrary, it would cause many economic calamities, ranging from financial panics to the flight of jobs and industry from Scotland.	“不”阵营指出，苏格兰的独立有百害而无一利；会带来从金融恐慌到就业和产业逃离苏格兰在内的诸多经济灾难。
Moreover, an independent Scotland might be excluded from the European Union and NATO.	此外，独立的苏格兰可能被排除在欧盟和北约之外。
What should the rest of the world think about this debate?	世界其他国家应该如何看待这场争论？
Should the Scottish independence campaign be hailed as a breakthrough for claims to cultural identity and self-governance?	苏格兰独立运动应该被称为是文化身份和自治权利主张的突破吗？
Or should it be viewed as yet another source of instability and weakness in Europe – one that would increase uncertainty in other countries and parts of the world?	或者，它应该被视为欧洲动荡和软弱的又一源泉 — — 会增加其他国家和世界其他地区的不确定性吗？
Secession movements can, no doubt, cause great instability.	毫无疑问，分裂运动可能造成重大动荡。
Consider the regional and even global turmoil over Kosovo, South Sudan, Kurdistan, and Crimea.	科索沃、南苏丹、库尔德斯坦和克里米亚等地区甚至全球动荡就是明证。
Yet national independence can also be handled peacefully and smoothly.	但国家独立也可以和平而平稳地进行。
The 1993 division of Czechoslovakia into the Czech Republic and Slovakia – the famed “velvet divorce” – imposed no significant or lasting costs on either successor state.	1993年捷克斯洛伐克分裂为捷克共和国和斯洛伐克 — — 著名的“天鹅绒离婚 ” （ velvet divorce ） — —对两个后续国家都没有产生重大或持续的成本。
Both accepted the division, and, knowing that their future lay within the EU, focused their attention on accession.	两国都接受分离，并且明白它们的未来在于欧盟，因此将精力集中在入盟事宜。
Here, then, is a plausible and positive scenario for an independent Scotland.	于是，这也成了苏格兰独立的一个貌似可信的积极前景。
The rest of the UK (called the “RUK” in the current debate), including England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, would quickly and efficiently negotiate the terms of independence with Scotland, agreeing how to share the UK’s public debt and public assets, including offshore oil and gas. Both sides would be pragmatic and moderate in their demands.	英国的其余部分（在目前的争论中被称为“剩下的英国 ” ） 将包括英格兰、威尔士和北爱尔兰，会迅速、高效地与苏格兰进行独立条件谈判，就如何分担英国公共债务和公共资产（包括离岸石油和天然气）达成一致。
At the same time, the EU would agree immediately to Scotland’s continued membership, given that Scotland already abides by all of the required laws and democratic standards.	与此同时，欧盟将立刻同意保留苏格兰的成员国地位，因为苏格兰已经符合所有所需法律和民主标准。
Similarly, NATO would agree immediately to keep Scotland in the Alliance (though the Scottish National Party’s pledge to close US and British nuclear-submarine bases would be a complication to be overcome).	类似地，北约也将立刻同意苏格兰留在联盟内（尽管苏格兰国民党（Sottish National Party）声称要关闭美国和英国核潜艇基地，这是一个需要克服的发杂因素 ） 。
Both Scotland and the RUK might agree that Scotland would temporarily keep the British pound but would move to a new Scottish pound or the euro.	苏格兰和剩下的英国可能会同意苏格兰暂时使用英镑，但随后必须采用新的苏格兰镑或欧元。
If such monetary arrangements are transparent and cooperatively drawn, they could occur smoothly and without financial turmoil.	如果此类货币安排能做到透明与合作，就可以平稳过渡而不引起金融动荡。
But if the RUK, the EU, and NATO respond vindictively to a Yes vote – whether to teach Scotland a lesson or to deter others (such as Catalonia) – matters could become very ugly and very costly.	但如果剩下的英国、欧盟和北约对“是”的公投结果持敌意态度 — — 不管是为了给苏格兰一个教训还是为了阻止其他分裂运动（如加泰罗尼亚 ） — —情况就会相当糟糕，代价也会相当沉重。
Suppose that a newly independent Scotland is thrown out of the EU and NATO, and told that it will remain outside for years to come.	假设新独立的苏格兰被逐出欧盟和北约，并被告知未来多年内都没有加入的希望。
In this scenario, a financial panic could indeed be provoked, and both Scotland and the RUK would suffer economically.	在这一情形下，金融恐慌可能切实发生，苏格兰和剩下的英国都将遭受经济打击。
The key point is that the costs of separation are a matter of choice, not of inevitability.	关键点在于，分裂的成本是一个选择问题，而不是不可避免的。
They would depend mainly on how the RUK, the EU, and NATO decided to respond to a Yes vote, and how moderate a newly independent Scotland would be in its negotiating positions.	它们取决于剩下的英国、欧盟和北约决定如何应对“是”的结果，以及新独立的苏格兰在谈判中的立场有多温和。
If cool heads prevail, Scottish independence could proceed at a relatively low cost.	如果头脑保持冷静，苏格兰独立过程的代价可以相对较低。
The dangers of national secession are much greater in places without overarching entities like the EU and NATO to constrain the situation among the successor states.	国家分裂的危险在没有欧盟和北约等支配实体约束各后续国家局面的情况下会大大增加。
In such circumstances, unilateral claims of independence opposed by the national government or a sub-national unit often lead to a breakdown of trade and finance – and often to outright war, as we saw in the breakup of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and most recently, Sudan.	在这样的环境中，被国家政府或亚国家单元反对的单方面宣布独立常常会导致贸易和金融决裂 — — 还常常导致大战，苏联、南斯拉夫以及最近的苏丹解体都是明证。
In those cases, separation was indeed followed by deep economic and political crises, which in some ways persist.	在这些情形中，分裂事实上是随着以某种方式持久维持的深度经济和政治危机而发生的。
Indeed, in the case of ex-Yugoslavia and the former Soviet Union, the EU and NATO absorbed some but not all of the successor states, thereby raising major geopolitical tensions.	事实上，在前南斯拉夫和前苏联的例子中，欧盟和北约吸收了其中一些（而非全部）后续国家，从而引起了严重的地缘政治冲突。
International politics in the twenty-first century can no longer be about nation-states alone.	二十一世纪国际政治可能不再只是民族国家的政治。
Most key issues that are vital for national wellbeing – trade, finance, the rule of law, security, and the physical environment – depend at least as much on the presence of effective regional and global institutions.	大部分决定国民福利的关键问题 — — 贸易、金融、法治精神、安全和环境 — — 至少在很大程度上取决于高效的地区和全球机构的存在。
Even if Scotland declares independence, it will – and should continue to be – bound by a dense web of European and global rules and responsibilities.	即使苏格兰宣布独立，它也会并且应该继续受到欧洲和全球规则和责任的恢恢之网的约束。
I am personally sympathetic to Scotland’s independence as a way to bolster Scottish democracy and cultural identity.	我个人对苏格兰以独立作为刺激苏格兰民主和文化身份的方式持同情态度。
Yet I support independence only on the assumption that Scotland and the RUK would remain part of a strong and effective EU and NATO.	但我只支持基于以下条件的独立：苏格兰和剩下的英国仍然是强大且高效的欧盟和北约的一部分。
Certainly, a Yes vote would put an even higher premium on effective EU governance.	毫无疑问 ， “ 是”的结果将给高效欧盟治理带来更高的溢价。
But, if the EU and NATO were to “punish” a newly independent Scotland by excluding it, real disaster could ensue, not only for Scotland and the UK, but also for European democracy and security.	但是，如果欧盟和北约要通过排斥它来“惩罚”新独立的苏格兰，真正的灾难就会随之而来，不仅对苏格兰和英国是如此，对欧洲的民主和安全也是如此。
	
Cities and Sustainable Development	城市与可持续发展
NEW YORK – Tacloban in the Philippines has now joined the growing list of cities – including New Orleans, Bangkok, Moscow, New York, Beijing, Rio de Janeiro, and Port-au-Prince, to name just a few – pummeled in recent years by climate catastrophes.	纽约—菲律宾的塔克洛班（Tacloban）成为近几年来因气候灾难而被毁的城市名单上的新名字。 这一名单包括新奥尔良、曼谷、莫斯科、纽约、北京、里约热内卢、太子港 … … 等等。
Many of the world’s largest cities, built on seacoasts and rivers, face the threat of rising sea levels and intensifying storms.	许多临河和临海的世界上大城市面临着海平面上升的威胁和越来越严重的风暴。
So the new global development agenda now taking shape should empower cities to help lead the way to sustainable development in the twenty-first century.	因此，正在确定中的全球发展新日程必须赋予城市力量，让它们成为二十一世纪可持续发展的领导者。
The importance of cities in today’s world economy is unprecedented.	如今，城市对世界经济的重要性前所未有。
Until the Industrial Revolution, human history was overwhelmingly rural.	在工业革命前，人类历史可以说是一部农业史。
Only around 10% of people lived in cities.	只有大约10%的人类生活在城市中。
Today, the share of urbanites is around 53% and is likely to rise to around 67% by 2050.	如今，这一比例为53%左右，并有望在2050年升至67%左右。
Because per capita incomes are higher in cities than in rural areas, the world’s cities today are estimated to account for more than 80% of global income, with the largest 600 accounting for around half.	城市的人均收入高于农村，因此预计如今世界城市占据着全球收入的80%以上，其中最大的600个城市就占据了一半。
Most of the new jobs over the next few decades will be created in cities, offering livelihoods to hundreds of millions of young people and, as China and Brazil have demonstrated, helping to slash extreme poverty.	未来几十年中新增就业岗位大部分也将出现在城市，为数亿年轻人提供安身立命之本，在中国和巴西等国家更能有助于减少极端贫困。
Cities are also the innovation hubs for public policy.	城市也是公共政策创新中心。
Every day, mayors are called on to get the job done for residents.	每一天，各位市长都必须满足市民的要求。
They are the ones responsible for providing safe water, garbage collection, safe housing, infrastructure, upgraded slums, protection from disasters, and emergency services when catastrophes hit.	他们必须负责提供安全水源、垃圾收集、安全住房、基础设施、改善贫民窟、保护受灾者，以及在灾难发生时采取紧急措施。
So it is not surprising that while national governments often are paralyzed by partisan politics, city governments foster action and innovation.	因此，毫不奇怪，尽管国家政府常常因为党派政治陷入瘫痪，城市政府却在促进行动和创新。
In the United States, for example, Martin O’Malley, Baltimore’s former mayor and now Maryland’s popular governor, pioneered the use of advanced information systems for urban management.	比如，在美国，巴尔的摩前市长、广受欢迎的现任马里兰州州长奥马利（Martin O’Malley）率先使用现金的信息系统来进行城市管理。
New York City’s outgoing mayor, Michael Bloomberg, worked relentlessly to implement a new sustainability plan (called PlaNYC).	即将离任的纽约市市长布隆伯格（Michael Bloomberg）不懈地实施新的可持续计划（即PlaNYC ） 。
And the city’s incoming mayor, Bill de Blasio, is championing a bold program of educational innovations to narrow the vast gaps in income, wealth, and opportunity that divide the city.	而该市即将上任的新市长布拉西奥（Bill de Blasio）正在领导一项大胆的教育创新计划，旨在弥合纽约市所存在的巨大的收入、财富和机会差距。
Sustainable development offers a new concept for the world economy in the twenty-first century.	可持续发展为二十一世纪世界经济提供了新概念。
Rather than focusing solely on income, sustainable development encourages cities, countries, and the world to focus simultaneously on three goals: economic prosperity, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability.	可持续发展鼓励城市国家和世界不再专注于收入，而是同时关注三个目标：经济繁荣、社会包容和环境可持续。
Economic prosperity speaks for itself.	经济繁荣自不待言。
Social inclusion means that all members of society – rich and poor, men and women, majority and minority groups – should have equal rights and equal opportunities to benefit from rising prosperity.	社会包容意味着所有社会成员 — — 无论贫富、男女、多数群体还是少数群体 — — 都应该由平等的权利和平等的从繁荣昌盛中获益的机会。
And environmental sustainability means that we must reorient our economies and technologies to provide basic services like safe water and sanitation, combat human-induced climate change, and protect biodiversity.	环境可持续意味着我们必须改变经济和技术的方向，提供安全水源和卫生措施等基本服务，战胜人类引起的气候变化，并保护生物多样性。
Achieving these three goals will require good governance, public finance, and effective institutions.	实现这三个目标需要良好的治理、公共财政和高效机构。
Cities will be in the front lines of the battle for sustainable development.	城市将是可持续发展之战的最前线。
Not only do they face direct threats; they also have the best opportunities to identify and deliver solutions.	城市不但面临着直接的威胁，也拥有最好的机会认识并给出解决防范。
As high-density, high-productivity settlements, cities can provide greater access to services of all kinds – including energy, water, health, education, finance, media, transport, recycling, and research – than can most rural areas.	作为高密度、高生产率的居民区，城市可以比农村更好地提供各种服务便利，包括能源、水源、卫生、教育、金融、传媒、交通、循环利用和研究。
The great challenge for cities is to provide this access inclusively and sustainably.	城市所面临的重大挑战是包容地、可持续地提供这些服务便利。
A significant part of the solution will come through advanced technologies, including information systems and materials science.	解决方案很大一部分来自技术进步，包括信息系统和材料科学。
The information and communications revolution has spawned the idea of the “smart city,” which places the relevant technologies at the heart of systems that collect and respond to information: smart power grids, smart transport networks (potentially including self-driving vehicles), and smart buildings and zoning.	信息和通信革命催生了“智慧城市”的概念，这一概念将相关技术放在收集信息并据此作出反应的系统的核心，如智能电网、智能交通网（很可能包括自动驾驶汽车 ） 、 智能楼宇和智能区划等。
The advances in materials science open the possibility of much more energy-efficient residences and commercial buildings.	材料科学的进步开启了大量提高住宅楼和商业用楼能源效率的可能性。
Cities also give rise to the opportunity to combine public utilities, as when urban power plants use the steam released in electricity generation to provide hot water and heating to residents.	城市还提供了将整合公用设施的机会，比如让城市发电厂用发电过程中释放的蒸汽提供民用热水和取暖。
Yet technology will be only part of the story.	但技术只是整个故事的一部分。
Cities need to upgrade their governance, to allow for a greater role for poorer and more marginalized communities, and to enable much more effective coordination across city lines when a metropolitan area is home to many individual cities.	城市需要升级其治理体系，让较贫穷、被边缘化的社区起更大作用，并在由许多个体城市组成的大都市圈中促进更有效的协调。
Metropolitan governance is therefore crucial, as smart cities require networks that operate at the metropolitan scale.	因此，大都市治理至关重要，因为智能城市需要能在大都市规模运转的网络。
When the metropolitan scale is recognized, the importance of leading urban areas is even more remarkable.	在大都市规模实现后，领导城市地区的重要性就更加显著了。
New York City has around 8.4 million people, but the NYC metropolitan area has roughly 25 million people, with an economy estimated at about $1.4 trillion per year.	纽约市拥有约840万人口，但纽约市大都市圈拥有约2500万人，每年经济量高达1.4万亿美元。
If this metropolitan area were a country, it would rank about 14th in the world in GDP terms.	如果这一大都市圈是一个国家的话，其GDP将位居世界第14位。
A wise political doctrine known as subsidiarity holds that public-policy challenges should be assigned to the lowest level of government able to address them, thereby ensuring maximum democratic participation in problem solving and the greatest opportunity to tailor solutions to genuine local needs.	被称为辅助性原则（subsidiarity）的政治思想认为，公共政策挑战应该分派给能解决挑战的最低层次的政府，从而在问题解决过程中确保最大化的民主参与，最大限度地让解决方案切合真正的地方需要。
While some issues – for example, a national highway or rail system – require national-level problem solving, many key challenges of sustainable development are best confronted at the urban level.	一些问题 — — 比如全国高速公路或铁路系统 — — 要求国家层面的问题解决机制，但许多可持续发展方面的重要挑战更适合在城市层面解决。
The world’s governments are now negotiating the Sustainable Development Goals, which will guide the world’s development agenda from 2015 to 2030.	世界各国政府正在谈判可持续发展目标（SDG ） ， 这套目标将指导2015—2030年的世界发展日程。
In an important meeting on September 25, the United Nations General Assembly agreed that the SDGs would be adopted at a global summit in September 2015, with the next two years used to select the priorities.	在9月25日的重要会议上，联合国大会一致决定SDG应该在2015年9月的全球峰会上推出，未来两年时间将用于决定优先事项。
An urban SDG, promoting inclusive, productive, and resilient cities, would greatly empower tens of thousands of cities worldwide to take up the cause of sustainable development for their own citizens, their countries, and the world.	承诺建设包容性、高生产率、高恢复力城市的城市SDG将极大地强化全世界几万座城市，帮助它们开启为其市民、国家和世界建设可持续发展的伟业。
	
Why Bill Gates Gets It Wrong	比尔·盖茨为什么错了
NEW YORK – In his review of Nina Munk’s error-filled and out-of-date book, Bill Gates oddly abandons the rigorous approach to measurement and evaluation that defines his foundation’s invaluable work.	纽约—在给妮娜·孟克（Nina Munk）错误百出并且早已过时的书写的书评中，比尔·盖茨反常地抛弃了已成为其基金会宝贵工作的标志 — — 严格的衡量和评估方法。
He simply accepts Munk’s assertion that the Millennium Villages Project – an ongoing development project across more than 20 African countries – has failed.	他简单地接受了孟克关于千年村计划（Millennium Villages Project）失败的论断。
In fact, it is flourishing.	事实上，这一正在20多个非洲国家展开的发展项目可谓方兴未艾。
This credulousness is puzzling.	如此轻信令人感到奇怪。
Munk’s book covers only a sliver of the first half of a ten-year project, and only two of 12 villages.	孟克的书只是对十年计划的前半段略作窥视，并且只考察了12个村庄中的两个。
And she never “lived for extended periods in the Millennium Villages.”	并且她从未“在千年村中生活很长一段时间 。 ”
Munk spent an average of around six days per year – around 36 days over six years – actually visiting the villages, and usually at a stretch of 2-3 days.	事实上，孟克平均每年花六天时间 — — 六年来总共花了36天左右 — — 访问这些村庄，访问期通常为2—3天。
Moreover, she came to the story as a reporter for the magazine Vanity Fair, with no training or experience in public health, agronomy, economics, or African development.	此外，她是以《名利场》记者的身份来到村庄的，她没有接受过公共卫生、农学、经济学和非洲发展等方面的训练，也没有这些方面的经验。
Worse, Munk’s observations frequently seem to have been, at the very least, greatly exaggerated for narrative effect.	更糟��的是，孟克的观察至少因为追求叙事效果而被大大夸张了。
Does Bill Gates really believe that I advocated specific crops without worrying about whether there was a market for them, or that I failed to consider national taxation in my ongoing advice to government leaders?	比尔·盖茨真的相信我会在不考虑是否存在市场的情况下推广某些作物吗？ 我会在不断地给政府领导人所提的建议中不考虑国家税收吗？
Moreover, the agricultural strategies and choices in the MVP have been led by African agronomists, some of the very best in Africa – often working hand in hand with Bill’s own agricultural staff in the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA).	还有，千年村计划的农业战略和选择是有非洲农学家主导的，其中不乏非洲最出色的农业专家 — — 许多人还与比尔自己的非洲绿色革命同盟（Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa，AGRA）的农业工作人员共事。
Bill will be happy to know that the MVP will be properly and professionally evaluated next year – on time at its conclusion (and at the end of the Millennium Development Goals in 2015).	比尔一定很乐于见到千年村计划将在明年得到恰当而专业的评估，以及时得出结论（也正逢2015年千年发展目标（Millennium Development Goals）到期 ） 。
The assessment will be based on the very considerable data that have been collected over the past decade, and on extensive new survey data that will be collected in 2015.	评估将根据过去十年中所收集的大量数据以及将在2015年得到的大量新调查数据做出。
Moreover, the evaluation will include comparisons with areas surrounding the Millennium Villages.	此外，评估还将包括与千年村周边地区的对比。
In fact, I hope that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will help to carry out the detailed, independently supervised survey work needed for a full evaluation of this complex project.	事实上，我希望比尔和梅琳达·盖茨基金会（Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation）能协助组织独立监督的详细调查工作，以满足充分评估这一复杂项目的需要。
Let me provide some more good news, based on the detailed data on community health delivery, morbidity (disease), and mortality that the MVP collects each month.	在这里，我可以提供一些好消息。 这些消息来自千年村计划每月采集的社区卫生服务提供情况、患病率和致死率数据。
Mortality rates are down sharply in the Millennium Villages.	致死率在千年村中出现了显著下降。
In fact, the current evidence, to be examined in greater detail next year, suggests that the bold goal of reducing under-five mortality rates to below 30 deaths per 1,000 births has been achieved or is within reach by 2015, and at a remarkably low cost to the health system.	事实上，就目前的证据而言（这些证据将在明年接受更详尽的考察 ） ， 我们已经实现了让五岁以下儿童致死率下降至千分之三十以下的宏伟目标（或者说可以在2015年实现 ） ， 并且这是在极低的医疗体系成本的条件下实现的。
Recently, one of the Gates Foundation’s senior staff members visited the Millennium Village site in northern Nigeria.	最近，一名盖茨基金会的高级工作人员访问了尼日利亚北部的千年村站点。
Afterwards, he confirmed to me personally that he and his team were deeply impressed by what they saw of the Millennium Village health system in operation.	事后他以个人名义像我确认，他和他的团队对于他们所目睹的千年村医疗体系运营情况印象深刻。
So let me take this opportunity to reiterate a challenge that I have posed to Bill.	在此容我重申一下我对比尔发起的挑战。
He can pick any district in rural Africa, and our team will work with the local communities using the Millennium Village health approach to reduce the under-five mortality rate to below 30/1,000 – a rate characteristic of many middle-income countries – at an annual health-sector cost of just $60 per person.	他可以在非洲农村地区人选一片区域，我们的团队将与当地社区合作，用千年村医疗方法将五岁以下儿童致死率降低到30/1,000 — — 与许多中等收入国家相当的水平 — — 并且每年每人的医疗相关成本只要60美元。
And we will do it in five years or less.	我们可以在五年以内达到这一目标。
That success, I believe, would help Bill and others to recognize the remarkable value of investing in low-cost rural health systems that follow the design principles of the Millennium Village Project.	我相信，这样的成功例子能有助于比尔和其他人认识到，遵循千年村计划的设计原则投资于低成本农村医疗体系大有可为。
Finally, given concerns, shared by Bill, about the MVP’s sustainability and scalability, it is no small matter that host governments are strong advocates of the approach.	最后，出于比尔和其他人对千年村计划的可持续性和可扩展性的担忧，东道国政府强力支持这一方针意义重大。
These governments’ leaders have seen the Millennium Villages day in and day out over almost a decade.	这些政府的领导人在十年的时间里几乎每天都关注着千年村。
They are putting their own money and policies behind expanded implementation of the MVP’s guiding concepts.	他们投入自己的资金和政策支持千年村计划指导概念的日益扩大的实施。
For example, Nigeria has used the MVP concepts for national-scale delivery of health and education services in all 774 of the country’s Local Government Areas.	比如，尼日利亚用千年村计划概念提供全国规模的健康和教育服务，该国774个地方政府区（Local Government Areas）都获得了覆盖。
Governments across the region have taken over $100 million in financing from the Islamic Development Bank to scale up the MVP concepts themselves.	整个地区的各个政府获得了来自伊斯兰开发银行（Islamic Development Bank）的1亿多美元融资用于推广千年村计划概念本身。
Around a dozen countries are now starting or have approached the Millennium Village Project to help them start their own Millennium Villages.	大约十二个国家目前正在接触或已经接触千年村计划帮助建设它们自己的千年村。
And the Pan African Youth Leadership Network, Africa’s own young people, recently visited the Millennium Village in Senegal, and requested the support of the MVP to expand the Millennium Village Project’s techniques and strategies in their home countries and regions.	而由非洲本土年轻人组成的泛非洲青年领导网络（Pan African Youth Leadership Network）最近访问了塞内加尔的千年村，并要求千年村计划支持扩大他们所在国家和地区的千年村计划技术和策略。
This spread of the Millennium Village approach throughout Africa shows that African political and community leaders consider the MVP’s methods, strategies, and systems to be highly useful in combating poverty in rural Africa.	千年村方法在整个非洲的推广表明非洲政治和社会领导人认为千年村计划的方法、策略和体系在帮助非洲农村脱贫方面具有重大意义。
Nina Munk’s book is out of date and misses the mark.	妮娜·孟克的书早已过时，并且没有触及核心。
I invite Bill Gates to visit one or more Millennium Village sites on an upcoming trip to Africa to see first hand why the approach is of such practical interest across the continent.	我邀请比尔·盖茨在即将到来的非洲之行中访问一个或几个千年村站点，现场看一看为何这一方法对整个非洲大陆具有如此重大的意义。
	
Winning the Fight Against Killer Diseases	打赢与致命疾病的斗争
MAPUTO – One of the greatest successes in development aid in the past decade has been the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria.	发自莫桑比克首都马普托 — — 在过去十年的发展援助中所取得的其中一项重大成就莫过于对抗艾滋病，肺结核及疟疾的全球援助。
The Global Fund has saved millions of lives and helped countries around the world beat back three epidemic diseases.	该全球援助基金拯救了数百万条生命并帮助许多国家对抗这三种流行性疾病。
Now it is appealing to the world’s governments and the private sector for another three years of funding, with governments set to decide on further financing in early December in Washington, DC.	如今全球各国将在11月初会聚华盛顿特区讨论是否继续资助的决定，而基金则呼吁各国和私人部门能再追加3年的资助。
Back in 2000, the HIV/AIDS epidemic was devastating the world’s poorest countries, especially in Africa.	让我们回想2000年的时候，艾滋病正在全球最贫穷的国家肆虐，尤其是在非洲。
New antiretroviral medicines had been developed and were being used in rich countries, but were too expensive for the poorest.	而新的抗病毒逆转录药物已经发明并在发达国家推广，但其价格却让穷国望而却步。
Millions of poor people were dying of AIDS, even though the new medicines could have kept them alive.	数百万人因为等不到新药的到来而丧命。
Two other major killer diseases, malaria and TB, were also resurgent.	另外两个主要的致命流行病，疟疾和肺结核，也在卷土重来。
Deaths from malaria were soaring, partly because poor countries’ health systems were dramatically underfunded, and partly because the malaria parasite had developed resistance to the usual medicines.	因疟疾丧生的人数不断攀升，一部分原因是由于穷国的卫生体系严重缺乏资金，另一部分是因为传染疟疾的寄生虫对常用药物已经具有的抗药性。
Yet the potential to control malaria was actually improving, thanks to several newly emerging technologies: long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets to prevent the mosquitos from biting, better diagnostics to identify infections, and a new generation of highly effective medicines.	然而人们控制虐疾的潜在能力实际上在不断改善，因为一系列新型科技：用长效杀虫剂处理过的蚊帐可以防止蚊虫叮咬；更优良的诊断技术去确诊感染疟疾；以及新一代的高效药物。
TB was also running out of control, with a massive disease burden in both Asia and Africa.	肺结核同样也呈现��控状态，为亚洲和非洲国家都带来了巨大的卫生负担。
As with malaria, the TB bacteria had developed resistance to the traditional therapeutic drugs.	跟疟疾类似，肺结核细菌对传统治疗药物产生了抗药性。
A frightening new epidemic of multi-drug-resistant TB – or MDR-TB, which was much harder to treat than mainstream TB – had erupted.	一股令人胆寒的多种抗药性肺结核流行病 — — 比常见肺结核更难医治 — — 已经爆发。
There were also cases of extreme MDR-TB, soon called XDR-TB, which resisted even the back-up medicines.	还有一些极端多种抗药性肺结核的病例连后备的最强效药物都对其无效。
Back in 2000, the rich countries were not taking adequate steps to fight AIDS, TB, and malaria. Aid flows were tiny.	而在2000年时，发达国家也没有采取足够的步骤去对抗这三大疾病，援助金额也不大。
At the time, I had recently been appointed by the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) to help bring finance ministers and health ministers together to see what could be done, both immediately and in the longer term.	那是我刚刚被世界卫生组织总干事任命去召集各国财政和卫生部长共同商议我们在近期和长期上可以做些什么。
Our advisory group, known as the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, recommended that rich countries scale up their health-care aid to poor countries, including efforts to fight AIDS, TB, and malaria.	我们这个名为宏观经济与卫生委员会的顾问团队建议富裕国家扩大对穷国的卫生援助，包括对抗三大疾病的相关行动。
This aid would save lives, improve well-being, and help strengthen economic development.	这些援助将拯救生命，改善社会福祉，并有助于增强经济发展。
Former Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, the remarkable director-general of the WHO at the time, strongly supported this recommendation.	时任世界卫生组织总干事的前挪威首相格罗·哈莱姆·布伦特兰（Gro Harlem Brundtland）大力支持该建议。
At the international AIDS conference in Durban, South Africa, in July 2000, I described why a new global fund was needed to fight AIDS.	在2000年7月于南非德班市举行的国际对抗艾滋病大会上，我上台阐述了为何需要建立一个新的全球基金来对抗艾滋病。
In early 2001, former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan launched a powerful and persuasive appeal to establish the Global Fund.	在2001年初，前联合国秘书长科菲·安南（Kofi Annan）启动了一场强大并极具说服力的呼吁行动来建立全球基金会。
Leaders around the world responded to Annan’s call; within months, the Global Fund was born.	世界各国的领袖们都对安南的呼吁做出了回应；几个月内，全球基金会宣告成立。
I remember those days vividly.	那些情景依然在我的脑海里萦绕着。
In international public-health circles, there was great excitement.	对国际卫生健康圈内人来说，这是件极为振奋人心的事情。
Yet there was also frustration and bewilderment, as vocal opponents of foreign aid began to oppose the increased funding for disease control.	但除此之外也有挫折和困惑，因为那些对外援助的反对者开始抗议对疾病控制增加资助。
Several economists with little knowledge of public health became outspoken opponents.	一些对公共卫生知之甚少的经济学家变成了极富煽动性的反对者。
They argued on the basis of free-market ideology rather than evidence, claiming that foreign aid always fails.	他们的观点并非基于事实证据而是来自于自由市场理念，认定对外援助总是以失败告终。
Fortunately, world leaders listened to public-health specialists and not to the aid skeptics.	幸运的是，各国领袖们在这些援助质疑者和公共卫生专家和之间选择了后者。
US President George W. Bush’s administration provided strong and important support for the Global Fund – and also created new US programs to fight AIDS and malaria.	美国的小布什政府为全球基金会提供了强大而重要的支持 — — 同时也创立了一系列对抗艾滋和疟疾的新美国公共项目。
By the second half of the 2000’s, programs to fight the three main killer communicable diseases were scaling up around the world.	在2005~2010年间，对抗这三种致命传染性疾病的项目在全球广泛推广开来。
Over the objection of the aid skeptics, the Global Fund provided financial support for massive free distribution of bed nets, diagnostics, and medicines to address malaria.	在援助质疑者的反对声中，全球基金会为大规模发放蚊帐，诊断技术和抗疟疾药物提供了资金支持。
Lo and behold, for the first time in a generation, deaths from malaria in Africa began to fall (steeply in some places).	令人惊叹地，在这一代人的时间中，非洲的疟疾死亡人数首次出现了下降（尤其是在某些地区 ） 。
Hundreds of thousands of lives, mainly African children, were now being saved every year.	每年都有数十万条生命（主要是儿童）得到了挽救。
Children were spared not only death but also debilitating infections, enabling them to attend school and lead more productive lives in the future.	这些孩子们不但远离了死亡还避免了导致虚弱的感染，使他们得以上学并拥有一个更加丰硕的未来生活。
The same thing happened with HIV/AIDS and TB.	同样的事情也发生在艾滋病和肺结核方面。
Back in 2000, before the Global Fund was established, infected people in developing countries died of AIDS without any chance to receive life-saving antiretroviral medicines.	在全球基金会尚未创立的2000年时，发展中国家的艾滋病感染者根本无法获得任何维持生命以及抗病毒逆转录药物。
By 2010, more than six million people in developing countries were receiving antiretroviral treatment.	而到了2010年，超过600万发展中国家感染者得到了抗病毒逆转录治疗。
Similarly, testing and treatment for TB rose sharply, including a strong increase in several heavily affected Asian countries.	类似的是，针对肺结核患者的检测和治疗数量大幅上升，包括在几个患者数量极大的亚洲国家。
The aid skeptics were proved wrong.	援助质疑者们的观点最终被证明是错误的。
Aid for health has worked.	卫生援助是有效的。
The world has benefited enormously from the triumph of generosity, professionalism, common decency, and good sense.	全世界都从这场慷慨，专业主义，高尚公益理念以及良好意愿的胜利中大大受益。
Yet the battle to mobilize adequate financing remains.	然而动员足够资助的挑战依然在继续。
The same skeptics repeat their tired opposition without reference to a decade of evidence.	那些质疑者们依然无视十年以来的成果，继续他们的那套陈词滥调。
It is shocking how their free-market fundamentalism (or simply ideological opposition to aid of any kind) can blind them to life-and-death needs and the efficacy of practical approaches that are well known to health professionals. (They are also blind to professional methods in other areas, such as food production.)	令人震惊的是他们那套自由市场原教旨主义（或者对任何援助都统统反对的意识形态）令他们无视关乎他人生死的需要以及卫生专家们熟知的操作手段所产生的效力（这些反对者们也无视其它领域的专业运作方式，比如食品行业 ） 。
The Global Fund is urgently appealing for a minimum of $5 billion per year for the next three years – a tiny sum relative to the world economy (and equal to roughly $5 per person in the high-income countries).	全球基金会正迫切呼吁在未来3年内每年最少筹集50亿美元 — — 这相对于全球经济总量来说只是九牛一毛（或等于发达国家每人拿出大约5美元 ） 。
It could wisely use twice that amount.	就算把这个金额加多一倍基金会也会明智地去运用。
It seems likely that the US Government will agree to contribute one-third of the $5 billion if the rest of the world delivers the remainder.	目前看来如果世界其它国家能提供这50亿美元的2/3的话美国政府就会补齐剩下的1/3。
The United Kingdom recently made a strong pledge, and the world now awaits the announcements of Germany, Canada, Australia, Japan, and other long-standing and new donor countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.	英国政府最近做出了一个明确承诺，而世界正等待着德国、加拿大、澳大利亚，日本以及其它来自欧洲，中东和亚洲的长期和新捐助国做出行动。
Millions of people around the world will live, or die, depending on what these governments decide in December.	各国政府在11月的决定将影响数百万人的生死。
May they, and we, choose life.	希望这些政府以及我们每一个人都能选择生命的一方。
	
The Waste of War	战争的废墟
NEW YORK – Karl Marx famously wrote that history repeats itself, “the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.”	纽约 — — 卡尔·马克思的名言是历史会不断重复上演 ， “ 第一次是悲剧，第二次是闹剧 。 ”
Yet when we look around nowadays, we can’t help but wonder whether tragedy will be followed by yet more tragedy.	但当今局势却令我们不由怀疑悲剧后面是否还有更多的悲剧。
Here we are, at the centenary of the outbreak of World War I, and we find ourselves surrounded by cascading violence, duplicity, and cynicism of the very sort that brought the world to disaster in 1914.	恰逢一战爆发一百周年，我们身边随处可见的暴力、欺骗和玩世不恭却与1914年曾令世界陷入灾难的毫无二致。
And the world regions involved then are involved again.	当时深陷其中的地区现在仍在参与。
WWI began with a mindset, one based on the belief that military means could resolve pressing social and political issues in Central Europe.	一战爆发是因为人们相信军事手段能解决紧迫的中欧社会及政治问题。
A century earlier, the German military theorist Carl von Clausewitz had written that war is “a continuation of political intercourse carried on with other means.”	一个世纪前，德国军事理论家卡尔·冯·克劳塞维茨曾写道战争是“其他政治交往方式的延续 ” 。
Enough politicians in 1914 agreed.	1914年时他的说法得到了很多政治家的支持。
Yet WWI proved Clausewitz tragically wrong for modern times.	但克劳塞维茨的悲剧性错误在一战中得到了证实。
War in the industrial age is tragedy, disaster, and devastation; it solves no political problems.	工业时代的战争实质是悲剧、灾难和破坏；战争根本解决不了政治问题。
War is a continuation not of politics, but of political failure.	战争并非政治的延续，而是政治失败的标志。
WWI ended four imperial regimes: the Prussian (Hohenzollern) dynasty, the Russian (Romanov) dynasty, the Turkish (Ottoman) dynasty, and the Austro-Hungarian (Habsburg) dynasty.	一战结束了普鲁士（霍亨索伦）王朝、俄罗斯（罗曼诺夫）王朝、土耳其（奥斯曼）王朝和奥匈（哈布斯堡）王朝等四大帝国政权。
The war not only caused millions of deaths; it also left a legacy of revolution, state bankruptcy, protectionism, and financial collapse that set the stage for Hitler’s rise, World War II, and the Cold War.	这场战争不仅导致数百万人死于非命；还带来了革命、国家破产、保护主义和金融崩溃，为希特勒崛起、二战和冷战做好了准备。
We are still reeling today.	这场战争带来的动荡一直持续到今天。
Territory that was once within the multi-ethnic, multi-state, multi-religious Ottoman Empire is again engulfed in conflict and war, stretching from Libya to Palestine-Israel, Syria, and Iraq.	从利比亚到巴勒斯坦-以色列、叙利亚、伊拉克等曾经归属于多民族、多国家、多宗教的奥斯曼帝国的领土如今再次陷入到战争和动乱当中。
The Balkan region remains sullen and politically divided, with Bosnia and Herzegovina unable to institute an effective central government and Serbia deeply jolted by the 1999 NATO bombing and the contentious independence of Kosovo in 2008, over its bitter opposition.	巴尔干地区继续在政治上四分五裂，波斯尼亚和黑塞哥维那无法���立有效的中央政府，而塞尔维亚则仍无法释怀于西方国家置其强烈反对于不顾，强制实施1999年北约轰炸和2008年充满争议的科索沃独立。
The former Russian Empire is in growing turmoil as well, a kind of delayed reaction to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, with Russia attacking Ukraine and violence continuing to erupt in Georgia, Moldova, and elsewhere.	前俄罗斯帝国的动荡同样愈演愈烈，俄罗斯进攻乌克兰，格鲁吉亚、摩尔多瓦和其他地方不断发生暴力活动都是1991年苏联解体带来的滞后反应。
In East Asia, tensions between China and Japan – echoes of the last century – are a growing danger.	东亚中国和日本之间的紧张关系 — — 同样是上个世纪的遗留问题 — — 同样变得越来越危险。
As was the case a century ago, vain and ignorant leaders are pushing into battle without clear purpose or realistic prospects for resolution of the underlying political, economic, social, or ecological factors that are creating the tensions in the first place.	就像一个世纪前一样，虚荣无知的领导人正在推动一场战争，却没有解决从一开始造成紧张局势的政治、经济、社会或生态因素的现实前景和明确目的。
The approach of too many governments is to shoot first, think later.	太多政府奉行先行动、再思考的策略。
Take the US.	以美国为例。
Its basic strategy has been to send troops, drones, or bombers to any place that would threaten America’s access to oil, harbors Islamic fundamentalists, or otherwise creates problems – say, piracy off the coast of Somalia – for US interests.	派军队、无人机或轰炸机袭击可能威胁美国石油控制、窝藏伊斯兰原教旨主义者或有损美国利益（比方说索马里海岸海盗）的任何区域一直是美国的基本战略。
Hence, US troops, the CIA, drone missiles, or US-backed armies are engaged in fighting across a region stretching from the Sahel in West Africa, through Libya, Somalia, Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and beyond.	美军、中情局、无人机导弹或由美国支持的武装势力也因此一直在从西非萨赫勒到利比亚、索马里、也门、叙利亚、伊拉克、阿富汗等广大地区奋力作战。
All of this military activity costs hundreds of thousands of lives and trillions of dollars.	这一切军事活动不仅耗资数万亿美元，还造成数十万人因此丧生。
But, rather than solving a single underlying problem, the chaos is growing, threatening an ever-widening war.	但这不仅未能解决问题，反而造成混乱不断扩大，甚至可能引起一场不断升级的战争。
Russia is not handling itself any better.	俄国的做法也并没高明到哪去。
For a while, Russia backed international law, rightly complaining that the US and NATO were violating international law in Kosovo, Iraq, Syria, and Libya.	有段时间俄国支持国际法，合理地抱怨美国和北约在科索沃、伊拉克、叙利亚和利比亚存在违反国际法的行径。
But then President Vladimir Putin took aim at Ukraine, fearing that the country was about to drop into Europe’s pocket.	但之后普京总统瞄上了乌克兰，害怕这个国家迟早会倒向欧洲。
Suddenly, he was silent about obeying international law.	突然，他绝口不提遵守国际法。
His government then illegally annexed Crimea and is fighting an increasingly brutal guerrilla war in eastern Ukraine, through proxies and, it now appears, direct engagement of Russian forces.	他的政府之后非法吞并了克里米亚，并借助傀儡势力现在貌似还有俄国军队的直接参与，在东乌克兰进行一场越来越残酷的游击战争。
In this context, the fate of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 is terrifying not only for its brutality, but also in its intimation of a world gone mad.	在这样的背景下，马航MH17的命运不仅残酷得可怕，还让我们看清了这个疯狂的世界。
At the time of this writing, those who aimed and fired the missile remain unknown, though Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine are the most likely culprits.	写这篇文章的时候，瞄准并发射导弹的人仍未能确定，虽然由俄罗斯支持的东乌克兰反政府武装最有可能是罪魁祸首。
What is certain, however, is that the violence unleashed by Putin’s war on Ukraine has claimed hundreds of innocent lives and brought the world a step closer to disaster.	但可以肯定，普京发动乌克兰战争所释放的暴力已经夺走了数百条无辜的生命，并把世界进一步推向灾难的深渊。
There are no heroes among the great powers today.	今天的大国不存在任何英雄。
Cynicism is rife on all sides.	玩世不恭随处可见。
The US effectively violates international law by resorting to force without United Nations sanction.	美国未经联合国批准擅自动武是违反国际法的行为。
It sends drones and secret forces into sovereign countries without their approval.	它在未获首肯的情况下派遣无人机和秘密部队进入主权国家。
It spies relentlessly on friend and foe alike.	敌人和朋友同样都处在它无情的暗中监视中。
Russia does the same, inflicting death on Ukraine, Georgia, and other neighbors.	俄罗斯也效法美国，在乌克兰、格鲁吉亚和其他邻国导致民众丧生。
The only constants in all of this are the easy resort to violence and the lies that inevitably accompany it.	其中唯一不变的是在不可避免的谎言陪衬下非常草率地以武力解决问题。
There are four major differences between now and the world of 1914.	当前和1914年的世界局势有四大主要不同。
For starters, we have since lived through two disastrous wars, a Great Depression, and a Cold War.	首先，其后我们已经经历了两次灾难性的战争，一次大萧条和一次冷战。
We have had the opportunity to learn a thing or two about the stupidity and uselessness of organized collective violence.	我们已经多少有机会了解有组织集体暴力的愚蠢和无用。
Second, the next global war, in this nuclear age, would almost surely end the world.	其次，核时代的全球战争几乎等同于世界末日来临。
The third major difference is that today, with our wondrous technologies, we have every opportunity to solve the underlying problems of poverty, hunger, displacement, and environmental degradation that create so many dangerous tinderboxes.	第三点主要区别是今天因为有了奇妙的技术，我们有机会解决产生那么多火药桶的潜在的贫困、饥饿、流离失所和环境破坏问题。
Finally, we have international law, if we choose to use it.	最后还有国际法，如果我们愿意使用。
The belligerents in Europe and Asia 100 years ago could not turn to the UN Security Council and UN General Assembly, venues where diplomacy, rather than war, can be the true continuation of politics.	100年前欧洲和亚洲的交战国无法向联合国安理会和联合国大会求助。 在这样的场合，真正成为政治延续的是外交而非战争。
We are blessed with the possibility to construct peace through a global institution that was founded to help ensure that global war would never recur.	我们有可能通过全球机构去建设和平，而确保永远不再爆发全球战争恰恰是这些全球机构的初衷。
As citizens of the world, our job now is to demand peace through diplomacy, and through global, regional, and national initiatives to address the scourges of poverty, disease, and environmental degradation.	身为世界公民，我们现在的任务是通过外交手段来实现和平，通过全球、地区和全国性举措来解决贫困、疾病和环境破坏等灾难性问题。
On this hundredth anniversary of one of the greatest disasters of human history, let us follow tragedy not by farce or more tragedy, but by the triumph of cooperation and decency.	值此人类历史上最大灾难一百周年之际，让我们杜绝悲剧之后接踵而至的闹剧或悲剧，代之以合作和尊严的胜利。
	
Responding to Ebola	响应埃博拉
NEW YORK – The horrific Ebola epidemic in at least four West African countries (Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria) demands not only an emergency response to halt the outbreak; it also calls for re-thinking some basic assumptions of global public health.	纽约—可怕的埃博拉瘟疫在至少四个西非国家肆虐（几内亚、利比里亚、塞拉利昂和尼日利亚 ） ， 我们不仅需要紧急响应以阻止瘟疫爆发，还必须反思全球公共健康的一些基本假设。
We live in an age of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases that can spread quickly through global networks.	我们生活在一个传染病新发和再发频繁、能够迅速通过全球网络蔓延的时代。
We therefore need a global disease-control system commensurate with that reality.	因此，我们需要一个与适应这一现实的全球疾病控制体系。
Fortunately, such a system is within reach if we invest appropriately.	幸运的是，只要我们投资得当，这样一个体系是可以获得的。
Ebola is the latest of many recent epidemics, also including AIDS, SARS, H1N1 flu, H7N9 flu, and others.	埃博拉是大量新近爆发的瘟疫的最新例子，其他还有艾滋病、非典、H1N1流感、H7N9流感等。
AIDS is the deadliest of these killers, claiming nearly 36 million lives since 1981.	艾滋病是这些致命瘟疫中最凶险的，自1981年以来已夺走了近3,600万人的生命。
Of course, even larger and more sudden epidemics are possible, such as the 1918 influenza during World War I, which claimed 50-100 million lives (far more than the war itself).	当然，还有可能爆发更大更突然的瘟疫，如爆发于1918年一战期间、夺走5,000万—1亿人生命（远远多于战争本身）的大流感。
And, though the 2003 SARS outbreak was contained, causing fewer than 1,000 deaths, the disease was on the verge of deeply disrupting several East Asian economies including China’s.	而尽管2003年非典爆发得到了遏制，只有不到1,000人死亡，但仍险些给多个东亚经济体（包括中国）造成巨大影响。
There are four crucial facts to understand about Ebola and the other epidemics.	要理解埃博拉和其他瘟疫，需要考察四个事实。
First, most emerging infectious diseases are zoonoses, meaning that they start in animal populations, sometimes with a genetic mutation that enables the jump to humans.	首先，大部分新发传染病是人畜共患病，这意味着它们首先在动物中间流传，有时通过基因突变获得人传染性。
Ebola may have been transmitted from bats; HIV/AIDS emerged from chimpanzees; SARS most likely came from civets traded in animal markets in southern China; and influenza strains such as H1N1 and H7N9 arose from genetic re-combinations of viruses among wild and farm animals.	埃博拉可能是从蝙蝠身上传来的；艾滋病来自黑猩猩；非典可能来自华南动物市场贸易中的果子狸；H1N1和H7N9等流感菌株来自野生和圈养动物病毒的基因重组。
New zoonotic diseases are inevitable as humanity pushes into new ecosystems (such as formerly remote forest regions); the food industry creates more conditions for genetic recombination; and climate change scrambles natural habitats and species interactions.	随着人类进入新生态系统（如此前地处偏远的森林地区 ） ， 新的人畜共患病是难以避免的；食品业为基因重组创造了更好的条件；气候变化扰乱了自然栖息地和物种间互动。
Second, once a new infectious disease appears, its spread through airlines, ships, megacities, and trade in animal products is likely to be extremely rapid.	其次，一旦新传染病出现，就可以通过航空、水路、大城市和动物产品贸易传播，蔓延速度可能及其迅速。
These epidemic diseases are new markers of globalization, revealing through their chain of death how vulnerable the world has become from the pervasive movement of people and goods.	这些传染病是全球化的新标签，通过死亡链条凸显出无处不在的人流和物流让世界变得多么脆弱。
Third, the poor are the first to suffer and the worst affected.	第三，穷人首当其冲并且受影响最大。
The rural poor live closest to the infected animals that first transmit the disease.	农村贫困人口与受感染动物生活得最近，也是第一个染上疾病的群体。
They often hunt and eat bushmeat, leaving them vulnerable to infection.	他们常吃野味，因此很容易被传染。
Poor, often illiterate, individuals are generally unaware of how infectious diseases – especially unfamiliar diseases – are transmitted, making them much more likely to become infected and to infect others.	贫穷（通常没什么文化的）个人一般而言不了解传染病（特别是不熟悉的传染病）是如何传播的，这使得他们更加容易被感染并传染给别人。
Moreover, given poor nutrition and lack of access to basic health services, their weakened immune systems are easily overcome by infections that better nourished and treated individuals can survive.	此外，由于营养不良和难以获得基本卫生服务，他们的免疫系统较弱，即使是可以通过充分的营养和得当的治疗攻克的瘟疫也能轻易摧毁他们。
And “de-medicalized” conditions – with few if any professional health workers to ensure an appropriate public-health response to an epidemic (such as isolation of infected individuals, tracing of contacts, surveillance, and so forth) – make initial outbreaks more severe.	而“无医 ” （ de-medicalized）环境 — — 没有或很少有专业卫生工作者确保针对瘟疫的合理公共委身响应（如隔离被传染者、跟踪社交情况、监控病情，等等 ） — —导致初始爆发更加严重。
Finally, the required medical responses, including diagnostic tools and effective medications and vaccines, inevitably lag behind the emerging diseases.	最后，必要的卫生响应，包括诊断工具和特效医药和疫苗，难免会落后于新瘟疫的爆发。
In any event, such tools must be continually replenished.	无论如何，这些工具必须随时保持充分。
This requires cutting-edge biotechnology, immunology, and ultimately bioengineering to create large-scale industrial responses (such as millions of doses of vaccines or medicines in the case of large epidemics).	这需要尖端生物技术、免疫学和生物工程以形成大规模工业响应能力（如在大瘟疫爆发时生产几百万分疫苗或药品 ） 。
The AIDS crisis, for example, called forth tens of billions of dollars for research and development – and similarly substantial commitments by the pharmaceutical industry – to produce lifesaving antiretroviral drugs at global scale.	比如，艾滋病危机促使人们投入数十亿美元用于研发 — — 制药业也投入了相当规模的资金 — — 以生产救命的抗逆转录药物供全球使用。
Yet each breakthrough inevitably leads to the pathogen’s mutation, rendering previous treatments less effective.	但每一次突破都免不了导致病原体的变异，让此前的疗法效果减弱。
There is no ultimate victory, only a constant arms race between humanity and disease-causing agents.	没有最终胜利，只有人类和致病菌株之间的永恒的军备竞赛。
So, is the world ready for Ebola, a newly lethal influenza, a mutation of HIV that could speed the transfer of the disease, or the development of new multi-drug-resistant strains of malaria or other pathogens?	那么，世界准备好迎接埃博拉、新致命流感、能够加速艾滋病蔓延的病毒变异，或新的具有多重抗药性的疟疾或其他细菌病毒了吗？
The answer is no.	答案是否定的。
Though investment in public health increased significantly after 2000, leading to notable successes in the fights against AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, there has recently been a marked shortfall in global spending on public health relative to need.	尽管自2000年以来公共卫生投资显著增长，并在与艾滋病、结核病和疟疾的斗争中取得了重大胜利，但最近全球公共卫生支出的规模与需要之间出现了显著差距。
Donor countries, failing to anticipate and respond adequately to new and ongoing challenges, have subjected the World Health Organization to a debilitating budget squeeze, while funding for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria has fallen far short of the sums needed to win the war against these diseases.	出资国没有充分预料和响应新旧挑战，这导致世界卫生组织（World Health Organization）饱受预算不足掣肘，而全球对抗艾滋病、结核病和疟疾基金（Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria）远远不足以让我们在这场战争中取得胜利。
Here is a shortlist of what urgently needs to be done.	有一些问题紧迫地需要解决。
First, the United States, the European Union, the Gulf countries, and East Asian states should establish a flexible fund under WHO leadership to combat the current Ebola epidemic, probably at an initial level of $50-$100 million, pending further developments.	首先，美国、欧盟、海湾国家和东亚国家应该在世卫组织的领导下建立一个灵活的基金以对抗当前的埃博拉疫情，初始规模可以在5,000万到1亿美元，未来可以按需追加。
This would allow a rapid public-health response that is commensurate to the immediate challenge.	这将让我们得以建立针对眼前的紧迫挑战的快速公共卫生响应。
Second, donor countries should quickly expand both the Global Fund’s budget and mandate, so that it becomes a global health fund for low-income countries.	其次，出资国应该迅速增加全球基金的预算和权限，以使其成为低收入国家的全球健康基金。
The main goal would be to help the poorest countries establish basic health systems in every slum and rural community, a concept known as Universal Health Coverage (UHC).	主要目标应是帮助最贫穷国家在每一个贫民窟和农村社区建立基本卫生体系，这一概念被称为全球卫生覆盖（Universal Health Coverage，UHC ） 。
The greatest urgency lies in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where health conditions and extreme poverty are worst, and preventable and controllable infectious diseases continue to rage.	最紧迫的地区是撒哈拉以南非洲和南亚，那里的卫生条件最差，极端贫困最严重，可防可控瘟疫仍在肆虐。
In particular, these regions should train and deploy a new cadre of community health workers, trained to recognize disease symptoms, provide surveillance, and administer diagnoses and appropriate treatments.	特别是，这些地区应该培训和部署新的社区卫生工作者骨干队伍，识别疾病症状、提供疫情监控，并实施诊断和合理治疗。
At a cost of just $5 billion per year, it would be possible to ensure that well-trained health workers are present in every African community to provide lifesaving interventions and respond effectively to health emergencies like Ebola.	只要每年花50亿美元，就有望保证受过良好训练的工作者遍布每一个非洲社区提供救命干预、有效响应埃博拉等卫生经济状况。
Finally, high-income countries must continue to invest adequately in global disease surveillance, the WHO’s outreach capacities, and life-saving biomedical research, which has consistently delivered massive benefits for humanity during the past century.	最后，高收入国家必须继续投入充足资金用于全球疾病监控、增加世卫组织的能力、救命的生物医学研究。 在过去一百年中，生物医学一直在为人类提供大量好处。
Despite tight national budgets, it would be reckless to put our very survival on the fiscal chopping block.	尽管国家预算吃紧，但放任我们的生存被财政问题束缚住是极不负责任的。
	
From Moscow to Sochi	从莫斯科到索契
NEW YORK – The Winter Olympics in Sochi are the first to be hosted by Russia since the Cold War-era Moscow Summer Games in 1980.	纽约—索契冬奥会是冷战期间莫斯科举办1980年夏奥会后俄罗斯第一次举办奥运会。
Obviously, much has changed politically in the interim.	显然，在此期间，政治面貌有了很大的改变。
But today’s Games also create an opportune moment to look back at Russia’s recent economic history – and to peer forward as well.	但这次奥运会仍是一次很好的契机，可以借此回顾俄罗斯最近一段时间的经济史并展望未来。
Many people who remember the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and its tumultuous aftermath believe that Russia’s economy today must be impoverished and unstable – and far behind booming China.	许多记得1991年苏联解体及其混乱后果的人认为如今的俄罗斯经济一定是穷困而不稳定的 — — 并且远远落后于繁荣的中国。
Wrong. According to the International Monetary Fund, Russia’s per capita income in 2013, measured in terms of purchasing power parity, is roughly $18,600, nearly double China’s per capita income of around $10,000.	据国际货币基金组织（IMF）的数据，2013年俄罗斯人均收入（以购买力平价衡量）大约为18,600美元，是中国人均收入10,000美元的近两倍。
And, according to World Bank data, extreme poverty is close to zero, compared to 11.8% in China in 2009 (the most recent year for which data are available).	而根据世界银行的数据，2009年（目前为止的最新数据）俄罗斯极端贫困率接近于零，而中国是11.8 % 。
Yes, Russia’s economy has been buoyed recently not only by sound macroeconomic policies, but also by high world oil and gas prices.	是的，助推俄罗斯经济的不但有可靠的宏观经济政策，也有世界油价和气价高涨的因素。
In fact, the collapse of world oil prices after 1985 contributed to the severe economic crisis in the Soviet Union and Russia in the late 1980’s and early 1990’s.	事实上，1985年世界油价崩盘造成了20世纪80年代末苏联和90年代初俄罗斯的严重经济危机。
This is an important point, given that the economic reforms implemented by former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and former Russian President Boris Yeltsin thus confronted powerful headwinds.	这一点很重要，因为前苏联总统戈尔巴乔夫和前俄罗斯总统叶利钦的经济改革因此面临着强大的阻力。
For two years (1992-1993), I was a macroeconomic adviser to Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar and Finance Minister Boris Fyodorov, trying to help Russia to end the high inflation and extreme shortages that characterized the last years of the Soviet era, and to begin Russia’s transition to a market economy.	在1992年和1993年这两年中，我是俄罗斯总理盖达尔（Yegor Gaidar）和财政部长费奥德罗夫（Boris Fyodorov）的经济顾问，试图帮助俄罗斯结束困扰苏联最后几年的高通胀和极度短缺，并开启俄罗斯的市场经济转型。
I recommended a macroeconomic stabilization strategy that had been highly successful in nearby Poland, and that called for timely financial assistance from the United States, Europe, and the IMF, just as Poland had received.	我所建议的宏观经济稳定战略在临近的波兰取得过极大的成功，该战略需要美国、欧洲和IMF的及时的金融援助，就像波兰所得到的那样。
Unfortunately, the West did not provide the needed financial assistance, contrary to my (and many other people’s) recommendations, and the Russian economic and financial calamity was more severe as a result.	不幸的是，和我（以及其他许多人）的建议相反，西方没有提供需要的金融援助，俄罗斯经济和金融业因此陷入了更严重的危机。
At the time, I attributed Western inaction to incompetence on the part of the US government and the IMF.	当时我将西方的不作为归咎于美国政府和IMF的不称职。
Looking back, it is clear that there was also a deliberate strategy by US neoconservatives, such as then-Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, to weaken the new Russian state.	现在回想起来，显然这也是时任国防部长切尼（Dick Cheney）等美国新保守主义有意为之，目的是削弱新的俄罗斯国。
The US government was also complicit during the mid-1990’s in the plundering of Russian state-owned property, including oil assets that were unscrupulously privatized.	美国政府在90年到中期俄罗斯国有资产大掠夺（包括被无序私有化的石油资产）中也起到了帮凶作用。
The good news is that Russia was able to bounce back from those terrible years, no thanks to the West or the US government.	好消息是是俄罗斯能够在没有西方和美国政府援助的情况下从可怕年景中恢复过来。
Russia’s market economy, albeit marred by corruption, took root.	俄罗斯的市场经济尽管饱受腐败影响，但仍立稳了脚跟。
After several years of political infighting and unnecessary delay, macroeconomic stabilization was achieved, and Russia’s economic growth was restored, especially as world oil and gas prices began to rise.	在多年的政治内斗和毫无必要的拖延后，宏观经济终于实现了稳定，俄罗斯经济增长也得到了恢复，特别是在世界石油和天然气价格开始回升之后。
From 2001 to 2013, Russia’s GDP grew at a robust 4.4% average annual rate.	从2001年到2013年，俄罗斯GDP以平均每年4.4%的速度强健地增长着。
Russia achieved a good measure of financial stability as well.	俄罗斯在金融稳定方面也表现卓著。
The IMF puts Russia’s inflation rate at 6.9% in 2013, with unemployment at 5.5%, while the budget deficit was just 0.3% of GDP.	IMF预测俄罗斯2013年通胀率为6.9 % ， 失业率为5.5 % ， 但预算赤字只占GDP的0.3 % 。
Moreover, Russia’s foreign-exchange reserves stand at a healthy $500 billion.	此外，俄罗斯的外汇储备也相当健康，高达5,000亿美元。
But Russia could achieve still greater success by basing its economy on two growth engines rather than one.	但如果俄罗斯经济可以用两条而不是一条增长之腿走路，还能取得更大的成功。
Oil and gas will continue to provide a strong lift to Russia for years to come, especially as China becomes a major customer.	在未来几年中，石油和天然气将继续为俄罗斯提供强大的推动力，特别是在中国成为主要客户的情况下。
Yet Russia also has vast and still under-developed potential in many global high-tech industries.	但俄罗斯在许多全球高科技行业还有巨大的未开发的潜力。
During the Soviet era, Russia produced a vast array of technology-based industrial products, from airplanes to computers to sophisticated machine goods.	在苏联时代，俄罗斯生产种类繁多的基于科技的工业产品，飞机、电脑、复杂机械都是他们的强项。
Unlike Chinese industry, Russia’s manufacturing branches were almost completely cut off from world markets, both by the Cold War and by Soviet planning.	与中国的工业不同，拜冷战和苏联计划经济所赐，俄罗斯制造业几乎与世界市场完全脱节。
When post-Soviet Russia opened itself to trade, its industrial enterprises lagged far behind cutting-edge technologies, especially in the dynamic information and communications technology (ICT) sector.	当后苏联时代的俄罗斯开放自身拥抱贸易时，其工业企业在尖端科技方面大大落后了，特别是动态信息和通信技术（ICT）部门。
Many industries collapsed, owing to neglect, lack of international partners, and financial chaos.	由于被忽视、缺少国际合作者和金融混乱等因素，许多行业都崩溃了。
Those that survived did so only barely, with greatly reduced output going mainly to the ex-Soviet market.	存活下来的行业也只是勉强生存，大幅下降后的产出也主要流向前苏联市场。
Russia has the know-how, skilled engineering, and natural-resource base to become a global competitor in a range of major high-tech industries, including nuclear energy, commercial aviation, commercial space technology (including satellites and GPS), ICT hardware and software, electric vehicles, high-speed rail, petrochemicals, and heavy equipment for the mining and hydrocarbon sectors. All of these industries will benefit from the potential for enormous demand growth in large markets, such as China, Africa, and India.	俄罗斯拥有雄厚的技术、工程和自然资源基础，能够在一系列主要高科技行业成为全球竞争者，包括和能源、商业航空、商业空间技术（包括卫星和GPS ） 、 ICT硬件和软件、电动汽车、高速铁路、制药和矿业和能源业重型设备等等。
But achieving long-term growth led by high-tech industries requires a business environment that encourages private-sector investment, including openness to foreign players.	但实现高科技行业推动的长期增长需要鼓励私人部门投资的商业环境，包括对外国竞争的开放性。
Moreover, the social and political environment must be conducive to a high-tech labor force, providing an attractive quality of life, ensuring civil liberties, and supporting entrepreneurship and creativity.	此外，社会和政治环境必须有利于高科技劳动力，提供有吸引力的生活质量、保证公民自由、支持企业家精神和创造力。
Finally, economic policies must promote technological advances and global technical cooperation in promising sectors.	最后，经济政策必须有利于技术进步和新型部门的全球科技合作。
It is notable that Russia recently completed an agreement to finance a nuclear power plant in Hungary, and looks likely to do the same in Turkey.	值得注意的是，俄罗斯最近完成了匈牙利核电厂的融资协议，并有望在土耳其也签署类似的协议。
The demand for nuclear energy will grow as part of the global effort to decarbonize the world energy system.	核能源的需求将作为世界能源系统脱碳化的全球效应的一部分而出现增长。
Russia’s new reactors seem to be safe and competitive with those produced elsewhere.	俄罗斯的新反应堆安全性好，并对其他国家的产品有竞争优势。
Similarly, we might see new Russian-built civilian aircraft entering the global market in partnership with international firms, especially those that can work with Russian companies on advanced ICT avionics.	类似地，我们可以看到俄罗斯产民用飞机在国际公司和合作下进入全球市场，特别是那些可以在先进ICT设备上与俄罗斯公司合作的企业。
Back in 1991, many thought that Russia could not end high inflation, adopt a market economy, or compete effectively in world markets.	1991年，许多人认为俄罗斯不可能摆脱高通胀、采取市场经济并在世界市场上展开高效竞争。
Two decades later, Russia has proved the skeptics wrong.	二十年后，俄罗斯证明了怀疑派是错误的。
Yes, Russia remains too dependent on oil and gas, and should move further on transparency, openness, and competition in business and governance.	是的，俄罗斯仍然太依赖于石油和天然气，也应该进一步在商业和治理方面实现透明、开放和竞争。
Yet the trend is positive: Russia has become a stable, high-income market economy, with strong prospects for decades of rapid GDP growth and high-tech progress if it pursues a sensible economic strategy in the coming years.	但趋势是积极的：俄罗斯已成为稳定的高收入市场经济体，如果在未来几年中采取明智的经济战略，俄罗斯未来几十年中将迎来GDP的高速增长和高科技进步。
	
The Age of Sustainable Development	可持续发展时代
NEW YORK – A half-century ago, John F. Kennedy observed that, “man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life.”	纽约—半个世纪前，约翰·肯尼迪观察道 ： “ 人类可以依靠平凡的双手战胜一切人类贫困，打造任何人类生活 。 ”
Those words speak to us today with special urgency.	这番话对于今天有着特别紧迫的意义。
Our generation can indeed end the ancient scourge of extreme poverty.	我们这一代人可以真正结束自古以来一直存在的极端贫困。
Yet it can also destroy the earth’s life-support system through human-induced environmental devastation.	但人为造成的环境破坏也有可能毁掉地球的生命支持系统。
By necessity, then, we have entered The Age of Sustainable Development.	因此，我们已经不可避免地进入了可持续发展时代。
So I am enormously excited to be launching a free, global, online university course by the same name in January 2014. (Those interested in joining the course can register here.)	令我感到极为振奋的是，2014年，同名免费全球性在线大学课程将上线运营（如果你感兴趣，可以在这里注册 ） 。
I hope that people all over the world will join the course – and then join the generation-long quest to achieve sustainable development.	我希望全世界人民都加入到这个课程来，你也将同时加入实现可持续发展的跨越几代人的追求。
Sustainable development is both a way of understanding the world and a way to help save it.	可持续发展既是认识世界的方法，也是拯救世界的方法。
As a method of understanding the world, sustainable-development practitioners study the interactions of the economy, the environment, politics, and culture and how they influence prosperity, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability.	从认识世界角度讲，可持续发展实践者研究经济、环境、政治和文化的互动及其对繁荣、社会包容和环境可持续性的影响。
Students of sustainable development must therefore learn about a wide range of subjects, including economic development, education, health care, climate change, energy systems, biodiversity, and urbanization, among others.	因此，可持续发展学生必须学习广泛的课程，包括经济发展、教育、医疗、气候变化、能源体系、生物多样性、城市化，等等。
As a method of helping to save the world, sustainable development encourages a holistic approach to human well-being, one that includes economic progress, strong social bonds, and environmental sustainability.	从拯救世界的角度讲，可持续发展鼓励用全面的视角审视人类福利，这一视角囊括了经济进步、强大的社会联系和环境可持续性。
The challenges are becoming more urgent as the large and rapidly growing world economy causes massive environmental destruction, and as new technologies demand new skills.	随着规模庞大、快速增长的世界经济造成了巨大的环境破坏，以及新的技术要求新的技能，挑战也正在变得日益紧迫。
Young people without the appropriate training and skills are likely to find few opportunities for decent jobs and incomes.	没有受过适当训练、掌握适当技能的年轻人可能很难找到体面工作和收入。
I predict that sustainable development will become the organizing principle for our politics, economics, and even ethics in the years ahead.	我预测，几年后，可持续发展将成为我们的政治、经济甚至伦理方面的组织原则。
Indeed, the world’s governments have agreed to place it at the very center of the world’s post-2015 development agenda.	事实上，世界各国政府已经同意将可持续发展作为2015年后世界发展日程的核心。
They will soon adopt Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which will help guide the world to a safer and fairer twenty-first-century trajectory.	它们很快将实施可持续发展目标（SDG ） ， 并在该目标的指引下建设更安全、更公平的21世纪世界。
Just as the Millennium Development Goals, adopted in 2000, have proved highly effective in the fight against poverty and disease, the SDGs (which will succeed the MDGs in two years) promise to address the global challenges that we face in areas including energy, food, water, climate, and jobs.	正如2000年开始实施的千年发展目标（MDG）在与贫困和疾病斗争方面表现出极高的成效，SDG（将在两年后接棒MDG）将解决我们在能源、粮食、水、气候和就业等方面所面临的全球挑战。
I also believe that global, free, online teaching about sustainable development can help to propel global solutions.	我还相信，可持续发展方面的全球免费在线课程能有助于推进全球解决方案。
Online global courses are part of the world’s ongoing information revolution – a revolution that is now fundamentally reshaping higher education, most importantly by creating new avenues of access for more people around the world.	全球在线课程是方兴未艾的信息革命的一部分 — — 这一个名正在重塑高等教育格局，其最重要的特征是为全世界更多的人创造了获得高等教育的渠道。
I know this from personal experience.	对于这一点，我个人深有体会。
For most of my years as a professor, the basic educational technologies did not change much.	在我多年的教授生涯���，基本教学技术并无太多变化。
I stood in front of a class and gave a 57-minute lecture.	我站在讲台上讲课，每堂课大概57分钟。
Yes, the blackboard gave way to an overhead projector, and then to PowerPoint, but otherwise the basic classroom “technology” changed little.	是的，黑板逐渐被投影仪取代，投影仪又被PowerPoint取代，但尽管如此，基本教室“技术”并未改变。
Yet, with the new information technologies, higher education (and of course education at other levels) is suddenly changing.	但是，在新信息技术的带动下，高等教育（当然也包括其他层次的教育）突然发生了改变。
Courses can now incorporate a lot more information – data, videos, and even live chats with experts halfway around the world.	如今，课程可以嵌入很多新信息 — — 数据、视频甚至与半个地球之外的专家实时沟通。
More and more people worldwide can access free, high-quality educational materials that previously were available only to a lucky few.	全世界越来越多的人可以获得昔日只有少数幸运儿才能获得的高质量教学资源。
This is especially important today, because the challenges of sustainable development will require knowledgeable and educated citizens everywhere.	这在今天尤其重要，因为可持续发展的挑战要求各国都拥有渊博之士和受过教育的公民。
According to recent data, online university courses have already reached students in more than 190 countries, enabling them to watch lectures, take quizzes, and interact with fellow students and professors.	从最新数据看，在线大学课程已经触及190多个国家的学生，他们可以观看课程、参加测验、与同学和教授交流。
Online education is transforming the classroom experience as well.	在线教育也在改变课堂体验。
Now, rather than watch me lecture for 57 minutes, my students at Columbia University can watch the online lectures ahead of time, permitting a much richer, in-depth discussion in the classroom.	如今，我的哥伦比亚大学学生们不再仅仅出席教室聆听我57分钟的讲课，而是可以事先观看在线授课，这带来了更丰富、更深刻的课堂讨论。
In the years ahead, I believe that all of us will have to become leaders in sustainable development in our homes, communities, and countries.	我相信，几年后，我们所有人都会变成家庭、社区和国家的可持续发展领袖。
Millions of young people will soon have to help solve problems of climate change, water, energy, transportation, and education.	数百万年轻人和快就能为解决气候变化、水、能源、交通和教育等问题出力。
Thousands of cities and 200 countries around the world will need to rally all stakeholders – government, communities, experts, business, and non-governmental organizations – to play their roles, and open online education will be key to disseminating the information they need.	全世界200个国家的数千城市将需要联合所有相关利益方 — — 政府、社区、专家、商界和非政府组织 — — 扮演各自角色，而开放在线教育将是传播它们所需要的信息的关键。
For these reasons, I am also pleased that my course will be part of a more general education program of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, an initiative under the auspices of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that I am honored to direct.	出于这些原因，我很高兴自己的课程能成为可持续发展解决方案网（SDSN）普通教育计划的一部分，该计划由联合国秘书长潘基文倡议，我荣幸地担任主管。
The SDSN mobilizes scientific and technical expertise from academia, civil society, and the private sector in support of sustainable-development problem solving at local, national, and global scales.	SDSN动员来自学界、公民社会和私人部门的科学和技术专家支持地方、国家和全球层面的可持续发展问题解决方案。
One of the SDSN’s key objectives is to reach students all over the world by developing and disseminating online materials for sustainable-development curricula.	SDSM的一个关键目标是通过开发和传播在线可持续发展课程素材，并送到全世界学生面前。
More than a dozen institutions have already committed to incorporating The Age of Sustainable Development into their own classes, tailored for their own local circumstances and issues.	已有十多个机构承诺将可持续发展时代纳入它们的课程体系中，并根据自身环境和问题改编。
The SDSN will encourage the world’s universities to participate in the new era of global online teaching.	SDSN将鼓励全世界各大学参与到全球在线教育新时代中来。
The goal will be to equip today’s young people to use wisely the power that will soon pass into their own hands to help address the world’s great challenges.	SDSN的目标是将我们的本领传授该年轻人，让他们能够明智地使用学到的知识，帮助战胜世界所面临的大挑战。
	
Putin’s Perilous Course	普京的危险行为
NEW YORK – The dangers of the crisis in Ukraine cannot be exaggerated.	纽约—乌克兰危机的危险怎么强调都不为过。
Russian President Vladimir Putin is overtly and covertly inciting separatism in eastern Ukraine, and has declared Russia’s unilateral right to intervene there, in complete contravention of international law.	俄罗斯总统普京公开和暗地里都在煽动东乌克兰的分裂，并宣布俄罗斯有单边干预乌克兰的权利，完全不顾国际法。
Russia’s provocative policies are putting it on a collision course with the West.	俄罗斯的挑衅性政策正在与西方产生碰撞。
Putin explained his point of view in a recent television appearance: Russia’s current international borders are provisional, determined by accidents of history, such as the transfer of Crimea from Russia to Ukraine in 1954, or the transfer of Russian territories to eastern Ukraine in the 1920’s.	普京在最近的电视讲话中解释了自己的观点：俄罗斯目前的边界是暂时性的，是由历史事件确定的 — — 如1954年克里米亚由俄罗斯转给乌克兰以及20世纪20年代俄罗斯领土转给东乌克兰。
Putin claims that it is Russia’s right and duty to defend ethnic Russians in neighboring countries, especially in light of the arbitrariness of the existing borders.	普京声称，俄罗斯有权利和义务捍卫邻国的俄罗斯族，特别是在现有边界不清不楚的情况下。
If ethnic Russians call for a return to Russia, Putin asserts, then Russia must heed their call.	普京声称，如果俄罗斯族要求回归俄罗斯，那么俄罗斯就必须响应他们的要求。
Putin pointedly reminded listeners that eastern Ukraine was called “Novorossiya” (New Russia) in Czarist times, clearly implying that it could be Novorossiya again.	普京尖锐地向听众指出，东乌克兰在沙皇时代被称为“Novorossiya ” （ 新俄罗斯 ） ， 显然，如今那里可以再次成为Novorossiya。
Evidently, Putin believes that relentless pressure and claims over neighboring states, designed to undermine their sovereignty and force them to accede to Russian demands, will result in a stronger Russia, better able to confront the West.	显然，普京认为对邻国不断施加旨在破坏其主权、迫使其接受俄罗斯要求的压力和主张能让俄罗斯更强大、更有能力对抗西方。
In the recent past, Russia sharply opposed American and NATO military intervention in Libya, Syria, and Serbia on the grounds that the West was violating those countries’ sovereignty.	从最近的事件看，俄罗斯强烈反对美国和北约军事干预利比亚、叙利亚和塞尔维亚，理由是西方侵犯了这些国家的主权。
Now Putin claims the right to ignore neighboring countries’ sovereignty on the pretext that Russia is merely defending the rights of ethnic Russians abroad, up to and including their right to secede and join the Russian homeland.	如今，普京又声称有权利忽视邻国的主权，而原因仅仅是俄罗斯要捍卫海外俄罗斯族的权利，包括他们脱离所在国家加入俄罗斯祖国的权利。
Putin no doubt hopes to create facts on the ground – as in Crimea – without provoking a severe Western reaction.	显然，普京希望在不引起西方强烈反弹的情况下营造既成事实 — — 就像在克里米亚那样。
Even without an invasion, Russia can use threats, displays of military power, secret operations, and heated rhetoric to destabilize its neighbors.	即使不采取入侵，俄罗斯也可以使用威胁、陈兵、秘密行动和慷慨陈词动摇邻国。
That may be enough to achieve Russian foreign-policy aims, including its neighbors’ docility.	这可能已足以实现包括令邻国就范在内的俄罗斯外交政策目标。
But Putin’s adventurism is likely to end very badly for Russia.	但普京的铤而走险可能给俄罗斯带来极坏的后果。
Though the West is justifiably reticent to be drawn into any military confrontations with Russia beyond NATO’s boundaries, and is even reluctant to apply economic sanctions, Putin’s actions have triggered a strong and growing anti-Russian backlash in the US and Europe.	尽管西方极有可能不会在北约边界之外的地方与俄罗斯形成军事冲突，甚至不太愿意采取经济制裁，但普京的行动已经引发了美国和欧洲日益增长的强烈的反俄情绪。
The West’s response will intensify dramatically if Russia deploys forces across its borders, whatever the pretext; should Russia adopt subtler methods of political destabilization, Western pressure will build more gradually, but build it will.	如果俄罗斯军队越过边界，不管寻找什么借口，都会引起西方反应的强烈升级；如果俄罗斯采取暗中政治动摇的方针，那么西方的压力将积累得更加缓 — — 仍在积累，只是慢一些。
Existing trade, investment, and financial relations between Russia and the West are already becoming severely frayed.	现有俄罗斯与西方之间的贸易、投资和金融关系已经遭到了严重破坏。
New investment projects and joint ventures are being put on hold.	新投资项目和合资企业被叫停。
Loans from Western investors to Russian entities are being called in.	西方投资者给俄罗斯机构的贷款也被叫停。
Russian banks and companies will face a growing credit squeeze.	俄罗斯银行和公司将面临日益加剧的信用压力。
In the short term, Russia has ample foreign-exchange reserves to offset capital outflows; but the reversal of capital flows will begin to bite within a matter of months.	在短期，俄罗斯拥有足够的外汇储备抵消资本外流，但资本流逆转的后果将在几个月后显露。
Following Russia’s forcible takeover of Crimea, it is almost unimaginable that normal economic relations between Russia and the West could survive Russian intervention, subversion, or annexation elsewhere in Ukraine.	在俄罗斯暴力吞并克里米亚后，很难想象俄罗斯还能在干预、颠覆或吞并乌克兰其他地区的情况下与西方维持正常的经济关系。
In other words, if Cold War II sets in, as appears increasingly likely, Russia would be the long-term economic loser.	换句话说，如果第二次冷战真的爆发（可能性越来越高 ） ， 俄罗斯将是长期经济输家。
The European Union can certainly survive without imports of Russian natural gas, even with a full cutoff.	欧盟显然可以在不进口俄罗斯天然气甚至完全切断俄罗斯天然气的情况下活下去。
Russia’s gas exports to Europe constitute less than 10% of the EU’s primary energy consumption.	俄罗斯对欧天然气出口只占欧盟初级能源消费的不到10 % 。
Russia, on the other hand, would suffer a major loss of revenues.	而俄罗斯却会因此受到巨大的收入损失。
Putin seems to believe that Russia can offset any worsening of economic relations with the West by strengthening its economic relations with China.	普京似乎认为俄罗斯可以通过加强其与中国的经济关系抵消一切与西方经济关系的恶化。
But technologies and business are too globally intertwined to divide the world into economic blocs.	但科技和商业是全球互通的，很难将世界割裂为数个经济区。
China knows that its long-term economic prosperity depends on good economic relations with the US and Europe.	中国知道其长期经济繁荣取决于与其美国与欧洲的良好经济关系。
Putin seems not to understand this point, or even the fact that the Soviet economy collapsed as a result of its isolation from technologically advanced economies.	普京似乎没有认清这一点，甚至也没有认清苏联经济是因为被技术更先进的经济体孤立才崩溃的这一事实。
Russia’s future economic strength depends on its ability to upgrade technologies in key sectors, including aviation, high-speed rail, automobiles, machinery, and heavy industry.	俄罗斯的未来经济优势取决于其能否实现关键部门的技术升级，包括航空、高速铁路、汽车、机械和重工业等。
That can be achieved only if Russian companies are more closely integrated into global production networks that knit them together with German, Japanese, American, and Chinese firms that rely on cutting-edge technology and advanced engineering.	而这只有在俄罗斯公司紧密地融入全球生产网络、与依赖尖端科技和先进工程技术的德国、日本、美国和中国公司打成一片才能实现。
Of course, matters could become much worse.	当然，情况可能远比这糟糕。
A new cold war could all too easily turn hot.	新冷战极有可能转变为热战。
Many in the US are already calling for arming Ukraine as a deterrent to Russia.	许多美国人已经在呼吁武装乌克兰，以此威慑俄罗斯。
But, while military deterrence sometimes works, the West should emphasize trade and financial retaliation, rather than military responses to Russian provocations.	但是，尽管军事威慑有时会有效，但西方应该强调贸易和金融关系而不是以军事方式应对俄罗斯的挑衅。
Military responses could provoke disaster, such as turning Ukraine into a Syria-type battlefield, with untold thousands of deaths.	军事反应可能造成灾难，让乌克兰沦为第二个叙利亚，让成千上万人因此丧生。
There can be no doubt that NATO will defend its own members if necessary.	毫无疑问，北约会在必要时捍卫其成员国。
But Russia’s belligerency and appalling behavior should not permit Western hardliners to gain control of the policy debate.	但不能因为俄罗斯骇人听闻的战争行为而让强硬派主宰西方政策争论。
Hardline approaches brought expanded conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria, leading to plenty of deaths but not to meaningful political or economic solutions in the affected countries.	强硬路线在阿富汗、伊拉克、利比亚和叙利亚造成了冲突扩大，导致大量死亡，却没有为受影响国家带来有意义的政治或经济解决方案。
War is not politics by other means.	战争绝非另辟蹊径的政治手段。
War is mayhem and suffering.	战争只能带来死伤和灾难。
Putin is no doubt acting in Ukraine with domestic politics very much in mind, using his adventurism abroad to shore up his political base at home.	毫无疑问，普京对乌克兰的动作有其国内政治考虑，利用其对外政策的冒险巩固国内政治基础。
The Russian economy is flagging, and the population is weary of repression, not to mention Russia’s pervasive corruption.	俄罗斯经济陷入了停滞，俄罗斯人民受够了压抑，更不用说俄罗斯无处不在的腐败了。
Russia’s annexation of Crimea and threat to invade eastern Ukraine appear to be hugely popular.	俄罗斯吞并克里米亚并威胁入侵东乌克兰似乎受到了人民的热烈欢迎。
It remains a terrifying reality that politicians often perceive war to be an antidote to internal weakness.	政客们常常把战争作为国内失势的解毒剂，这是个令人恐惧的现实。
Both Russia and the West have played fast and loose with international law in recent years.	近几年来，俄罗斯与西方都把国际法玩弄于鼓掌之间。
The West violated national sovereignty in Serbia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria.	西方侵犯了塞尔维亚、阿富汗、伊拉克、利比亚和叙利亚的主权。
Russia is now playing the same card with shocking brazenness in its own neighborhood, often justifying its actions by pointing to Western precedents.	而如今，俄罗斯带着令人震惊的厚颜无耻对自己的邻国如法炮制，常常援引西方先例来为自己开脱。
But Russia’s true long-term interests lie in multilateralism, integration into the world economy, and the international rule of law.	但俄罗斯真正的长期利益在于多边主义、融入世界经济以及国际法治精神。
Putin’s current path is strewn with grave hazards.	普京当前的道路充满了巨大的风险。
He is undermining Russia’s economic prospects, while confronting the world with a growing threat of war.	他正在破坏俄罗斯的经济前景，也让世界面对日益增加的战争可能。
Our only hope is that all sides return to the principles of international law, which they have forsaken for too long.	我们唯一的希望是各方回归被它们抛弃已久的国际法原则。
	
The Limits of Climate Negotiations	气候谈判的局限
NEW YORK – If the world is to solve the climate-change crisis, we will need a new approach.	纽约—如果世界想要解决气候变化危机，我们就需要新方法。
Currently, the major powers view climate change as a negotiation over who will reduce their CO2 emissions (mainly from the use of coal, oil, and gas).	目前，主要大国将气候变化视为一场关于谁减少二氧化碳排放（主要来自煤炭、石油和天然气的使用）的谈判。
Each agrees to small “contributions” of emission reduction, trying to nudge the other countries to do more.	所有人都同意为减排做出小“贡献 ” ， 而让其他国家承担更多责任。
The United States, for example, will “concede” a little bit of CO2 reduction if China will do the same.	比如，美国将在减少二氧化碳方面做出一些“让步 ” ， 条件是中国也这样做。
For two decades, we have been trapped in this minimalist and incremental mindset, which is wrong in two key ways.	二十年来，我们一直陷于这一最小值和增量思维陷阱中。 这一思维存在两个关键问题。
First, it is not working: CO2 emissions are rising, not falling.	首先，它并没有奏效：CO2 排放在增加而不是在减少。
The global oil industry is having a field day – fracking, drilling, exploring in the Arctic, gasifying coal, and building new liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities.	全球石油工业正在开动马力 — — 致裂、钻井、在北冰洋勘探、煤气化、建设新的液化天然气设施。
The world is wrecking the climate and food-supply systems at a breakneck pace.	世界正在以极快的速度威胁气候和粮食供给系统。
Second, “decarbonizing” the energy system is technologically complicated.	其次，能源系统的“去碳化”在技术上十分复杂。
America’s real problem is not competition from China; it’s the complexity of shifting a $17.5 trillion economy from fossil fuels to low-carbon alternatives.	美国的真正问题不是来自中国的竞争；而是实现规模达到17.5万亿美元的经济从化石燃料转向低碳替代燃料的复杂性。
China’s problem is not the US, but how to wean the world’s largest, or second largest economy (depending on which data are used) off its deeply entrenched dependence on coal.	中国的问题不在于美国，而在于如何让这个世界第一大或第二大（取决于使用和中数据）经济体摆脱对煤炭的深度依赖。
These are mainly engineering problems, not negotiating problems.	这些问题主要是工程问题，而不是谈判问题。
To be sure, both economies could decarbonize if they cut output sharply.	平信而乱，若能大幅削减产出，中美都可以去碳化。
But neither the US nor China is ready to sacrifice millions of jobs and trillions of dollars to do so.	但中美都不准备为这一目的而牺牲数百万工作岗位和数万亿美���。
Indeed, the question is how to decarbonize while remaining economically strong.	事实上，问题在于如何既实现去碳化，有保持经济强劲。
Climate negotiators cannot answer that question, but innovators like Elon Musk of Tesla, and scientists like Klaus Lackner of Columbia University, can.	气候谈判员无法回答这个问题，但特斯拉（Tesla）的艾龙·马斯克（Elon Musk）这样的创新者和哥伦比亚大学的克劳斯·莱克纳（Klaus Lackner）这样的科学家可以。
Decarbonizing the world’s energy system requires preventing our production of vast and growing amounts of electricity from boosting atmospheric CO2 emissions. It also presupposes a switchover to a zero-carbon transport fleet and a lot more production per kilowatt-hour of energy.	实现世界能源系统去碳化需要阻止我们规模巨大并且仍在日渐增长的发电活动增加大气中的二氧化碳排放；也需要世界向零碳交通和大幅提高每千瓦时能源产量靠拢。
Zero-carbon electricity is within reach.	零碳电已有希望实现。
Solar and wind power can deliver that already, but not necessarily when and where needed.	太阳能电和风电即属此列，但还无法实现全天候、全覆盖。
We need storage breakthroughs for these intermittent clean-energy sources.	我们需要实现这些间歇性清洁能源资源储存方面的突破。
Nuclear power, another important source of zero-carbon energy, will also need to play a big role in the future, implying the need to bolster public confidence in its safety.	另一个重要的零碳能源资源 — — 核电也应该在未来大放异彩，这意味着需要增加公众对核电安全的信心。
Even fossil fuels can produce zero-carbon electricity, if carbon capture and storage is used.	即使是化石燃料，也可以产生零碳电，如果采取碳捕捉和储存（碳捕存）技术的话。
Lackner is a world leader in new CCS strategies.	莱克纳便是新碳捕存战略的世界领袖。
Electrification of transport is already with us, and Tesla, with its sophisticated electric vehicles, is capturing the public’s imagination and interest.	交通电气化已经成为了现实，特斯拉公司携其先进的电动汽车抓住了公众的想象力和兴趣。
Yet further technological advances are needed in order to reduce electric vehicles’ costs, increase their reliability, and extend their range.	但我们需要进一步的科技进步以降低电动汽车成本、增加电动汽车可靠性、扩大电动汽车范围。
Musk, eager to spur rapid development of the vehicles, made history last week by opening Tesla’s patents for use by competitors.	马斯克热切地希望刺激电动汽车的开发，在上周做出了历史性的决定，向竞争对手开放特斯拉的专利。
Technology offers new breakthroughs in energy efficiency as well.	科技也在能源效率方面带来了新突破。
New building designs have slashed heating and cooling costs by relying much more on insulation, natural ventilation, and solar power.	新建筑设计通过更多依靠隔离、自然通风和太阳能降低取暖和制冷成本。
Advances in nanotechnology offer the prospect of lighter construction materials that require much less energy to produce, making both buildings and vehicles far more energy efficient.	纳米技术的进步为我们提供了更轻质、生产过程消耗能源更少的建筑材料，大大提高了建筑和汽车的能源效率。
The world needs a concerted push to adopt to low-carbon electricity, not another “us-versus-them” negotiation.	世界需要集中力量推动低碳电的普及，而不需要另一场“我们和他们”的谈判。
All countries need new, low-carbon technologies, many of which are still out of commercial reach.	所有国家都需要新的低碳科技，其中许多仍不具有经济可行性。
Climate negotiators should therefore be focusing on how to cooperate to ensure that technology breakthroughs are achieved and benefit all countries.	因此，气候谈判员应该将注意力集中在如何合作以确保实现科技突破并惠及所有国家上。
They should take their cue from other cases in which government, scientists, and industry teamed up to produce major changes.	他们应该从政府、科学家和产业界合作带来重大变化的例子中吸取教训。
For example, in carrying out the Manhattan Project (to produce the atomic bomb during World War II) and the first moon landing, the US government set a remarkable technological goal, established a bold timetable, and committed the financial resources needed to get the job done.	比如，在曼哈顿计划（二战期间制造原子弹的计划）和首次登月中，美国政府设立了一个宏大的技术目标，制定了雄心勃勃的时间表，并投入必要的金融资源实现目标。
In both cases, the scientists and engineers delivered on time.	在这两个计划中，科学家和工程师按时完成了任务。
The example of atomic bombs might seem an unpleasant one, yet it raises an important question: If we ask governments and scientists to cooperate on war technology, shouldn’t we do at least the same to save the planet from carbon pollution?	原子弹的例子也许令人不快，但它引出了一个一个重要问题：既然我们要求政府和科学家合作开发战争技术，为何不在拯救地球免于碳污染的问题上也这样做呢？
In fact, the process of “directed technological change,” in which bold objectives are set, milestones are identified, and timelines are put into place, is much more common than many realize.	事实上 ， “ 有指导的科技变迁 ” （ directed technological change）过程 — — 包括宏伟的目标、各个里程碑事件的确定以及实施时间表 — — 比许多人认为的要普遍得多。
The information-technology revolution that has brought us computers, smart phones, GPS, and much more, was built on a series of industry and government roadmaps.	给我们带来电脑、智能电话、GPS和其他许多东西的信息技术革命便建立在一系列产业和政府路线图的基础上。
The human genome was mapped through such a government-led effort – one that ultimately brought in the private sector as well.	人类基因组也是通过这样的政府领导（最终页引入了私人部门）项目被勾勒出来的。
More recently, government and industry got together to cut the costs of sequencing an individual genome from around $100 million in 2001 to just $1,000 today.	更晚近一些，2001年政府和产业界合力将个人基因组测序成本从2001年的大约1亿美元下降到今天的区区1,000美元。
A dramatic cost-cutting goal was set, scientists went to work, and the targeted breakthrough was achieved on time.	此过程设立了一个巨幅削减成本的目标，科学家们孜孜以求并按时实现了预定的突破。
Fighting climate change does depend on all countries having confidence that their competitors will follow suit.	遏制气候变化确实依赖于每个国家都相信竞争对手也会齐头并进的信心。
So, yes, let the upcoming climate negotiations spell out shared actions by the US, China, Europe, and others.	因此，诚然，让即将到来的气候谈判使美国、中国、欧洲和其他地区精诚合作。
But let’s stop pretending that this is a poker game, rather than a scientific and technological puzzle of the highest order.	但我们不能假装这只不过是一场扑克游戏，而不是最高级别的科学和科技难题。
We need the likes of Musk, Lackner, General Electric, Siemens, Ericsson, Intel, Electricité de France, Huawei, Google, Baidu, Samsung, Apple, and others in laboratories, power plants, and cities around the world to forge the technological breakthroughs that will reduce global CO2 emissions.	我们需要马斯克、莱克纳、通用电气、西门子、爱立信、英特尔、法国电力、华为、谷歌、百度、三星、苹果以及其他世界各地的实验室、发电厂和城市齐心协力促进能减少全球二氧化碳排放的科技突破。
There is even a place at the table for ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, Peabody, Koch Industries, and other oil and coal giants.	甚至埃克森美孚、雪佛龙、英国石油、皮博迪（Peabody ） 、 柯氏工业（Koch Industries）和其他石油和煤炭巨头也能有所助益。
If they expect their products to be used in the future, they had better make them safe through the deployment of advanced CCS technologies.	如果它们期待它们的产品在未来仍有用途，就必须通过开发先进的碳捕存技术让产品更加安全。
The point is that targeted and deep decarbonization is a job for all stakeholders, including the fossil-fuel industry, and one in which we must all be on the side of human survival and wellbeing.	要点在于定向的深度去碳化是所有相关利益方的共同责任，包括化石燃料业；也是一个我们必须一致站在人类生存和福利立场上的责任。
	
Ukraine and the Crisis of International Law	乌克兰与国际法危机
NEW YORK – Russia’s actions in Ukraine constitute a serious and dangerous violation of international law.	纽约—俄罗斯在乌克兰的行为构成了对国际法的严重且危险的挑战。
In 1994, Ukraine agreed to give up the nuclear weapons it had inherited from the Soviet Union, in return for a solemn commitment by the United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia to protect Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.	1994年，乌克兰同意放弃从苏联继承的核武器，以此换取美国、英国和俄罗斯保护乌克兰领土完整和主权的庄严承诺。
Russia has now violated that pledge, not only harming Ukraine but also undermining the international legal framework for preventing nuclear proliferation.	如今，俄罗斯违反了这一承诺，不但伤害了乌克兰，也破坏了防止核扩散的国际法框架。
Unless Russia changes course – which seems unlikely anytime soon – the global consequences are apt to be grave.	除非俄罗斯改变行为 — — 近期看来可能性渺茫 — — 否则全球后果将相当严重。
The US and the European Union will impose sanctions, weakening Russia’s economy and the world economy – and stoking even more tension and nationalism.	美国和欧盟将实施制裁，削弱俄罗斯和世界经济 — — 并带来更多的对立和民族主义。
Mistakes on one side or the other could lead to violent disaster.	每一方的错误都可能导致暴力灾难。
We need only to recall the spiral of hubris and miscalculation that led to the outbreak of World War I, a century ago this year.	对此我们只要回忆一下距今恰好一百年前的一战前的傲慢和失误循环就可了解到这一点。
As frightening as the Ukraine crisis is, the more general disregard of international law in recent years must not be overlooked.	乌克兰危机是可怕的，同样可怕的是近几年来世界对国际法越来越不放在眼里，这一问题不容忽视。
Without diminishing the seriousness of Russia’s recent actions, we should note that they come in the context of repeated violations of international law by the US, the EU, and NATO.	我们不应该淡化俄罗斯最近行为的严重性，与此同时，我们也应该注意到俄罗斯的行为是在美国、欧盟和北约一再违反国际法的���景下做出的。
Every such violation undermines the fragile edifice of international law, and risks throwing the world into a lawless war of all against all.	上述三者每一次违反国际法的行为都会令这座脆弱的制度建筑雪上加霜，增加了让世界陷入无法可言的战争汪洋的风险。
The US and its allies have also launched a series of military interventions in recent years in contravention of the United Nations Charter and without the support of the UN Security Council.	近几年来，美国及其盟国还发动了一系列违反联合国宪章且未经联合国安理会支持的军事干预。
The US-led NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999 lacked the sanction of international law, and occurred despite the strong objections of Russia, a Serbian ally.	以美国为首的北约在1999年对塞尔维亚的轰炸便未受到国际法的认可，并且是在塞尔维亚盟国俄罗斯的强烈反对下发生的。
Kosovo’s subsequent declaration of independence from Serbia, recognized by the US and most EU members, is a precedent that Russia eagerly cites for its actions in Crimea.	随后，科索沃宣布脱离塞尔维亚独立并获得美国和大部分欧盟国家承认，这些先例被俄罗斯在其克里米亚行动中大肆援引。
The ironies are obvious.	讽刺之处显而易见。
The Kosovo War was followed by the US-led wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, both of which occurred without the support of the Security Council, and in the case of Iraq, despite vigorous objections within it.	科索沃战争之后是美国领导的阿富汗战争和伊拉克战争，后两者亦未受到安理会支持，伊拉克战争还受到了安理会内部的强烈反对。
The results for both Afghanistan and Iraq have been utterly devastating.	阿富汗和伊拉克战争最后都成为车头车尾的灾难。
NATO’s actions in Libya in 2011 to topple Muammar el-Qaddafi constituted another such violation of international law.	2011年，北约推翻利比亚卡扎菲政权的行为是其违反国际法的又一显例。
After the Security Council approved a resolution to institute a no-fly zone and take other actions ostensibly to protect Libyan civilians, NATO used the resolution as a pretext to overthrow Qaddafi’s regime through aerial bombardment.	此前，安理会批准了一项决议建立禁飞区并采取其他行动保护利比亚平民，而北约将这一决议作为用空中轰炸推翻卡扎菲政权的接口。
Russia and China strenuously objected, stating then and now that NATO seriously exceeded its mandate.	俄罗斯和中国强烈反对，指出（不论是当时还是现在）北约严重超越了它的权限范围。
Libya remains unstable and violent, without an effective national government, to this day.	利比亚至今仍处于动荡和暴力状态，没有产生有效的国家政府。
As Russia itself has repeatedly pointed out, US actions in Syria have been similarly illegal.	正如俄罗斯本身一再指出的，美国在叙利亚的行为也是不合法的。
When the Arab Spring protests began in early 2011, peaceful demonstrators in Syria demanded reforms.	当2011年初阿拉伯之春示威爆发时，叙利亚的和平示威者要求改革。
President Bashar al-Assad’s regime cracked down violently on the protesters, leading some military units to revolt.	总统巴沙尔·阿萨德政权用暴力镇压示威者，导致一些军师团体揭竿而起。
At that point, in the summer of 2011, the US began to back the military insurrection, with President Barack Obama declaring that Assad must “step aside.”	此时（2011年夏 ） ， 美国开始支持军事暴动，美国总统奥巴马声称巴沙尔必须“下台 ” 。
Since then, the US, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others have provided logistical, financial, and military support to the insurrection, in violation of Syria’s sovereignty and international law.	自此以后，美国、沙特阿拉伯、土耳其和其他国家为叛军提供了物流、金融和军事支持，侵害了叙利亚主权，也违反了国际法。
There is no doubt that Assad has behaved cruelly, but there is also no doubt that the US-led support of the insurrection is a violation of Syria’s sovereignty, one that has contributed to an upward spiral of violence that by now has claimed more than 130,000 Syrian lives and destroyed much of the country’s cultural heritage and infrastructure.	毫无疑问，巴沙尔确实犯下了暴行，但同样毫无疑问的是美国领导的支持叛军的行为侵害了叙利亚主权，助长了暴力循环的升级，至今已造成130,000多叙利亚人丧生，毁掉了叙利亚的文化遗产和基础设施。
One can add many other US actions, including drone strikes on the territory of sovereign states without their governments’ permission; covert military operations; renditions and torture of terror suspects; and massive spying by the US National Security Agency.	美国类似的行为还有很多，包括在未经主权国家政府许可的情况下用无人机袭击它们的领土；引渡和虐待嫌疑恐怖分子；以及美国国安局的大规模间谍行动等。
When challenged by other countries or UN organizations, the US has brushed aside their objections.	当其他国家或联合国组织对此提出挑战时，美国对他们的反对置若罔闻。
International law itself is at a crossroads.	国际法本身也站在十字路口。
The US, Russia, the EU, and NATO cite it when it is to their advantage and disregard it when they deem it a nuisance.	美国、俄罗斯、欧盟和北约都按自己的需要利用或唾弃它。
Again, this is not to justify Russia’s unacceptable actions; rather, it is to add them to the sequence of actions contrary to international law.	再一次指出，这并不能证明俄罗斯不可接受的行为是合法的；恰恰相反，这证明了俄罗斯的行为违反了国际法。
The same problems may soon spill over into Asia.	同样的问题可能很快也会在亚洲出现。
Until recently, China, Japan, and others in Asia have staunchly defended the requirement that the Security Council approve any outside military intervention in sovereign states.	到目前为止，中国、日本和其他亚洲国家都坚定地捍卫了任何对外部主权国家军事干预需要安理会批准的要求。
Recently, however, several countries in East Asia have become locked in a spiral of claims and counterclaims regarding borders, shipping lanes, and territorial rights.	但是，最近一些东亚国家陷入了关于边界、航路和领土权利的主张和反制循环。
So far, these disputes have remained basically peaceful, but tensions are rising.	到目前为止，这些纠纷基本上是和平的，但紧张态势在升级。
We must hope that the countries of the region continue to see the great value of international law as a bulwark of sovereignty, and act accordingly.	我们必然希望该地区的国家依然珍视国际法作为主权保护屏障的巨大价值并遵守国际法。
There have long been skeptics of international law – those who believe that it can never prevail over the national interests of major powers, and that maintaining a balance of power among competitors is all that really can be done to keep the peace.	对国际法的怀疑由来已久 — — 有些人认为国际法永远无法凌驾于大国的国家利益之上，维持竞争对手间的实力平衡才是维持和平唯一可行的办法。
From this perspective, Russia’s actions in the Crimea are simply the actions of a great power asserting its prerogatives.	从这个角度讲，俄罗斯在克里米亚的行为只不过是强国在主张其特权。
Yet such a world is profoundly and unnecessarily dangerous.	但这样的世界是极其危险的，也根本无须如此。
We have learned time and again that there is no such thing as a true “balance of power.”	我们一再看到，没有真正的所谓“实力平衡 ” 。
There are always imbalances and destabilizing power shifts.	失衡和破坏性实力变迁才是永恒。
Without some scaffolding of law, open conflict is all too likely.	没有法律的约束，开放冲突随时都会发生。
This is especially true today, as countries jostle for oil and other vital resources.	今天尤其如此，各国正在争相攫取石油和其他关键资源。
It is no coincidence that most of the deadly wars of recent years have taken place in regions rich in valuable and contested natural resources.	近几年来，大部分伤亡惨重的战争都发生在富于宝贵和稀缺自然资源的地区，这不是巧合。
As we look back in this centennial year toward the outbreak of WWI, we see again and again that the only possible route to safety is international law, upheld by the United Nations and respected on all sides.	今年是一战爆发一百周年纪念，回顾历史，我们一再看到，唯一可能的安全之路只有受联合国支持和各方尊重的国际法。
Yes, it sounds naive, but no one has to look back to see the naiveté of the belief that great-power politics will preserve peace and ensure humanity’s survival.	是的，这听起来相当天真，但回顾历史，认为大国政治能维持和平、确保人类生存才是真的天真。
In the Ukraine crisis, the Security Council should help to find a negotiated solution that preserves Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.	在乌克兰危机中，安理会应该促进找出能保全乌克兰主权和领土完整的谈判解决方案。
That will not happen soon, but the UN should persevere, looking for a breakthrough at a later date.	这不可能马上到来，但联合国应该坚持不懈，力争在晚些时候取得突破。
And, just as the US turns to the Security Council in this case, so it should hold itself accountable to international law as well, helping to build a bulwark against dangerous global instability.	而正如美国在这场危机中回归安理会，它也应该让自己接受国际法的束缚，帮助建立防止危险的全球动荡的框架。
	
Deep Decarbonization	深度脱碳
NEW YORK – Have a look at what happened around the world this past month.	纽约—看看世界在即将过去的一个月中发生了什么。
Australia’s heat wave filled headlines when temperatures reaching 45° Celsius disrupted the Australian Open tennis tournament.	澳大利亚45℃的热浪上了新闻，甚至影响了澳大利亚网球公开赛。
California’s extreme drought forced the governor to declare a state of emergency.	加州极度干旱迫使州长宣布进入紧急状态。
Major floods in Indonesia killed dozens and displaced tens of thousands.	印尼大洪水夺走了几十人的生命，并导致数万人流离失所。
Beijing’s coal-induced smog forced people to stay in their homes, closed highways, and diverted flights.	北京煤炭引起的雾霾迫使人们不敢外出、高速公路关闭、航班延误。
Such events are daily warnings to the world: wake up before it is too late.	这些事件无不在警告世界：再不警醒，悔之晚矣。
We have entered the Age of Sustainable Development.	我们已经进入可持续发展时代。
Either we make peace with the planet, or we destroy our hard-won prosperity.	要么与地球和平共处，要么摧毁得之不易的繁荣。
The choice seems obvious, but our actions speak louder than words. Humanity continues on a path of ruin, driven by short-term greed and ignorance.	选择似乎是毫无疑问的，但所谓行胜于言，人类仍走在破坏的道路上，其背后的推动力是短期贪婪和无知。
Much (though not all) of the global environmental crisis stems from the world’s fossil-fuel-based energy system.	许多（尽管不是全部）全球环境危机来自以化石燃料为基础的世界能源体系。
More than 80% of all primary energy in the world comes from coal, oil, and gas.	全世界80%以上的初级能源来自煤炭、石油和天然气。
When these fossil fuels are burned, they emit carbon dioxide, which in turn changes the Earth’s climate.	当这些化石燃料燃烧时，会释放二氧化碳，而二氧化碳会改变地球的气候。
The basic physics has been known for more than a century.	其中的物理学原理我们一个世纪前就已经知晓了。
Unfortunately, a few oil companies (ExxonMobil and Koch Industries are the most notorious) have devoted enormous resources to sowing confusion even where there is clear scientific consensus.	不幸的是，一小撮石油公司（埃克森美孚和柯氏工业集团（Koch Industries）是其中最臭名昭著者）花大力气混淆视听，哪怕科学界早已形成了共识。
But, in order to save the planet we know, and to preserve the world’s food supply and the well-being of future generations, there is no alternative to shifting to a new, low-carbon energy system.	但是，为了拯救我们所熟悉的地球、保证世界粮食供应和子孙后代的福利，我们只有切换到新的低碳能源体系一途可走。
There are three parts to this transition.	这一转变有三个部分。
The first is improved energy efficiency, meaning that we should use much less energy to achieve the same level of well-being.	首先是改善能源效率，这意味着我们可以使用少得多的能源实现相同水平的福利。
For example, we can design our buildings to use sunlight and natural-air circulation so that they require far less commercial energy for heating, cooling, and ventilation.	比如，我们可以设计利用阳光和天然空气循环的建筑，这样就可以使用少得多的商业能源用于制热、制冷和通风。
Second, we need to shift to solar, wind, hydro, nuclear, geothermal, and other forms of energy that are not based on fossil fuels.	其次，我们需要转向太阳能、风能、水能、核能、地热能和其他形式的不基于化石燃料的能源。
The technology exists to use these alternatives safely, affordably, and at a scale large enough to replace almost all of the coal, and much of the oil, that we use today.	我们已经用了技术可以以安全、廉价和足够大的规模使用这些替代能源取代几乎所有我们现在所使用的煤炭和大部分的石油。
Only natural gas (the cleanest-burning fossil fuel) would remain a significant source of energy by mid-century.	只有天然气（最清洁的化石燃料）将继续充当主要能源来源直到本世纪中叶。
Finally, to the extent that we continue to rely on fossil fuels, we must capture the resulting CO2 emissions at power plants before they escape into the atmosphere.	最后，由于我们要继续依赖化石燃料，因此我们必须捕捉发电厂产生的二氧化碳而不让它们逃逸到大气中。
The captured CO2 would then be injected underground or under the ocean floor for safe long-term storage.	捕捉到的二氧化碳可以注入地下或海地，做长期的安全储藏。
Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is already being used successfully on a very small scale (mainly to enhance oil recovery in depleted wells).	碳捕捉和隔离（CCS）已经实现了相当小规模的成功应用（主要用于枯竭油井的油气回收 ） 。
If (and only if) it proves successful for large-scale use, coal-dependent countries like China, India, and the United States could continue to use their reserves.	当（且仅当）CCS可以成功地得到大规模应用时，中国、印度和美国等依赖煤炭的国家便（才）可以继续使用它们的储量。
American politicians have proved to be incapable of designing policies to shift the US to low-carbon energy use.	美国政客证明他们在设计让美国转向低碳能源使用方面的政策上十分无能。
Such policies would include a rising tax on CO2 emissions, large-scale research-and-development efforts in low-carbon technologies, a shift to electric vehicles, and regulations to phase out all coal-fired power plants except those that install CCS.	这些政策应该包括提高二氧化碳排放税、大规模低碳技术研发、推广电动汽车以及通过监管取缔纯火电厂（除非它们采用了CCS ） 。
Yet politicians are pursuing none of these policies adequately.	但政客在所有这些政策上都没有充分的作为。
Climate-change foes have spent billions of dollars to influence policymakers, support election campaigns by defenders of fossil fuels, and defeat candidates who dare to promote clean energy.	气候变化的生产者花了数十亿美元影响决策者、支持化石燃料捍卫者的竞选活动、拆敢于推广清洁能源的候选人的台。
The Republican Party as a whole attracts massive financial support from opponents of decarbonization, and these donors aggressively fight even the smallest step toward renewable energy.	总体而言，共和党获得了来自脱碳反对派的巨额金融支持，这些赞助者积极地与哪怕是最微小的迈向可再生能源的步伐做着斗争。
For their part, many Democratic members of the US Congress are also in the pro-fossil-fuel camp.	美国国会中的很多民主党议员和站在亲化石燃料阵营。
A few big players in the energy industry, showing no concern for truth (much less for our children, who will bear the consequences of our present folly), have teamed up with Rupert Murdoch.	能源业的一些巨头无视事实（更不为我们的孩子们考虑，他们将承担我们现在的荒唐行为的后果 ） ， 与鲁珀特·默多克（Rupert Murdoch）勾结在一起。
Indeed, Murdoch, the Koch Brothers, and their allies behave just like Big Tobacco in denying scientific truths; even use the same experts for hire.	事实上，默多克、柯氏兄弟和他们的盟友在否认科学事实方面与大烟草公司是一丘之貉，甚至他们聘请的专家都是同一批人。
The situation is generally the same around the world.	全世界面临的局面总体上是一样的。
Wherever powerful lobbies defend existing coal or oil interests, politicians typically are afraid to tell the truth about the need for low-carbon energy.	在权势游说集团捍卫现有煤炭和石油利益的地方，政客通常不敢告诉人民需要低碳能源的真相。
Brave politicians who do tell the truth about climate change are found mainly in countries that do not have a powerful fossil-fuel lobby.	勇敢说出气候变化真相的政客往往存在于不存在权势化石燃料游说集团的国家。
Consider the fate of one courageous exception to this rule.	以这一规则的一个勇敢的挑战者的命运为例。
Kevin Rudd, the former Australian prime minister, tried to implement a clean-energy policy in his coal-producing country.	澳大利亚前总理陆克文试图实施一项清洁能源政策。 而他的国家是一个产煤国。
Rudd was defeated in his re-election bid by a candidate whose backing from an alliance of Murdoch and coal companies enabled him to outspend Rudd by a huge margin.	陆克文在连任竞争中败给了一位背后有默多克和煤炭公司支持的候选人。 后两者的支持让他以压倒性优势战胜了陆克文。
Murdoch’s tabloids pump out anti-scientific propaganda opposing climate-change policies not only in Australia, but also in the US and elsewhere.	默多克旗下的报纸大量灌输反对气候变化政策的反科学宣传，不仅在澳大利亚如此，在美国和其他国家也如此。
The reason all of this matters is that the path to deep decarbonization is open to us.	所有这些之所以事关重大，是因为深度脱碳之路是一条开放之路。
Yet time is very short.	但时间不等人。
The world needs to stop building new coal-fired power plants (except those that implement CCS) and to shift to low-carbon electricity.	世界必须停止建设新的火电厂（除非采取CCS）并转向低碳电能。
It needs to phase out the internal combustion engine for almost all new passenger vehicles by around 2030, shifting to vehicles powered by electricity.	世界必须在2030年左右彻底淘汰使用内燃机的新造乘用车，采用电动汽车。
And it needs to adopt energy-saving technologies that consume less commercial energy.	世界还必须采取能源节约技术以更少地使用商业能源。
The technologies are available and will get better and cheaper with use, if only fossil-fuel lobbies can be held at bay.	技术已经存在，并将变得更出色、更廉价，要是能成功抵制化石燃料游说集团就更好了。
If this happens, people around the world will discover something wonderful.	果真如此的话，全世界人民将会发现美好的新事物。
Not only will they have saved the planet for the next generation; they will also enjoy sunshine and clean, healthy air.	他们不但为下一代挽救了地球；还享受到了阳光和清洁健康的空气。
And they will ask what took so long when the Earth itself was at dire risk.	他们会问，在地球岌岌可危时，是什么让人们拖延了这么久才采取行动。
	
Let the Middle East Govern Itself	让中东自治
NEW YORK – It is time for the United States and other powers to let the Middle East govern itself in line with national sovereignty and the United Nations Charter.	纽约—美国和其他强国应该让中东根据国家主权和《联合国宪章》自治（govern itself）了。
As the US contemplates yet another round of military action in Iraq and intervention in Syria, it should recognize two basic truths.	美国正在考虑新一轮伊拉克军事行动和叙利亚干预，眼下它应该认识到两大基本事实。
First, US interventions, which have cost the country trillions of dollars and thousands of lives over the past decade, have consistently destabilized the Middle East, while causing massive suffering in the affected countries.	首先，美国的干预在过去十年里耗费了数万亿美元和数千条人命，却一直在动摇中东，给受影响国家造成了巨大灾难。
Second, the region’s governments – in Syria, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, and elsewhere – have both the incentive and the means to reach mutual accommodations.	其次，该地区的各国政府 — — 叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯、土耳其、伊朗、伊拉克、埃及等 — — 有动力也有办法达成互相妥协。
What is stopping them is the belief that the US or some other outside power (such as Russia) will deliver a decisive victory on their behalf.	让它们无法达成妥协的是这样一种观点：美国或其他外部势力（如俄罗斯）会代表它们带来决定性胜利。
When the Ottoman Empire collapsed at the end of World War I, the great powers of the day, Britain and France, carved out successor states in order to ensure their control over the Middle East’s oil, geopolitics, and transit routes to Asia.	一战结束，奥斯曼帝国崩溃，当时的列强英国和法国根据它们控制中东石油、地缘政治和至亚洲运输线路的需要划分新的国家。
Their cynicism – reflected, for example, in the Sykes-Picot Agreement – established a lasting pattern of destructive outside meddling.	它们的猜忌 — — 体现于赛克斯-皮科协定（Sykes-Picot Agreement）中 — — 造成了持续不断的破坏性外部干预。
With America’s subsequent emergence as a global power, it treated the Middle East in the same way, relentlessly installing, toppling, bribing, or manipulating the region’s governments, all the while mouthing democratic rhetoric.	随后美国崛起成为超级大国，它对待中东的方式并未改变，鲁莽地扶持、颠覆、贿赂或操纵地区各国政府，每一次都打折民主的口号。
For example, less than two years after Iran’s democratically elected parliament and prime minister, Mohammad Mossadegh, nationalized the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in 1951, the US and Britain used their secret services to topple Mossadegh and install the incompetent, violent, and authoritarian Shah Reza Pahlavi.	比如，1951年，在通过民主选举成为伊朗总理不到两年的摩萨德（Mohammad Mossadegh）对盎格鲁-伊朗石油公司（Anglo-Iranian Oil Company）实施了国有化，结果美国和英国通过秘密特工颠覆了摩萨德，扶持了一个拙劣、暴力、极权的巴拉维（Shah Reza Pahlav ） 。
Not surprisingly, the Islamic Revolution that overthrew the Shah in 1979 brought a wave of virulent anti-Americanism in its wake.	毫不奇怪，1979年推翻巴拉维的伊斯兰革命掀起了一股致命的反美旋风。
Rather than seeking rapprochement, however, the US supported Saddam Hussein during Iraq’s eight-year war with Iran in the 1980s.	但是，美国并没有寻求重建外交关系，而是在20世纪80年代伊拉克与伊朗的八年战争中支持了萨达姆。
Iraq fared no better with the British and Americans.	伊拉克与英国和美国的关系也并不比伊朗融洽。
Britain ruthlessly created a subservient Iraqi state after WWI, backing Sunni elites to control the majority Shia population.	一战后，英国残酷地建立了顺从的伊拉克国，支持逊尼派精英控制占多数的什叶派人口。
After oil was discovered in the 1920s, Britain assumed control over the new oil fields, using military force as needed.	20世纪20年代石油被发现后，英国又控制了仅有的几个油田，必要时甚至不惜动用武力。
The US supported the 1968 coup that brought the Ba’ath Party – and Saddam – to power.	在美国的支持下，1968年复兴党（Ba���ath Party）和萨达姆通过政变问鼎权力。
With Saddam’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990, however, the US turned on him, and has been entwined in Iraq’s politics ever since, including two wars, sanction regimes, the toppling of Saddam in 2003, and repeated attempts, as recently as this month, to install a government that it considered acceptable.	但是，1990年萨达姆入侵科威特后，美国又把枪口对准了他，并且越来越深地干预伊拉克政治，包括发动两场战争、制裁伊拉克政府、2003年推翻萨达姆以及反复尝试（如这个月所发生的事情所证明的）扶持它认为可接受的政府。
The result has been an unmitigated catastrophe: the destruction of Iraq as a functioning society in an ongoing civil war, fueled by outside powers, that has caused economic ruin and collapsing living standards.	结果造成了彻头彻尾的灾难：外部势力煽风点火的持续内战破坏了经济，大大打击了生活水平，伊拉克社会功能被彻底摧毁。
Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have died in the violence since 1990.	1990年以来，数十万伊拉克人死于暴力。
Syria endured decades of French dominance after WWI, and then alternatingly hot and cold relations with the US and Europe since the 1960s.	在一战后的几十年里，叙利亚一直由法国主宰，随后，自20世纪60年代以来，与美国和欧洲保持着时冷时热的关系。
During the past decade, the US and its allies have tried to weaken, and then, starting in 2011, to topple President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, mainly in a proxy war to undermine Iranian influence in Syria.	在过去十年中，美国及其盟友试图削弱总统巴沙尔·阿萨德政权，从2011年开始更是试图推翻他，主要方式是通过代理战争破坏伊朗对叙利亚的影响。
The results have been devastating for the Syrian people.	结果是叙利亚人民都灾难。
Assad remains in power, but more than 190,000 Syrians are dead and millions have been displaced as a result of an insurrection supported by the US and its allies (with Assad backed by Russia and Iran).	巴沙尔仍在掌权，但190,000多叙利亚人因为美国及其盟友所支持的暴乱（针对俄罗斯和伊朗所支持的巴沙尔）失去了生命，更有数百万人流离失所。
Some US officials are now reportedly considering an alliance with Assad to fight the militant Islamic State, whose rise was enabled by the US-backed insurrection.	据说一些美国官员现在正在考虑与巴沙尔结盟与伊斯兰国进行军事对抗，而后者的崛起正是拜美国所支持的暴乱所赐。
After decades of cynical and often secret interventions by the US, Britain, France, Russia, and other outside powers, the region’s political institutions are based largely on corruption, sectarian politics, and brute force.	在经历了几十年来自美国、英国、法国、俄罗斯和其他外部势力自私并且通常是秘密的干预后，该地区的政治制度可以说是建立在腐败、宗派政治和野蛮武力的基础上。
Yet whenever a new Middle East crisis erupts, the latest being triggered by the Islamic State’s recent gains, the US intervenes again, perhaps to change a government (as it has just orchestrated in Iraq) or to launch a new bombing assault.	但每当新的中东危机爆发时 — — 最新的例子是伊斯兰国的狂飙突进 — — 美国就会再次干预，或者是改变政府（如刚刚在伊拉克所导演的 ） ， 或者是发动新一轮轰炸袭击。
Backroom dealings and violence continue to rule the day.	幕后交易和暴力仍是日常规则。
Pundits claim that Arabs cannot manage democracy.	专家们说，阿拉伯人没有能力管理民主。
In fact, the US and its allies simply don’t like the results of Arab democracy, which all too often produces governments that are nationalist, anti-Israel, Islamist, and dangerous to America’s oil interests.	事实上，美国及其盟友根本不喜欢阿拉伯民主的结果 — — 通常产生民族主义、反以色列、伊斯兰教的政府，并对美国石油利益构成威胁。
When the ballots go in that direction, the US simply ignores the election results (as it did, for example, in 2006, when Hamas won a large majority of the popular vote in Gaza).	当选举形势向这方面发展时，美国就会无视选举结果（比如，2006年哈马斯赢得加沙民选大胜时就是如此 ） 。
The US cannot stop the spiral of violence in the Middle East.	美国无法结束中东的暴力循环。
The damage in Libya, Gaza, Syria, and Iraq demands that a political solution be found within the region, not imposed from the outside.	利比亚、加沙、叙利亚和伊拉克的破坏需要在该地区内部寻找政治解决方案，而不是由外部强加。
The UN Security Council should provide an international framework in which the major powers pull back, lift crippling economic sanctions, and abide by political agreements reached by the region’s own governments and factions.	联合国安理会应该提供一个国际框架让主要大国写上，取消后果严重的经济制裁，并遵守该地区各国政府和各派系之间自身达成的政治协议。
Iran, Turkey, Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and other neighbors know one another well enough – thanks to 2,000-plus years of trade and war – to sort out the pieces themselves, without interference from the US, Russia, and the former colonial powers of Europe.	伊朗、土耳其、埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯、阿联酋和其他邻国十分了解彼此 — — 这是2,000多年贸易和战争史的结果 — — 足以自力更生走出残局，不需要劳烦美国、俄罗斯和欧洲的其他前殖民国家。
The countries of the Middle East have a common interest in starving hyper-violent groups like the Islamic State of arms, money, and media attention.	中东各国有着共同利益切断伊斯兰国等极端暴力组织的武器、资金和媒体关注。
They also share an interest in keeping oil flowing to world markets – and in capturing the bulk of the revenues.	它们也有着共同利益让石油流向世界市场，并获得其中的大部分收入。
I am not claiming that all will be well if the US and other powers pull back.	我并不是说美国和其他强国一走了之就万事大吉。
There is enough hatred, corruption, and arms in the region to keep it in crisis for years to come.	中东地区存在着大量的仇恨、腐败和武器，足以在多年时间里让该地区处于危机状态。
And nobody should expect stable democracies any time soon.	没有人可以期待很快就会出现稳定的民主。
But lasting solutions will not be found as long as the US and other foreign powers continue to meddle in the region.	但只要美国和其他外部势力继续在中东搅局，就无法形成持久的解决方案。
One hundred years after the start of WWI, colonial practices must finally come to an end.	一战爆发已经过去了一个世纪，殖民主义行为必须结束。
The Middle East needs the opportunity to govern itself, protected and supported by the UN Charter, not by any individual great power.	中东需要自治的机会，并且这一机会应该得到《联合国宪章》而不是某个超级大国的保护和支持。
	
Our Last Chance for a Safe Planet	拯救地球的最后机会
MELBOURNE – Humanity has just about run out of time to address climate change.	墨尔本—人类再不解决气候变化问题就快没有时间了。
Scientists have pointed out that a rise in temperature of 2º Celsius above pre-industrial levels will put the Earth in dangerous, uncharted territory.	科学家指出，如若气温较前工业化水平升高2℃，地球就将进入前所未知的危险状态。
Yet we currently are on a path toward an increase of 4º or more this century.	但照现在的势头，到本世纪末气温将上升4℃。
The last chance for action has arrived.	我们面临着采取行动的最后机会。
That chance lies in Paris in December 2015, when the world’s governments meet for the 21st annual United Nations climate-change meeting.	这一机会就在2015年的巴黎，世界各国政府将在此召开第21届联合国气候变化年会。
But this time will be different.	但这次年会有所不同。
Either governments will agree to decisive action, as they have promised, or we will look back at 2015 as the year when climate sanity slipped through our fingers.	各国政府必须如承诺的那样同意采取果断行动，否则从未来回头望，2015年将是我们彻底丧失清醒的气候意识之年。
In 1992, the world’s governments adopted the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, promising to avoid “dangerous anthropogenic [human-induced] interference in the climate system” by reducing the rate of emission of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide.	1992年，世界政府通过了联合国气候变化框架公约（UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ） ， 承诺通过削减温室气体特别是二氧化碳排放避免“对气候系统的危险的人为干预 ” 。
But, though the treaty entered into force in 1994, the rate of emissions of greenhouse gases, including CO2, has actually increased.	但是，尽管该条约从1994年开始生效，但温室气体包括二氧化碳的排放速度实际上有所增加。
In 1992, global combustion of coal, oil, and gas, plus cement production, released 22.6 billion tons of CO2 into the air.	1992年，全��煤炭、石油和天然气燃烧加上水泥生产总共向大气中释放了226亿吨二氧化碳。
In 2012, the most recent year for which comparable data are available, emissions were 34.5 billion tons.	2012年（可获得可比数据的最近年份 ） ， 排放量是345亿吨。
Humanity has accelerated, rather than controlled, human-induced climate change.	人类正在加速而不是控制人为气候变化。
This is now the greatest moral issue of our time.	这就是现时代的道德大问题。
Global fossil-fuel use gravely threatens the poor, who are the most vulnerable to climate change (though the rich are the main cause), and future generations, who will inherit a planet that has become unlivable in many places, with food supply subject to massive shocks.	全球化石燃料使用大大地威胁到穷人（他们是最易受气候变化影响的群体，尽管富人才是引起气候变化的主因）和子孙后代（他们将继承一个许多地方不再适合居住的地球，粮食供应也将受到巨大冲击 ） 。
We are causing this harm in an age when technological breakthroughs enable the world to shift from dangerous fossil fuels to low-carbon energy sources, such as wind, solar, nuclear, and hydro, and reduce the impact of fossil fuels by using carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology.	而在造成这一伤害的同一时代，科技突破使世界能够从危险的化石燃料转向低碳能源资源，如风能、太阳能、核能和水能，并且通过碳捕捉和存储（CCS）技术减少化石燃料的影响。
Pope Francis recently put it just right: “Safeguard Creation,” he said. “Because if we destroy Creation, Creation will destroy us!	方济各教皇最近正确地指出 ： “ 捍卫造化 ， ” 他说 ， “ 因为如果我们摧毁造化，造化也会摧毁我们！
Never forget this!”	切记切记 ！ ”
Yet, for the many powerful interests, climate change remains a game, with the goal being to delay action for as long as possible.	但是，对许多强大的既得利益而言，气候变化仍然是一场博弈，目标是尽可能推迟行动。
The giant fossil-fuel companies have continued to lobby behind the scenes against the shift to low-carbon energy, and have used their vast wealth to buy media coverage designed to sow confusion.	化石燃料巨头公司继续在幕后游说阻止转向低碳能源，并利用巨大的财力收买媒体混淆视听。
Rupert Murdoch’s media empire in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and elsewhere stands out as playing a particularly cynical and harmful role in spreading anti-scientific propaganda.	在美国、英国、澳大利亚和其他地方，鲁珀特·默多克（Rupert Murdoch）的媒体帝国充当着传播反科学宣传的急先锋。
Even so, the politics of climate change may be changing for the better – a change reflected in the Pope’s forceful message.	尽管如此，气候变化的政治仍可能在向好的方向发展 — — 教皇的训令即是明证。
Here are six reasons why the stalemate might soon end.	有六大理由可以认为停滞不前的状态马上就会结束。
First, the world is waking up to the calamity that we are causing.	首先，世界正在警醒我们正在造成的灾难。
Though the Murdoch propaganda machine churns out a daily stream of anti-scientific falsehoods, the public also sees prolonged droughts (now in parts of Brazil, California, and Southeast Asia, to name a few places), massive floods (recently in Bosnia and Serbia), and lethal heat waves (in many parts of the world).	尽管默多克的宣传机器每天都在炮制反科学谎言，但公众也目睹了挥之不去的旱灾（目前正在巴西、加州、东南亚等地区肆虐 ） 、 大洪水（波斯尼亚和塞尔维亚）和致命热浪（世界多地 ） 。
Second, the world’s citizens do not want to go down in flames.	其次，世界人民不希望看到地球毁灭。
Public opinion has so far succeeded in blocking the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would accelerate the production of Canada’s oil sands – a shocking prospect, given that neither Canada nor the US yet have committed to a climate plan.	民意已成功地抵制了加速加拿大油砂生产的Keystone XL管道 — — 该项目是十分危险的，因为加拿大和美国都没有做出气候计划承诺。
Third, more severe climate shocks may lie ahead.	第三，更严重的气候冲击摆在我们面前。
This year could prove to be a major El Niño year, when the waters of the Eastern Pacific warm and create global climate disruptions.	今年可能是厄尔尼诺之年，东太平洋的海水会升温，造成全球气候扰动。
A big El Niño now would be even more dangerous than usual, because it would add to the overall rising trend in global temperatures.	如今，大型厄尔尼诺现象的危害将比以往更甚，因为这会进一步加剧全球气温升高的总体趋势。
Indeed, many scientists believe that a big El Niño could make 2015 the hottest year in the Earth’s history.	事实上，许多科学家认为大型厄尔尼诺现象将让2015年成为地球历史上最热的年份。
Fourth, both the US and China, the two largest emitters of CO2, are finally beginning to get serious.	第四，最大的两个二氧化碳排放国 — — 美国和中国最终开始认真对待这一问题。
President Barack Obama’s administration is trying to stop the construction of new coal-fired power plants, unless they are equipped with CCS technology.	奥巴马总统政府试图停滞新煤电站的建设，除非采用CCS技术。
China, for its part, has realized that its heavy dependence on coal is causing such devastating pollution and smog that it is leading to massive loss of life, with life expectancy down as much as five years in regions with heavy coal consumption.	中国也认识到其对煤炭的严重依赖正在造成了能导致重大生命损失的灾难性的污染和雾霾，主要煤炭消费地区预期寿命将下降五年之多。
Fifth, the Paris negotiations are finally beginning to attract global attention from both the public and world leaders.	第五，巴黎谈判终于开始吸引包括公众和世界领袖在内的全球目光。
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for political leaders to attend a special summit in September 2014, 14 months ahead of the Paris meeting, to launch intensive negotiations.	联合国秘书长潘基文呼吁政治领导人出席2014年9月（巴黎会议前14个月）举行的特别峰会，开战密集谈判。
The UN expert network that I direct, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (UN SDSN), will issue a major report in July on how each of the major economies can successfully decarbonize the energy system.	由我牵头的联合国专家网络 — — 可持续发展方案网络（Sustainable Development Solutions Network）将在7月发布重要报告，指出各主要经济体应如何实现能源体系的去碳化。
Finally, technological advances in low-carbon energy systems, including photovoltaics, electric vehicles, CCS, and fourth-generation nuclear power with greatly enhanced safety features, all help make the transition to low-cost, low-carbon energy technologically realistic, with huge benefits for human health and planetary safety.	最后，低碳能源体系的技术进步，包括光伏电池、电动汽车、CCS和安全性能显著增强的第四代核电，都有助于实现向低成本、低碳能源技术的转型，人类健康和地球安全将大受裨益。
Starting this fall, the UN SDSN will create a platform for all global citizens to participate in the hard work of saving the planet.	从今年秋季开始，联合国SDSN将打造一个平台方便全体地球公民参与拯救地球的艰巨事业中。
The SDSN will offer a free, online introductory course to climate change, and then host a global online “negotiation” of a global climate agreement.	SDSN将提供免费的在线介课程介绍气候变化，并组织全球气候协议的全球在线“谈判 ” 。
We expect that hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of interested citizens worldwide will participate online, showing the way for the politicians.	我们期待能有几十万甚至几百万有兴趣的世界公民在线参与，向政客表达民意。
The control of climate change is a moral imperative and a practical necessity – far too important to be left to politicians, Big Oil, and their media propagandists.	控制气候变化既是道德需求，也是现实必要 — — 这个重要任务不能只由政客、石油巨头及其媒体宣传机器参与。
	
The Oligarchy Fallacy	寡头政治的谬误
CAMBRIDGE – Income inequality has received a lot of attention lately, particularly in two arenas where it previously received little: American public debate and the International Monetary Fund.	坎布里奇 — — 近来尤其在美国公众辩论和国际货币基金组织这两个以往关注较少的领域，收入不平等现象已经引起了人们的普遍关注。
A major reason is concern in the United States that income inequality has returned to Gilded Age extremes; but inequality has increased in many other parts of the world as well, and remains high in Latin America.	人们担忧的主要原因是美国的收入不平等已经回到了镀金时代的极端状况；但是在世界其他国家不平等现象愈演愈烈的同时，拉美的不平等依然没有缓和的迹象。
What have we learned so far?	到目前为止我们吸取了哪些教训？
Perhaps what is most interesting about the current discussion is that much of the focus has been on the consequences of inequality beyond its adverse effect on the welfare of the poor.	或许目前讨论中最有趣的一点是人们最看重不平等在穷人福祉以外的负面效果。
One such avenue of debate starts from the hypothesis that inequality is bad for overall economic growth.	辩论的焦点之一是假设不平等不利于总体经济增长。
Another begins with the view that inequality leads to volatility and instability.	另一个焦点是不平等破坏稳定，导致经济出现动荡。
Did inequality cause, for example, the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007 and hence the global financial crisis of 2008?	比方说，不平等究竟是不是2007年次贷危机和2008年全球金融危机的幕后推手？
A third proposition is that inequality translates into envy and unhappiness: someone who would have been happy at a given income is unhappy if he discovers that others are getting more.	另一个命题是不平等转化为嫉妒和不满：特定收入水平的人本来可能很高兴，但当他们发现别人拿得更多时高兴却变成了不满。
A persuasive version of this claim holds that top executives demand and receive outlandish compensation not because they value the money so much, but because they compete with each other for status.	一种颇具说服力的观点认为高管对薪酬的离谱要求并非因为他们那么看重钱，而是为了地位而相互争斗。
A fourth concern appears to trump even the first three.	最重要的莫过于第四种担忧。
It is the fear that, because there is so much money in politics, the rich succeed in persuading governments to adopt policies that favor them as a class.	人们担心因为金钱在政界的作用越来越大，富人有能力说服政府采取偏袒其所在阶层的政策。
Whereas the first three sources of concern are amenable to self-correction, at least in a democracy, the concentration of economic and political power in an oligarchy is self-reinforcing.	虽然至少民主国家有能力在一定程度上对前三个问题进行自我修正，但寡头体制下经济和政治权力的集中趋势却能够自我强化。
In the US, recent Supreme Court decisions regarding campaign contributions suggest that the influence of money in politics will only grow.	美国最高法院有关政治献金案的最新裁决表明金钱对政治的影响力只会越来越大。
But pursuing the anti-oligarchy argument is not the best way to reduce inequality.	但坚持反寡头论并非控制不平等的最好方法。
Rather, we should work from the premise that poverty in particular, and inequality in general, is simply undesirable.	我们的出发点应当是贫困和一般意义上的不平等根本是不可取的。
Even in the US, most voters care about inequality, and even among the top 1%, approximately two-thirds believe that income differences are too large and support progressive taxation.	美国多数选民也关注不平等，甚至就连排名前1%的富人有三分之二也认为收入差距过大并支持累进税制。
Most Americans believe in helping the less fortunate, provided that it can be accomplished without undermining economic efficiency through excessive government intervention or distortion of incentives.	只要不因为政府过度干预破坏经济效率或改变激励原则，绝大多数美国人都相信应该对不幸群体施以援手。
The problem is that, despite their economic self-interest, voters often elect, and reelect, politicians who enact laws that are inconsistent with such goals.	问题在于虽然有悖于自身经济利益，但选民却往往会一再选出制定有悖于上述目标法律的政治家。
Ten years ago, for example, America’s elected leaders somehow hoodwinked the median US voter – who is most likely to leave little to his or her heirs – into believing that it was necessary to eliminate taxes on $5 million estates in order to protect small family-owned farms.	比如10年前，美国的当选领导人不知采用何种手段蒙蔽了美国最可能没有遗产留给子女的中间选民，让他们相信必须取消5亿房地产税才能保护家庭小型农场。
In other words, the problem is not that the median voter is unwilling to trade off growth in exchange for more equality.	换句话说，问题并不是中间选民不愿牺牲增长换取更多平等。
The problem is that the political process produces outcomes that deliver both less growth and less equality.	问题在于政治进程产生出既牺牲增长又影响平等的结果。
For the US, the most sensible measures include expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), elimination of payroll taxes for low-income workers, a cut in deductions for high-income taxpayers, and restoration of higher inheritance taxes.	具体到美国而言，最明智的措施包括扩大实施劳动收入税收抵免政策（EITC ） 、 取消对低收入工人征收工资税、减少对高收入纳税者的税收减免及恢复较高额度的遗产税征收。
These are policies that reduce inequality efficiently, at relatively low cost to aggregate income.	上述政策能有效缩短贫富差距，同时对总收入的影响也相对较小。
Other policies – including universal pre-school education and universal health care – may even promote overall economic growth while reducing inequality, especially if they are financed by efficiency-enhancing measures such as the elimination of fossil-fuel subsidies (and, preferably, their replacement with a tax).	尤其如果同时采取取消化石燃料补贴（最好能以某种税收取代）等提高效率的举措，包括普及型学前教育和普及型医保在内的其他政策或许甚至能在缓和不平等的同时促进总体经济增长。
Meanwhile, many government programs that are billed as ways to improve income distribution benefit the poor relatively little and impair economic efficiency.	此外，许多被标榜为改善收入分配的计划不仅有损于经济效率，而且也让穷人受益极少。
The original rationale for agricultural subsidies was largely to help small farmers, but the main beneficiary has long been agribusiness.	农业补贴的最初理念主要是扶助小型农户，但农业综合企业却一向是上述政策的主要受益者。
Mortgage subsidies contributed to the subprime loan crisis, without even primarily helping lower-income families.	按揭补贴催生了次贷危机，但其甚至不是以帮助低收入家庭为主要目的的。
And yet many Americans are persuaded to support such policies, not because it is in their interest, but because they do not understand the economics.	但很多美国人都被说服支持这样的政策，并不是因为这样做符合他们的利益，而是因为他们对经济问题不甚明了。
Other countries have similar programs that are sold as pro-equality but are inefficient or even undermine their stated goal.	其他国家也存在类似打着平等幌子的政策，但实际不仅效率低下，甚至有损于既定目标。
In developing countries, distortionary measures that tax, subsidize, or regulate food and energy prices tend to be poor tools for improving income distribution, and frequently have the opposite effect.	发展中国家扭曲的税收、补贴或食品及能源价格监管政策往往对改善收入分配不太有效，并且往往产生相反的效果。
Of the more than $400 billion that countries spend on fossil fuel subsidies each year, for example, far less than 20% of the benefits go to the poorest 20% of the population.	举例来讲，在各国每年花在化石燃料补贴上的4000多亿美元中，只有远低于20%的份额最终能被最贫困的20%人口享受到。
A disproportionately small share of social spending goes to the poorest 40%.	最贫困的40%人口享受到的社会支出同样低得不成比例。
Conditional cash transfers, on the other hand, have proven highly effective; they reach the poor while promoting education and health.	另一方面，事实证明有条件转移支付非常有效；它们能够惠及穷人，同时改善教育和医疗状况。
The anti-oligarchy argument claim is that the rich have too much money, which they use to elect politicians who will enact laws that favor their interests.	反寡头政治论主张富人太过有钱，他们会用这些钱选出制定法律照顾其自身利益的政客。
But it seems better to argue about the best policies to improve income distribution efficiently, and to point out which politicians support them.	但我认为探讨有效改善收入分配的政策、并指出哪些政客支持这些政策其实效果更好。
“Yes” to the EITC and pre-school education; “no” to subsidies for oil, agriculture, and mortgage debt.	这意味着赞成劳动收入税收抵免和学前教育政策；对石油、农业和抵押债务补贴政策投反对票。
The alternative to such engagement is a very roundabout strategy that would achieve more enlightened policies by weakening the ability of the rich to buy votes.	还有一种替代方案是采取迂回策略，通过削弱富人购买选票的能力来推进更开明的政策。
However important that goal may be, attaining it requires reducing the share of income that goes to the rich by addressing inequality, which requires pursuing pro-equality policies, like the EITC and pre-school education.	但无论那个目标有多重要，它的实现需要通过解决不平等问题控制富人所得到的收入，而这反过来又需要实行以劳动收入税收抵免和学前教育为代表的促进平等的政策。
Is complaining about oligarchy really a more effective strategy for achieving these policies than arguing the case for them directly?	从策略上讲，难道抱怨寡头政治真的比直接为穷人说话更加有效？
	
The Dollar and Its Rivals	美元和它的对手
CAMBRIDGE – Since 1976, the US dollar’s role as an international currency has been slowly waning.	美国剑桥—1976年以来，美元作为国际货币的角色一直在缓慢减弱。
International use of the dollar to hold foreign-exchange reserves, denominate financial transactions, invoice trade, and as a vehicle in currency markets is below its level during the heyday of the Bretton Woods era, from 1945 to 1971.	国际上用美元作为外汇储备、为金融交易计价、结算贸易以及货币市场载体的程度还不如1945—1971年布雷顿森林时代的鼎盛期。
But most people would be surprised by what the most recent numbers show.	但大部分人会对最新数字所揭示的东西感到震惊。
There is an abundance of explanations for the downward trend.	对于这一衰落趋势，解释层出不穷。
Since the Vietnam War, US budget deficits, money creation, and current-account deficits have often been high.	自越战以来，美国的预算赤字、货币创造和经常项目赤字总是非常高。
Presumably as a result, the dollar has lost value relative to other major currencies or in terms of purchasing power.	美元相对其他主要货币的价值或者美元的购买力有所损失也不足为奇。
Meanwhile, the US share of global output has declined.	与此同时，美国站全球产出的份额也有所下降。
And, most recently, the disturbing willingness of some members of the US Congress to pursue a strategy that would cause the Treasury to default on legal obligations has undermined global confidence in the dollar’s privileged status.	而在最近，美国国会的一些议员有一种危险的意图 — — 追求将导致财政部对其法定债务违约的战略，这影响了全球对美元特权地位的信心。
Moreover, some emerging-market currencies are joining the club of international currencies for the first time.	此外，一些新兴市场货币正在首次进入国际货币俱乐部。
Indeed, some analysts have suggested that the Chinese renminbi may rival the dollar as the leading international currency by the end of the decade.	事实上，一些分析师指出，到这个十年结束时，人民币可能挑战美元作为领先国际货币的地位。
But the dollar’s status as an international currency has not fallen uniformly.	但美元作为国际货币的地位并没有一路下降。
Interestingly, the periods when the public is most concerned about the issue do not coincide with the periods when the dollar’s share in international transactions is in fact falling.	有趣的是，公众最担心这一问题的时期往往并不是美元在国际交易中的份额下降的时期。
By the criteria of international use as a reserve currency among central banks and as a vehicle in foreign-exchange markets, the most rapid declines took place from 1978 to 1991 and from 2001 to 2010.	以作为各央行储备货币的国际使用以及作为外汇市场载体的标准看，美元坠落速度最快的阶段是1978—1991年和2001—2010年。
Between these two intervals, from 1992 to 2000, there was a clear reversal of the trend, notwithstanding a popular orgy of dollar declinism around the middle of that decade.	在这两个时期之间，即1992—2000年，美元的衰落之势出现了显而易见的反转，尽管在这个十年中间美元衰落论甚嚣尘上。
Central banks held only an estimated 46% of their foreign-exchange reserves in dollars in 1992, but that share rebounded to almost 70% by 2000.	1992年，在各国央行所持有的外汇储备中，大概只有46%是美元，但在2000年这一比例上升到约70 % 。
Subsequently, the long-term downward trend resumed.	接着，长期衰落之势恢复。
According to one estimate, the dollar’s share in central-banks’ foreign reserves declined from about 70% in 2001 to barely 60% in 2010.	根据一项估算，美元在央行外汇储备中所占比重从2001年的约70%下降到2010年的60%略多。
During the same decade, its share in the foreign-exchange market also declined: the dollar constituted one side or the other in 90% of foreign-exchange trades in 2001, but only 85% in 2010.	在同一时期，美元占外汇市场的比重也有所下降：2001年，以美元为一方的交易占外汇交易的90 % ， 到2010年，这一比例为85 % 。
The International Monetary Fund’s most recent statistics suggest, unexpectedly, another pause in the dollar’s long-term decline.	国际货币基金组织（IMF）的最新数字表明，出乎意料，美元的长期衰落之势再一次停了下来。
According to the IMF, the dollar’s share in foreign-exchange reserves stopped falling in 2010 and has been flat since then.	根据IMF的数据，美元占外汇储备的比重在2010年停止下降，此后一直保持稳定。
If anything, the share is up slightly thus far in 2013.	2013年（到目前为止）还略有上升。
Similarly, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) reported in its recent triennial survey that the dollar’s share in the world’s foreign-exchange trades rose from 85% in 2010 to 87% in 2013.	类似地，国际清算银行（BIS）在其最新一期三年调查中指出美元占世界外汇交易的比重从2010年的85%提高到2013年的87 % 。
Given dysfunctional US fiscal policy, the dollar’s resilience is surprising.	考虑到美国财政政策功能失调的状况，美元的恢复力令人吃惊。
Or maybe we should no longer be surprised.	也许我们本不应该吃惊。
After all, when the global financial crisis erupted in 2008 from the bowels of the American subprime-mortgage market, global investors responded by fleeing to the US, not from it.	毕竟，当美国次贷市场引发2008年全球金融危机时，全球投资者的反应是逃向美国，而不是从美国出逃。
They obviously still regard US Treasury bills as a safe haven and the dollar as the top international currency, especially given the absence of good alternatives.	他们显然仍把美国国债视为安全港，把美元视为顶级国际货币，特别是在没有出色替代品的情况下。
In particular, the euro has its own all-too-obvious problems.	特别地，欧元有其自身的一目了然的问题。
Indeed, the euro’s share in reserve holdings and foreign-exchange transactions have both declined by several percentage points in the most recent statistics.	事实上，在最新的统计数字中，欧元在储备和外汇交易中的比重均下降了几个百分点。
At the same time, the IMF’s data indicate that the vaunted renminbi is not yet among the top seven currencies in terms of central-bank reserve holdings.	与此同时，IMF数据表明，从央行储备货币角度讲，受到热捧的人民币还拍不到前七名。
And, according to the BIS, while the renminbi has finally broken into the top ten currencies in foreign-exchange markets, it still accounts for only 2.2% of all transactions, just behind the Mexican peso’s 2.5% share.	而根据BIS的数据，尽管人民币终于进入了外汇市场前十名，但只占全部交易的2.2 % ， 还不如墨西哥比索的2.5 % 。
Despite recent moves by the Chinese government, the renminbi still has a long way to go.	尽管中国政府最近出台了一些措施，但人民币还有很长的路要走。
To try to explain the recent stabilization of the dollar’s status, one might note something that the last three years have in common with the previous period of temporary reversal from 1992 to 2000: striking improvements in the US budget deficit.	要想解释最近的美元地位趋稳之势，可以把注意力放在过去三年与1992—2000年衰落之势暂时扭转期间的相似之处：美国预算赤字大幅改善。
By the end of the 1990’s, the record deficits of the 1980’s had been transformed into record surpluses; today, the federal deficit is less than half its 2010 level.	到20世纪90年代末，80年代创纪录的赤字变为创纪录的盈余；如今，联邦赤字也不到2010年水平的一半。
Perhaps the fiscal observation is a coincidence.	也许这一财政现象是一种巧合。
After all, it would be foolish to read too much into two historical data points.	毕竟，对两组历史数据点做过多解读是十分愚蠢的。
It would be even more foolish to believe that just because American politicians have failed to dislodge the US dollar from its paramount status over the last 40 years, they could not accomplish the job with another few decades of effort.	更加愚蠢的是相信正如美国政客在过去四十年都破坏美元至高无上的地位，他们在今后几十年也无法做到。
It is not an eternal law of nature that the dollar shall always be number one.	美元永远是第一，这决非宇宙真理。
The pound sterling had the top spot in the nineteenth century, only to be surpassed by the dollar in the first half of the twentieth century.	十九世纪拥有顶级地位的是英镑，但在二十世纪上半叶就被美元超越。
The day may come when the dollar, too, succumbs to a rival. But today is not that day.	美元也有被后浪拍死在沙滩上的一天，但肯定不是今天。
	
Absent America	缺席的美国
CAMBRIDGE – The US Congress has now carelessly blocked a long-awaited reform of the International Monetary Fund.	发自剑桥 — — 美国国会草率地阻止了国际货币基金组织一项期待已久的改革。
That would be bad enough if it were an isolated episode. But this is just the latest in a series of self-inflicted blows since the turn of the century that have needlessly undermined the United States’ claim to global leadership.	如果这只是一起孤立事件那也够糟糕的了，但这仅仅是自世纪之交以来一系列自毁行动的最新一起而已，对美国所企求的全球领导力造成了毫不必要的削弱。
The IMF reform would have been an important step in updating the allocations of quotas, which determine member states’ monetary contributions and voting power.	国际货币基金组织的改革本是更新配额分配的重要一步，它决定了成员国货币的赞助额和投票权。
The US was not being asked to contribute more money or lose its voting weight, which has always given it a unique veto power.	这并没有要求美国赞助更多或是降低其投票权重，以及一直给予它的特殊否决权。
Instead, the proposed increase in quotas for China, India, Brazil, and other emerging economies would have come largely at the expense of European countries.	相反，提案所增加的中国，印度，巴西以及其他新兴经济体配额主要是通过缩小欧洲国家的相关配额来实现的。
The change in IMF quotas is a partial and overdue response to the newcomers’ rising economic weight and Europe’s outdated dominance.	国际货币基金组织配额的变化是对新力量崛起以及欧洲统治衰落的一个局部而滞后的响应。
Indeed, the principle of matching representation to countries’ contributions – sometimes known as the Golden Rule (“He who has the gold, rules”) – is probably one of the reasons that the IMF has usually been more effective than other international organizations (for example, the United Nations General Assembly).	事实上，把各国的赞助额与其责任相匹配的准则 — — 有时被称为黄金准则 （ “ 谁拥有黄金，谁制定规则 ” ） — — 也许是国际货币基金组织通常比其他国际组织（例如联合国大会）更有效的原因。
To be sure, US President Barack Obama has tried to exercise global leadership.	无可否认，美国总统巴拉克·奥巴马试图实施全球领导。
He pushed for the agreement to reform the IMF at the G-20 summit in Seoul in November 2010 (the first meeting to be hosted by a non-G-7 country), and he prevailed over understandable European reluctance to cede power.	他在2010年11月首尔G20峰会（第一届由非G7国家举办的会议）上推动改革国际货币基金组织的协议，并且成功说服了那些显然不愿放弃权力的欧洲国家。
But congressional rejection of an international agreement that the president had painstakingly persuaded the rest of the world to accept is not a new pattern.	但是国会否决一个总统煞费苦心说服世界接受的国际协议可不是什么新鲜事。
It goes back a century, to President Woodrow Wilson’s inability in 1919 to persuade a myopically isolationist Congress to approve the League of Nations.	这可以追溯到一个世纪以前，伍德罗·威尔逊总统在1919年就无法说服短视且奉行孤立主义的国会批准国际联盟成立。
Since then, Congress has rejected the International Trade Organization (1948), the SALT II nuclear agreement (1979), and the Kyoto Protocol (1997), among others.	自那以后，国会否决过国际贸易组织（1948年 ） ， 《第二阶段限制战略武器条约 》 （ 1979年 ） ， 以及《京都议定书 》 （ 1997年）等等。
A history of trying to reopen international negotiations that the executive has already concluded is also the reason why Congress has to give Obama so-called trade promotion authority (which entails fast-track congressional votes on trade agreements).	而历史上也不乏重开已关闭国际谈判的尝试，这也是为何国会必须向奥巴马授予所谓的“贸易促进授权 ” （ 以加快贸易协议方面的国会投票进程 ） 。
Otherwise, America’s trading partners will not negotiate seriously in ongoing regional and global trade negotiations.	不然的话美国的贸易伙伴们就不会认真进行现有的区域和全球贸易谈判。
Commentators have been warning since the 1980’s that the US may lose its global hegemony for economic reasons – budget deficits, a declining share of global GDP, and the switch from net international creditor to net debtor – with the historical hypothesis of imperial overreach gaining renewed attention.	自1980年代以来评论家们一直警告美国可能会由于经济上的原因 — — 预算赤字，全球GDP份额的下降，从净债权国变为净债务国 — — 而丢失其世界霸权，同时帝国过度扩张的历史假说也重新得到关注。
But the main problem seems to be a lack of will rather than a thin wallet.	但主要的问题似乎是缺乏意愿而不是经济的匮乏。
Or perhaps it would be more accurate to describe the problem as one of wild swings in US domestic politics between excessive isolationism and excessive foreign intervention in response to short-term events, and untempered by any longer-term historical perspective.	或者可以把问题更准确的描述为：美国国内政治在应对某些短期事件时在过度孤立主义和过度干涉行为之间大幅摇摆，并缺乏任何长期历史视角的指导。
These days, after a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan at an estimated cost of $4 trillion (including the medical care that veterans will need for the rest of their lives), the pendulum has apparently swung back in the direction of isolationism.	到目前为止，也就是伊拉克和阿富汗战争结束十年以来，估计花费了4万亿美元（包括老兵们养老送终所需的医疗保健 ） ， 钟摆的方向显然已经回到孤立主义那一侧。
One had hoped that the shortsighted members of Congress who foolishly shut down the US government three months ago had become aware of the damage caused to America’s credibility and global leadership.	人们希望，那些在三个月前愚蠢地让美国政府关门的，目光短浅的国会成员已经意识到该事件对美国造成的信誉和全球领导力的损害。
Most visibly, the Obama administration had to cancel its participation at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Bali in October, impeding progress on the US-led Trans-Pacific Partnership.	最明显的是，奥巴马政府不得不缺席十月在巴厘岛举行的亚太经济合作组织（APEC）峰会，阻碍了美国���主导的跨太平洋伙伴关系的进程。
It was widely reported that Asian countries concluded from Obama’s absence that they should cultivate ties with China instead.	大量报道称，亚洲国家从奥巴马的缺席中得出结论：它们应该转而培养与中国的关系。
The growing power of China and other major emerging-market countries is a reality.	中国以及其他主要新兴市场国家权力日益膨胀是一个现实。
That is precisely why it is so important that the US support a greater role for these countries in international institutions such as the IMF, the G-20, and APEC.	这正是为何美国支持这些国家在国际货币基金组织，20国集团，亚太经合组织等国际机构承担更大作用是如此重要。
The rise of China could go well or badly, depending in part on whether the status quo powers make room for the newcomer – a risk to international stability first noted by Thucydides, who traced the cause of the Peloponnesian War to Sparta’s response to the rising power of Athens.	中国的崛起是好是坏，在某种程度上取决于现有势力是否能为新人腾出空间 — — 这是最早被古希腊历史学家修昔底德所意识到的一项国际稳定风险，他发现伯罗奔尼撒战争的原因正是斯巴达对雅典力量崛起的回应。
Likewise, failure to accommodate Germany’s rise contributed a century ago to the outbreak of World War I.	同样，一个世纪以前，对德国崛起的无法容纳导致了一战的爆发
Though Chinese President Xi Jinping’s call for “a new type of great power relations” may sound anodyne, the phrase apparently demonstrates awareness of the “Thucydides trap.”	尽管中国国家主席习近平呼吁“一个新的大国关系模式”听起来很平淡无奇，但这句话显然表明了对“修昔底德陷阱”的警觉。
It signals China’s openness to working with other countries to avoid a repetition of the tragedies of 431 BC and 1914 AD.	它体现出中国愿意与其他国家开放合作以避免重复公元前431年和公元1914年的大悲剧。
It is only sensible to take him up on his offer.	唯一明智的方法就是接受他的提议。
The continuing potential for US global leadership, despite America’s move from global creditor to debtor, has partly been a matter of luck.	除了从全球债权人变成了债务人之外，美国全球领导力的持续延续在某种程度上只是碰运气而已。
In the Asia-Pacific region, historical and territorial frictions among Japan, Korea, and China have ensured that America’s presence remains more welcome than it otherwise would be.	在亚太地区，日本，韩国和中国的历史和领土摩擦保证了美国的存在仍然比它的缺席更受欢迎。
Meanwhile, Europe’s fiscal follies have been even more egregious than America’s.	与此同时，欧洲财政政策的愚蠢程度甚至已经超过了美国。
Asians are acutely aware that the IMF has intervened in the euro crisis with much greater support than it provided during the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98, and they understandably feel entitled to a larger say in how the Fund is run.	亚洲人清醒地意识到，国际货币基金组织在介入欧元危机时提供了比1997-1998年亚洲金融危机时期更多的支持，因此也顺理成章地认定应该对组织的运作有更多的话语权。
But the emerging-market countries have been so disunited that in 2011 they failed to support a common candidate for IMF Managing Director.	但新兴市场国家是如此难以团结，以致在2011年它们未能推举自己的共同候选人去竞选国际货币基金组织主席的。
As a result, though the three previous incumbents were Europeans who did not complete their terms in office, another European, Christine Lagarde, won the top spot yet again.	结果尽管前三任未能完成任期的主席都是欧洲人，但另一个欧洲人，克里斯蒂娜·拉加德再次夺得头把交椅。
(Lagarde has done a good job, rather than kowtowing to Europe, but that is beside the point.)	（拉加德工作非常出色，并没有对欧洲唯命是从，但这不是重点。 ）
Latent global demand for enlightened US leadership, which first appeared at the end of World War I, can survive budgetary constraints and even misguided military interventions. What it cannot survive is an abdication of interest by the US Congress.	对美国开明领导的潜在全球需求最早始于第一次世界大战结束之时，并能在预算收缩甚至误入歧途的军事干预中保存下来，但却逃不过美国国会对这一利益的主动放弃。
	
Fischer, the Fed, and US Growth	费希尔、美联储和美国的增长
CAMBRIDGE – Now that Janet Yellen has been confirmed as Chair of the US Federal Reserve Board, attention has turned to her successor as Vice Chair.	美国剑桥—耶伦即将担任美国联邦储蓄委员会主席，于是人们的注意力转向了谁将接替她担任副主席。
US President Barack Obama's choice, Stanley Fischer, was the perfect candidate, given his unique combination of skills, qualities, and experience.	斯坦利·费希尔（Stanley Fischer）是理想人选，因为他拥有无与伦比的技能、资质和经验组合。
During his academic career, Fischer was one of the most accomplished scholars of monetary economics.	在学术生涯中，费希尔是货币经济学界成就最高的学者之一。
He then served as Chief Economist of the World Bank, First Deputy Managing Director at the International Monetary Fund, and, most recently, as Governor of the Bank of Israel.	接着，他担任过世界银行首席经济学家、国际货币基金组织（IMF）第一副总裁，最近又担任了以色列银行行长。
He starred in each of these positions.	在这些岗位上，费希尔都做出了斐然的成绩。
Indeed, one has trouble thinking of another economist (at least since John Maynard Keynes) who has done as well as Fischer at combining analytical skill, sound policy judgment, clear expression, selfless dedication to improving the world, and the ability to get things done – with imperturbable good humor.	事实上，你很难想象还有哪位经济学家（至少从凯恩斯以来）能像费希尔那样完美结合了分析技能、可靠的政策判断、清晰的表达、对世界的无私奉献以及把事情做对的能力 — — 而且还具备了冷静幽默的特质。
Moreover, Fischer gained extensive crisis-management experience during his tenure at the IMF in the 1990’s and as Israel’s central banker during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.	此外，在20世纪90年代在IMF以及2008—2009全球金融危机中在以色列央行任职期间，费希尔积累了丰富的危机管理经验。
That makes him an ideal match for Yellen, who is also an unusually accomplished academic and policymaker, but who is at her best when she has had a chance to prepare meticulously.	这使他成为耶伦的理想搭档。 耶伦也是成就卓著的学者和决策者，但在可以充分准备时，她从来不遗余力。
Fischer’s qualities were acclaimed last month at the IMF’s Annual Research Conference by, among others, outgoing Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, who in the 1970’s was one of Fischer’s many MIT doctoral students (as was I).	费希尔的素质在上个月的IMF研究年会上得到了广泛赞誉，即将卸任的美联储伯南克也致了赞辞，在20世纪70年代，他是费希尔的多位麻省理工学院博士生之一（算是我的同门师兄弟 ） 。
The same conference has been much discussed for another reason: Larry Summers, Paul Krugman, and Fed officials each advanced provocative theses concerning the slow pace of economic growth in the United States and other advanced economies in recent years.	此次IMF研究年会因为另一个原因而广受关注：拉里·萨默斯（Larry Summers ） 、 保罗·克鲁格曼（Paul Krugman）和各美联储官员都讨论了近几年来美国和其他发达经济体经济增长不力这一棘手问题。
These theses will be important influences on the Fed in 2014 and beyond.	这一话题将对2014年及其后的美联储产生重要影响。
Summers’s controversial explanation for slow growth has received the most attention.	萨默斯对增长缓慢的争议解释受到了最多关注。
The economic crisis, he argued, is not over until it is over, which it is not yet.	他说，经济危机只有过去之后才算过去，而现在还没有过去。
He boldly suggested that the reason for sub-par growth over the last ten years is a fundamental structural change, identified as “secular stagnation”: the natural, or equilibrium, real (inflation-adjusted) interest rate may have fallen below zero – perhaps as low as negative 2-3% – “forever.”	他大胆指出，过去十年的增长萎靡的原因是一种根本性的结构变迁，他称之为“长期停滞 ” ： 自然（或均衡）实际（经通胀调整的）利率“永远”地降到了零以下 — — 可能低达负的2—3 % 。
There are, according to Summers, two possible reasons for this: a saving glut coming from Asia or a long-term IT-induced decline in the relative price of capital goods that has reduced needed investment relative to saving.	按萨默斯的说法，造成这一局面的可能原因有两个：来自亚洲的储蓄过剩以及由IT造成的资本品相对价格的长期下跌降低了投资相对储蓄的需求。
(Krugman offers more possible explanations: declining rates of population or productivity growth.)	（克鲁格曼提供了更多的可能解释：人口或生产率增长下降。 ）
Whatever the cause, if Summers is right, we are in deep trouble.	不管原因如何，如果萨默斯是对的，那么我们陷入了大麻烦。
As it is, central banks can have difficulty attaining a sufficiently low real interest rate in recessions, because the nominal interest rate cannot go below zero.	央行可能难以在衰退时期维持充分低的实际利率，因为名义利率不能低于零。
In Summers’s scenario, the negative equilibrium rate would mean chronically slow growth.	在萨默斯提出的情景中，负均衡利率意味着长时期增长低迷。
Fischer himself expressed greater optimism at the conference that monetary policy can work, even under current conditions.	在IMF研究年会上，费希尔本人对货币政策的作用要更乐观一些，即便是在当前环境下。
Quantitative easing and forward guidance can push down the long-term interest rate.	量化宽松和前瞻性指引可以拉低长期利率。
And there are other channels besides the real interest rate: the exchange rate, equity prices, the real-estate market, and the credit channel.	而除了实际利率，还有其他渠道：汇率、股价、房地产市场和信用渠道。
Fed staff members are less prone than professors to go out on a paradigm-shaking limb.	美联储官员不像教授们那样喜欢做范式研究。
But David Wilcox, Director of Research and Statistics at the Fed, and his co-authors argue that the severity and duration of the downturn that began in December 2007 has been steadily eroding the capital stock and the size and skills of the labor force.	但美联储研究和统计主管大卫·韦尔考克斯（David Wilcox）与合作者指出，始于2007年12月的衰退程度之严重、持续时间之长在逐渐侵蚀资本存量和劳动力规模和技能。
Thus, slow US output and employment growth in the last few years is a result of the financial crisis, not of exogenous structural change.	因此，过去几年美国产出和就业增长缓慢是金融危机的结果，而不是外生结构变迁的结果。
Without customers, firms do not build new factories, even when the cost of capital is low, while workers who have been unemployed for a long time may drop out of the labor force altogether.	没有客户，企业就不会建设新厂，即使资本成本很低；而长期找不到工作的工人可能会完全退出劳动力。
The result, as Wilcox and his colleagues persuasively argue, is that productive capacity and the effective labor force have moved onto diminished growth paths.	结果，正如韦尔考克斯及其同事雄辩地指出的，产能和有效劳动力进入了下降增长轨道。
The cumulative supply shortfall – the authors estimate that potential output is now 7% below the pre-2007 trajectory – may be larger than the current output shortfall attributable to the ongoing lack of aggregate demand.	累计供给缺口 — — 韦尔考克斯及其同事估算，现今潜在产出比2007年前的水平低7 % — —可能比总需求持续不振所导致的当前产出缺口程度更大。
This unfortunate recent history makes the Fed’s job even harder than it has been, because it further limits policymakers’ ability to stimulate growth without causing inflation.	这段不幸的历史让美联储的责任比以往更艰难了，因为这进一步限制了决策者在不引起通胀的前提下刺激增长的能力。
At the same time, given the potential for long-lasting damage to growth, it has become even more important to maintain adequate demand stimulus so long as unemployment remains high.	与此同时，由于可能对增长造成长期伤害，在失业高企时维持足够的需求刺激就变得更加重要了。
The Wilcox paper thus supports continued monetary ease in 2014.	因此，韦尔考克斯的论文支持在2014年继续保持货币宽松。
Krugman’s presentation at the IMF conference was as surprising as the others: concerns about US fiscal deficits and debt are misplaced even in the longer term.	克鲁格曼在IMF研究年会上的发言也是语出惊人：即使从长期看，对美国财政赤字和债务的担忧也弄错了对象。
Deficit hawks worry that at some point global investors will lose their enthusiasm for holding ever-greater amounts of US debt, resulting in a sharp depreciation of the dollar.	赤字鹰派担心，全球投资者总有一天会不再热衷于持有不断膨胀的美国债务，导致美元急剧贬值。
Krugman’s controversial claim is that, even if this were to happen, interest rates would not rise, while the depreciation’s effect on the US economy would be expansionary (via an increase in net exports).	克鲁格曼的争议结论则是，即使真的发生这一幕，利率也不会上升，同时贬值对美国经济将具有扩张效应（通过增加净出口 ） 。
The policy implication is that there is less reason to worry about the long-term debt problem and more reason to worry that fiscal contraction over the last three years has been depriving the economy of needed demand.	其政策含义是，不用太过担心长期债务问题，而要更多地担心过去三年中的财政收缩制约了美国经济所需要的需求。
The policy failures have indeed been remarkable.	事实上，政策失误相当可观。
Though prompt action halted the 2008 financial meltdown, and initial monetary and fiscal stimulus helped to end the recession itself in 2009, the recovery since then has been painfully slow, owing mainly to destructive fiscal policy: misguided drag in 2010-13; repeated self-inflicted crises in 2011-13; and no progress on the genuine longer-term fiscal problem.	尽管大手笔动作阻止了2008年金融崩溃，一开始的货币和财政刺激也为2009年结束衰退贡献了力量，但此后的复苏极其缓慢，主要原因就在于破坏性财政政策：2010—2013年受误导的拖累；2011—2013年反复的自作自受式危机；以及在真正的长期财政问题上毫无进展。
Together, these fiscal failures have probably subtracted more than a percentage point from US growth in each of the last three years.	总而言之，在过去三年中，这些财政失误有可能每年都造成美国经济增长减少了一个多百分点。
But there are grounds for optimism in 2014.	但有理由对2014年保持乐观。
For the first time in four years, fiscal policy probably will not have a negative effect on growth.	四年来，财政政策第一次有望不再对增长产生消极影响。
True, it would be better if fiscal policy could make a positive contribution.	当然，如果财政政策可以产生积极影响那就更好了。
But ending the negative contributions is cause for celebration.	但不再起负面作用已足以值得庆贺。
Meanwhile, monetary policy will be in good hands, especially now that Fischer has joined the team.	与此同时，货币政策将掌握在能人手中，特别是拥有费希尔的团队。
	
Market Failure and Political Failure	市场失灵与政治失灵
PARIS – Markets can fail.	发自巴黎 — — 市场会出现失灵。
But, as has been demonstrated in areas like air pollution, traffic congestion, spectrum allocation, and tobacco consumption, market mechanisms are often the best way for governments to address such failures.	但正如类似空气污染，交通拥堵，电信频率分配以及香烟消费等问题所展现的那样，市场机制往往是政府应对这类失灵问题的最佳手段。
So why are such mechanisms now in retreat?	但为何如今这些机制却逐渐失去了用武之地？
Consider markets for emissions allowances, in which firms that can cheaply cut air pollution trade with those that cannot.	以排放配额市场为例，在市场里那些可以低成本减少排放的企业可以和其他企业做交易。
A decade ago, the idea that such markets could achieve desired environmental goals at relatively low cost was widely recognized and implemented.	十年前，一直有主张认为这类市场可以用相对低廉的成本来实现既定的环保目标，并且得到了广泛的认同和实施。
Today, however, politics is killing “cap and trade.”	但如今政治却在扼杀“设限+交易 ” （ cap and trade）方案。
In the United States, the highly successful cap-and-trade system for sulfur-dioxide emissions has effectively vanished.	在美国，取得了极大成功的二氧化硫“设限+交易”系统基本上销声匿迹了。
In Europe, the Emissions Trading System (ETS), the world’s largest market for carbon allowances, has become increasingly irrelevant as well.	欧洲的排放交易系统这个全球最大的碳排放配额市场也逐渐变得形同虚设。
On both sides of the Atlantic, market-oriented environmental regulation has in effect been superseded over the last five years by older “command-and-control” approaches, by which the government dictates who should use which technologies, in what amounts, to reduce which emissions.	在大西洋另一端，市场主导的环境监管在过去5年中被旧式的“命令+控制 ” （ command and control）手段所取代，谁要用哪种技术去减少某个数量的特定排放物，一切都由政府说了算。
Cap and trade was originally supposed to be a Republican idea in the US: its backers were those who considered themselves pro-market, not those who considered themselves pro-regulation.	在美国，设限+交易原本应当被视为一个共和党方案：其背后的支持者都是那些自认为倾向市场而非偏好管制的人。
Most environmental organizations initially opposed it, with many believing it immoral for corporations to be able to pay for the right to pollute.	大多数环保组织原本反对这一方案，许多人认为该方案有违道德，因为它容许企业付钱去购买污染的权利。
Indeed, it was Ronald Reagan’s administration that pioneered the use of cap and trade to phase out leaded gasoline in the 1980’s.	事实上，是罗纳德·里根总统的政府率先在1980年代运用设限+交易手段去淘汰含铅汽油。
George H. W. Bush’s administration used it to reduce SO2 emissions from power plants in the 1990’s, and his son’s administration sought to use it to reduce SO2 and other emissions further in the 2000’s.	老布什政府在1990年代沿用这一手段去减少发电厂的二氧化硫并取得了成功，随后其子小布什又试图用它进一步减少二氧化硫以及其他污染物排放。
The problem is not that cap and trade is an ivory-tower theory that cannot work in the real world; on the contrary, its performance surpassed expectations.	设限+交易并是一个不切实际的象牙塔理论；相反，它的效果超出了预期。
In the 1980’s, it enabled lead to be phased out more rapidly than predicted and at an estimated annual savings of $250 million relative to the command-and-control approach.	在1980年代它以超乎预计的速度淘汰了含铅燃料，并且估计比命令+控制政策每年节省2.5亿美元。
Similarly, emissions of SO2 were curbed at a much lower cost than even cap-and-trade proponents had predicted before 1995.	同样，限制二氧化硫排放的成本甚至比设限+交易的支持者们在1995年前预估的还要低
As recently as 2008, the Republican candidate for US president, Senator John McCain, had sponsored legislative proposals to use cap and trade to address emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.	到了近一点的2008年，共和党推举参议员约翰·麦凯恩（John McCain）为总统候选人，而他本人也支持美国立法使用设限+交易手段去应对二氧化碳和其他温室气体的排放问题。
But Republican politicians now seem to have forgotten that this approach was once their policy.	但如今共和党政治家们似乎忘记了自己曾有这么一个政策。
In 2009, they worked to defeat climate-change legislation by relying on anti-regulation rhetoric that demonized their own creation.	为了抵制2009年的气候变化立法，他们转而用反管制言论去把自身的产物妖魔化了。
This left only less market-friendly alternatives – especially after court cases upheld the validity of the 1970 Clean Air Act.	结果就只剩下不那么市场化的备选方案 — — 尤其是在相关诉讼维持了1970年洁净空气法案的法律效力之后。
Though such alternatives are less efficient, they are again the operative regime.	虽然这些备选方案效率不高，却依然占据主流地位。
Likewise, the European Union adopted the ETS in 2003 as a cost-effective way to achieve the commitments it had made under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.	在欧洲，设限+交易在十年前成为主导。
The ETS rapidly became the world’s largest system for putting a market price on environmental damage.	欧盟在2003年将排放交易系统采纳为兑现其1997年京都议定书承诺的一个高性价比手段，同时还迅速建立了全球最大的系统去为环境污染设定市场价格。
But now it has been pushed aside by other kinds of regulation.	但如今排放交易系统却被其他类型的管制手段排挤到了一边。
European directives require that 20% of energy must come from renewables by 2020.	欧洲的方针要求在2020年时必须有20%的能源来自于可再生能源。
But, while policymakers have helped drive down the price of emissions permits in the ETS by mandating and subsidizing renewable energy, the supply of permits has not been reduced.	政策制定者们通过批准和补贴可再生能源使得排放交易系统中的许可价格降低���但这类许可的供应却下降了。
As a result, demand now falls short of any binding constraint.	结果对许可的需求低到无法附加任何捆绑条款。
Indeed, the price of permits fell below three euros a ton in April 2013, rendering the emissions-trading market almost irrelevant.	到了2013年4月，许可价格已经跌到3欧元每吨，导致排放交易市场基本停滞。
This, in turn, has encouraged greater reliance on highly polluting coal – the worst energy source, from the standpoint of global warming. That would not have happened if the price mechanism still underpinned climate-change policy.	这反过来鼓励了企业更多地使用污染更严重的煤 — — 在全球变暖问题上危害最大的燃料 — — 而如果气候变化政策依然是以价格机制为的基础的话，这一切都不会发生。
Moreover, the EU’s renewables policy has also proved to be ruinously expensive.	此外，欧盟的可再生能源政策已经被证明是极端昂贵。
All of this should give pause to the European Council when it meets in March to consider how to extend the 2020 goals to 2030.	而这一切应该在3月欧洲议会商议如何将2020年目标延长到2030年时扭转过来。
There is a fascinating parallel between the evolution of American political attitudes toward market mechanisms in environmental regulation and Republican hostility to “Obamacare” (the 2010 Affordable Care Act).	美国针对环境管制中市场机制的政治态度的演化与共和党人对“奥巴马医改 ” （ 2010年《合理医疗费用法案 》 ） 的敌意之间存在着一个令人惊叹的平行关系。
The core of Obamacare is an attempt to ensure that all Americans have health insurance, via the individual mandate.	奥巴马医改的核心在于通过强制参保的方式确保所有美国人都能享有医疗保险。
But it is a market-oriented program insofar as health insurers and health-care providers remain private and compete against one other.	但这是一个市场主导的项目，因为医疗保险公司和医疗服务提供者都是私营企业而且相互竞争。
This was originally a conservative approach.	这原本是个保守的方法。
The two major alternatives to it are much further removed from the marketplace: a “single payer” system, as in Canada (or America’s Medicare system for the elderly), with the government providing health insurance, or “socialized medicine,” as in the United Kingdom (or the US Veterans Health Administration), with the government providing health care directly.	相比之下另外两个主要的替代方案都离市场更远：一个“单一付款人”体系，比如加拿大（或者美国的长者医疗体系 ） ， 由政府提供医疗保险；或者是“公费医疗 ” ， 比如英国（或者美国退伍军人卫生署 ） ， 由政政府直接提供医疗保障。
The approach taken by Obamacare was proposed in conservative think tanks such as the Heritage Foundation and enacted in Massachusetts by Republican Governor Mitt Romney.	而奥巴马医改所采用的方案是当年由美国传统基金会这类保守智库所提议，并由时任州长的共和党人米特·罗姆尼在马萨诸塞州推广应用。
But, by the time Obama adopted it, it had become anathema to Republicans, forcing Romney, the party’s presidential candidate in 2012, to run against his own record.	谁知当奥巴马采纳这一方法的时候，它却变成了共和党人的眼中钉，迫使罗姆尼这位2012年美国总统共和党候选人推翻自己过去的做法。
The market failure in the case of air pollution is what economists call an “externality”: those who pollute do not bear the entire cost.	在空气污染方面的市场失灵就是经济学家所说的“外部性 ” ： 那些污染者并未承担所有的成本。
The market failure in the case of health care is what economists call “adverse selection”: insurers may not provide insurance, especially to patients with pre-existing conditions, if they fear that healthy customers have already taken themselves out of the risk pool.	而在医疗保险方面的市场失灵则可归之为“逆向选择 ” ： 如果承保者有理由担心医疗消费者自身已经处于风险之下，那么他们就可能不会提供保障，尤其是对那些已经患病的病人。
But, again, government attempts to address market failures can themselves fail.	但与此同时，那些尝试应对市场失灵的政府自身也可能会失灵。
In the case of the environment, command-and-control regulation is inefficient, discourages innovation, and can have unintended consequences (like Europe’s growing reliance on coal).	在环境事务上，命令+管制监管手段效率低下，遏制创新，并可能引发意外后果（正如欧洲对煤的依赖上升 ） 。
In the case of health care, a national monopoly can forestall innovation and provide inadequate care with long waits.	而在医疗方面，一个国家垄断将会抑制创新，服务不充足，还会让患者轮候更长时间。
In general, the best government interventions target failures precisely – using cap and trade to put a price on air pollution, for example, or relying on the individual mandate to curtail adverse selection in health insurance – while letting market forces do the rest more efficiently than bureaucrats can.	总而言之，最佳的政府介入手段应当精确定位失灵之处 — — 使用设限+交易去给空气污染定价或者强制参保去减少医疗保险中的逆向选择 — — 并让市场力量比官僚更高效地去解决余下的其他问题。
	
African Leaders’ Eyes on the Prize	非洲领袖眼中的巨奖
CAMBRIDGE – On October 14, the Mo Ibrahim Prize Committee announced that for the second year in a row it had not found anyone to whom to award its Prize for Achievement in African Leadership. Why is that important?	发自剑桥 — — 10月14日，莫·易卜拉欣奖（Mo Ibrahim Prize）评选委员会宣布其已经连续第二年无法找到非洲领导成就奖的得主，而这又意味着什么呢？
The prize is given to a recently retired African head of state or government who was democratically elected, stepped down at the end of his or her constitutionally mandated term, and demonstrated exceptional leadership.	这个奖项会颁发给一位新近退休的非洲国家领袖，前提是这位领袖必须是由民主选举产生，在宪法规定的任期结束后退位，并展现出了杰出的领导能力。
The winner receives $5 million paid over ten years, followed by $200,000 annually for life, making it the world’s most valuable annual award.	得奖者将在头10年内领取500万美元奖金，然后每年领取20万美金直至过世，而这也令此奖成为了世界上最丰厚的年度奖项。
The Mo Ibrahim Foundation supports other important activities, particularly the annual Ibrahim Index of African Governance (IIAG), which was also released on October 14.	莫·易卜拉欣基金会同时也赞助其他一些重要的活动，例如每年评定一次，同样在10月14日发布的易卜拉欣非洲治理指数。
But I am especially intrigued by the prize.	但笔者最感到好奇的仍然是那个奖项。
It is a fascinating social-policy experiment, which deserves to be more widely known.	这是一场令人着迷的社会政策试验，也理应得到更多的关注。
Critics of the Ibrahim Prize argue that it makes Africa look bad, because in four out of seven years it has not been awarded to anyone.	有批评认为这个奖令非洲蒙羞，因为自该奖设立7年以来已经有4年出现的得奖者空缺。
It has also been argued that leaders should not have to be “bribed” into being good.	另一种说法认为领导人不应在这些巨奖的“贿赂”下去有所作为。
The good will be good, and the bad will be bad, regardless of the prize.	不管这个奖存不存在，开明者行仁政，暴君则祸国殃民，不会有任何改变。
I don’t buy these criticisms.	笔者不敢苟同这些批评。
Yes, other parts of the world also suffer from governance problems.	没错，世界其他地方也面对着治理问题。
And more people should be aware that many African countries have made substantial progress over the last decade, particularly with respect to economic growth, health, and education.	更多人也应该认识到许多非洲国家都在过去十年中取得了长足的进步，尤其是在经济发展，卫生和教育方面。
But those are not arguments against highlighting the important role of leadership in African countries’ success.	但这些论点都不能掩盖领导人在这些非洲国家取得的成就中所扮演的重要作用。
Given the abundant attention received by Africa’s truly awful leaders, it is useful to focus on its good ones.	考虑到人们已经对那些非洲暴君们给予了足够的关注，也是时候把目光移向那些好的领导人了。
And the money that comes with the Ibrahim Prize is enough that it could affect leaders’ behavior.	而莫·易卜拉欣奖的奖金也足以去影响这些领导人的行为。
The Ibrahim Prize was awarded in 2007, 2008, and 2011 to Presidents Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique, Festus Mogae of Botswana, and Pedro Verona Pires of Cape Verde, respectively.	莫·易卜拉欣奖曾分别颁发给莫桑比克前总统阿金·希萨诺（Joaquim Chissano，2007年度 ） ， 博茨瓦纳前总统费斯图斯·莫哈埃（Festus Mogae，2008年度）以及佛得角前总统佩德罗·皮雷斯（Pedro Verona Pires，2011年度 ） 。
Botswana and Cape Verde are two of the small-population countries that are consistently placed near the top in rankings of African governance, human development, and economic performance.	博茨瓦纳和佛得角这两个人口较少的非洲国家一般都会在非洲治理水平，人文发展和经济表现方面排名前列。
Mozambique is different: larger and historically in much worse shape, it suffered a terrible civil war from 1977 to 1992.	而莫桑比克则截然不同：国家更大，历史问题更多，1977年~1992年间曾持续内战。
Even after two decades of strong political and economic improvement, it still ranks low on most development indicators.	即便在经历了20年的强劲政治和经济发展，该国在大多数发展指数中的排名依旧偏低。
What defines good leadership is a notoriously complicated question.	优秀的领导该如何定义是一个极端复杂的问题。
Should leadership be evaluated according to criteria like economic prosperity, public health, respect for human rights, personal security, and peace?	它是否应该依据经济繁荣程度，公共卫生，人权状况，个人人身安全以及国家和平状态来评定？
Or are the proper criteria the leader’s character and competence, including his or her ability to inspire the country, choose good officials, formulate good policies, and implement them?	或者应该着眼于领袖的个人品质和治国方略，包括鼓舞国民奋发的魅力，甄选官员的眼光，制定和实施良好政策的能力？
In a word, is leadership a matter of outcomes or inputs?	简而言之，领导能力究竟是一个关于能力注入还是成果输出的事物？
Successful outcomes are obviously the ultimate objective.	虽然成功的成果输出显然是最终的目标。
But it is not useful to rely solely or primarily on outcomes to judge a leader.	但仅仅依靠成果来评断一位领袖是不行的。
Many factors beyond a leader’s control can block his or her country’s progress.	许多超出这位领导人控制的因素都会阻碍其国家的进步。
Even if good leadership means a demonstrated ability to prevail in the face of intransigent domestic political opposition, coup attempts, and invasions, surely no leader can be held responsible for the effects of droughts, floods, or other natural disasters.	即便优秀的领导才能意味着在面对国内顽固反对派，政变企图或者入侵时能展现其雄才大略，但显然没有谁能可以为干旱，洪涝或者其他自然灾害负责。
Admittedly, a leader’s integrity and competence are more difficult to measure than outcomes (such as per capita income, life expectancy, infant mortality, literacy, and crime).	必须承认，一个领导人的品质和能力要比其成果（诸如人均收入、预期寿命、新生儿死亡率，识字率和犯罪率）更加难以测量。
But some of the component indicators of the IIAG (such as rule of law, bureaucratic red tape, and fiscal policy) are more directly under government control.	但易卜拉欣非洲治理指数中的某些成分指数（例如法治成都，官僚办事作风以及财政政策）都更直接地处于政府当局控制之下。
In any case, one would not expect prize committees or historians to judge leaders solely by quantitative criteria.	无论如何，我们都不会期望评选委员会或者历史学家会仅仅依靠量化指标去评价一个领导人。
Few Americans thought Harry Truman had been a good president immediately after he left office, but now he is rated very high.	在美国总统哈里·杜鲁门（Harry Truman）下台时民望很低，但今时今日人们却对他评价甚高。
In Mexico, Carlos Salinas looked good at the time, but is now viewed poorly, while the accomplishments of his successor, Ernesto Zedillo, now appear bold, historic, innovative, and valuable.	在墨西哥，前总统卡洛斯·萨利纳斯（Carlos Salinas）当年非常风光，如今却遭到甚多批评，因为他的继任者埃内斯托. 塞迪略（Ernesto Zedillo）所取得成就在今天看来更为大刀阔斧，具历史意义，别开生面且有价值。
The list of eligible candidates for the Ibrahim Prize begins with those who were democratically elected and left office constitutionally within the preceding three years.	莫·易卜拉欣奖的候选名单首先会从那些民选上台并在随后三年内依宪法规定离任的领导人开始。
In a typical year, there may be as few as three candidates who meet these qualifications.	一般来说，在一年里都会有三位领导人符合这一条件。
The question is then whether any candidate demonstrated the necessary level of excellence in office.	但问题是这些人是否于在位之时体现出了足够优秀的治国能力。
In 2009, 2010, 2012, and now 2013, the prize committee decided that none had.	在2009，2010，2012和今年，评奖委员的决议是没人能做到这一点。
Does that mean that the prize has failed to meet the objective of encouraging good leadership in Africa?	拿这是否意味着该奖项无法实现其鼓励非洲优秀领导实践的目标？
Consider a ruler who comes to power with good intentions and great abilities.	试想一位才能卓越的统治者胸怀治国雄心上台执政。
Assume that he accomplishes much for his country during his first term (or his first two or three terms if the constitution allows it). But he stays too long (Uganda’s Yoweri Museveni comes to mind).	假设他在自己的第一个任期内（或者包含宪法许可下最初的一两次连任内）为国家做了许多实事，但他却过于恋栈 — — 正如乌干达总统约韦里·穆塞韦尼（Yoweri Museveni ） 。
He forces through constitutional changes so that he can run for more terms.	他强制修改宪法条文好让自己能继续连任下去。
Then he starts rigging elections and suppressing opposition.	然后此人开始操纵选举和镇压反对派。
He or members of his family nurture large overseas bank accounts.	而自己及其亲属则向海外转移了巨额财富。
Such leaders’ personalities may have changed.	这种领导人的品质或许已经发生了变化。
They may now regard themselves as indispensable.	他们也许觉得自己是必不可少的。
They have been corrupted by power, like the porcine elite in George Orwell’s Animal Farm.	他们被权力所腐蚀，正如乔治·奥威尔（George Orwell）在其名著《动物农场》中所描写的猪族精英那样。
At this point, they are unlikely to be influenced by the money that comes with the Ibrahim Prize.	到这个时候，这些人也不会被莫·易卜拉欣奖的奖金所打动了。
But now consider a leader who would prefer to serve honestly throughout his term and depart voluntarily. This path might leave a retirement with few resources for him and his family, little in the way of prestige or a platform from which to speak, and perhaps persecution by his successors.	但如果换成是一位愿意在自己任期内忠心服务国家并在任期届满时自愿下台的领导人，他的清廉可能意味着自己和家人的退休生活不甚宽裕，没有什么提升社会地位的途径也缺乏可供发声的平台，甚至可能遭到继任者的迫害。
It is precisely such a leader for whom the Ibrahim Prize could make the difference, influencing him to continue on the high road.	那么莫·易卜拉欣奖就能改变这样一位领导人的际遇，令他可以继续尊贵地活着。
If the experiment works, however, the main fruits will lie in the future.	然而，如果这个实验有效的话，主要的成果将体现在未来。
The Ibrahim Prize was established only in 2007, which means that the candidates have served most of their terms in office at a time when the prize could not have influenced their behavior.	莫·易卜拉欣奖在2007年才成立，意味着候选人们的任期主要都是在奖项设立之前，因此也无法为了奖金改变其行为。
If it does have the desired effect, we should start seeing winners in more years.	如果该奖确实能实现其预想效果的话，那么我们将在未来看见更多的获奖者。
	
Sovereign Debt at Square One	回到起点的主权债务
CAMBRIDGE – Argentina and its bankers have been barred from making payments to fulfill debt-restructuring agreements reached with the country’s creditors, unless the 7% of creditors who rejected the agreements are paid in full – a judgment that is likely to stick, now that the US Supreme Court has upheld it.	美国剑桥—阿根廷及其银行家被禁止偿还债务以履行与该国债权人达成的债务重组协议，除非拒绝该协议的7%债权人获得足额偿付 — — 美国最高法院支持的情况看，这一判决可能无法推翻了。
Though it is hard to cry for Argentina, the ruling in favor of the holdouts is bad news for the global financial system and sets back the evolution of the international regime for restructuring sovereign debt.	尽管我们大可不必为阿根廷哭泣，但这一有利于顽固坚持的判决对全球金融体系来说是一个坏消息，也让重组主权债务的国际机制发生了倒退。
Why is it so hard to feel sympathy for a developing country that can’t pay its debts?	为何同情无法偿付债务的发展中国家如此困难？
For starters, in 2001, Argentina unilaterally defaulted on its entire $100 billion debt, an unusual step, rather than negotiating new terms with its creditors.	首先，2001年，阿根廷单方面对其全部1,000亿美元债务违了约，而不是与债权人协商新条款，这是颇为反常的。
When, in 2005, the government finally got around to negotiating a debt swap, it could almost dictate the terms – a 70% “haircut.”	2005年，阿根廷政府终于拨冗参与债务互换谈判时，它几乎可以任意指定条件 — — 70%的“剃头 ” （ haircut ） 。
In the intervening decade, President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and her late husband and predecessor, Néstor Kirchner, have pursued a variety of spectacularly bad economic policies.	在此间的十年中，阿根廷总统费尔南德兹·基什内尔及其已故丈夫兼前任总统捏斯托·基什内尔实施了一系列糟糕透顶的经济政策。
The independence of the central bank and the statistical agency have been severely compromised, with Fernández forcing the adoption, for example, of a consumer price index that grossly understates the inflation rate.	中央银行和统计部门的独立性遭到了严重破坏，比如，费尔南德兹强迫采取了严重低估通胀率的消费物价指数。
Contracts have been violated and foreign-owned companies have been nationalized.	契约被恣意破坏，外资公司被国有化。
And when soaring global prices for Argentina’s leading agricultural commodities provided a golden opportunity to boost output and raise chronically insufficient foreign-currency earnings, Fernández imposed heavy tariffs and quotas on exports of soy, wheat, and beef.	而当主产农作物全球价格飙升为阿根廷提供了提振产出、增加长期不足的外汇收入时，费尔南德兹又给大豆、小麦和牛肉出口施加了沉重的关税。
Some might counter that the holdout hedge funds that sued Argentina deserve no sympathy, either.	也许会有人反驳说，起诉阿根廷的顽固坚持对冲基金也不值得同情。
Many are called “vulture funds” because they bought the debt at a steep discount from the original creditors, hoping to profit subsequently through court decisions.	许多这样的基金被称为“兀鹫基金 ” ， 因为它们以深度折价从原始债权人手中购买债务，期望通过法院裁决斩获丰厚利润。
But the problem with the Argentine debt case has little to do with the moral failings of either the plaintiffs or the defendant.	但阿根廷债务案的问题关税或被告的道德失当没有关系。
The problem is the precedent that the case establishes for resolving future international debt crises.	问题在于该案为解决未来国际债务危机所树立的先例。
The most common reaction to the recent rulings is pro-holdout.	对最新判决的最常见反应是支持顽固坚持。
After all, the judge is only enforcing the legal contract embodied in the original bonds, isn’t he?	毕竟，法官只不过是在强制执行初始债券中所包含的法律契约，不是吗？
As President Calvin Coolidge supposedly said of the American loans to the World War I allies, “They hired the money, didn’t they?”	据说美国总统柯立芝这样评价美国对一战协约国的贷款 ： “ 它们租用了钱，不是吗 ？ ”
If only the world were so simple.	要是世界如此简单就好了。
If only a regime of consistent enforcement of all loan contracts’ explicit terms were sufficiently practical to be worth pursuing.	要是一致执行所有贷款契约的明白条款的机制足够实用、值得追求就好了。
But we have long since recognized the need for procedures to rewrite the terms of debt contracts under extreme circumstances.	但我们早就认识到需要依靠程序重写极端情形下的贷款契约条件。
The British Joint Stock Companies Act of 1856, for example, established the principle of limited liability for corporations.	比如，1856年英国合股公司法（Joint Stock Companies Act）规定了公司的有限责任原则。
Indentured servitude and debtors’ prisons have also been illegal since the nineteenth century.	自十九世纪以来，卖身契和债务人监狱也变为非法。
And individuals and corporations can declare bankruptcy.	个人和公司可以宣布破产。
There will always be times when it is impossible for a debtor to pay.	总有债务人无法偿还的时候。
As for corporate bankruptcy, it is recognized that a poor legal system is one that keeps otherwise viable factories shuttered while assets are frittered away in expensive legal wrangling, leaving everyone – managers, workers, and shareholders – worse off.	而对于公司破产，我们已经意识到，在糟糕的法律体系中，本可以存活的工厂倒闭，而资产在昂贵的法律扯皮中灰飞烟灭，所有人 — — 管理者、工人和股东 — — 都遭受损失。
A good legal system permits employment and production to continue in cases where the economic activity is still viable; divides up the remaining assets in an orderly and generally accepted way; and makes these determinations as efficiently and speedily as possible, while discouraging future carelessness by imposing costs on managers, shareholders, and – if necessary – creditors.	而良好的法律体系让招聘和生产在经济活动仍然可行时能够继续；以有序的、能被总体接受的方式分割剩余资产；并以尽可能快的速度和尽可能高的效率做出决定，同时通过让管理者、股东以及 — — 如有必要的话 — — 债权人承担代价，以阻止未来的不审慎行为。
No such body of law exists at the international level.	在国际层面不存在这样一个法律体系。
Some believe that this vacuum is the primary difficulty with the international debt system.	有人认为这一真空是国际债务体系的主要难点。
Ambitious proposals to redress it, such as a Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism (SDRM) housed at the International Monetary Fund, have always run into political roadblocks.	雄心勃勃的解决方案，如国际货币基金组织（IMF）所属的主权债务重组机制（Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism，SDRM ） ， 总是陷入政治障碍。
But incremental steps had been slowly moving the system in the right direction since the 1980s.	但自20世纪80年代以来，实质步骤一开始逐渐将体系推向正确的方向。
In the international debt crisis that began in 1982, IMF country adjustment programs went hand in hand with “bailing in” creditor banks through “voluntary” coordinated loan rollovers.	在肇始于1982年的国际债务危机中，IMF国家调整计划与通过“自愿”合作贷款展期进行的债权人“自救 ” （ bailing in）双管齐下。
Eventually, it was recognized that a debt overhang was inhibiting investment and growth in Latin America, to the detriment of debtors and creditors alike.	最终，人们意识到是债务积压制约了拉丁美洲的投资与增长，债务人和债权人都受到了伤害。
Subsequent programs to deal with emerging-market crises featured an analogous combination of country adjustment and “private sector involvement.”	此后处理新兴市场危机的计划都有类似的国家调整和“私人部门参与”结合。
Voluntary debt exchanges worked, roughly speaking, with investors accepting haircuts.	总的来说，如果投资者可以接受“剃头 ” ， 自愿债务交换是有效的。
After Argentina’s unilateral default in 2001, many investors saw more clearly the need to allow explicitly for less drastic alternatives ahead of time, and so incorporated so-called “collective action clauses” into debt contracts.	2001年阿根廷单方面违约后，许多投资者更加认清了需要事先明确允许不太极端的替代方案，因此在债务契约中引入了所谓的“集体诉讼条款 ” 。
If the borrower runs into trouble, CACs make it possible to restructure debt with the agreement of a substantial majority of creditors (usually around 70%).	如果债务人陷入麻烦，根据集体诉讼条款，如果绝对多数债权人（通常在70%左右）形成协议，就可以进行债务重组。
The minority is then bound by the agreement.	这样一来，少数派就受到了协议的约束。
Such incremental steps gave rise to a loose system of debt restructuring.	这些实质步骤促成了宽松的债务重组制度。
To be sure, it still had many deficiencies.	诚然，它的缺陷仍然很多。
Restructuring often came too late and provided too little relief to restore debt sustainability.	重组往往来得太晚，提供的纾困也不足以重塑债务可持续性。
But it worked, more or less.	但它多多少少是有效的。
By contrast, the US court rulings’ indulgence of a parochial instinct to enforce written contracts will undermine the possibility of negotiated re-structuring in future debt crises.	相反，美国法院裁决囿于狭隘的执行书面契约本能，破坏了未来债务危机协商重组的可能性。
Time will run out for Argentina at the end of July.	阿根廷的时间到7月底为止。
Unable to pay all of its debts, perhaps it will be forced to default on all of them.	如果不能偿付所有债务，它就有可能被迫对所有债务违约。
The more likely outcome is that it will manage to come to some accommodation that the holdouts find more attractive than the deal accepted by the other creditors.	更有可能的结果是它设法向顽固坚持者提出比被其他债权人所接受的更有吸引力的建议。
Either way, future voluntary debt-workout agreements have just become more difficult to reach, which will leave debtors and creditors alike worse off.	无论哪种情况发生，未来自愿债务解决方案都会更加难以达成，债务人和债权人都会因此蒙受损失。
	
The Subsidy Trap	补贴陷阱
CAMBRIDGE – Few policies place good economics so directly at odds with good politics as subsidies for food and energy.	美国剑桥—没有哪个政策像食品和能源补贴那样让好经济学如此直接地与好政治学对立起来。
The issue of unaffordable subsidies is now front and center for three of the world’s most important new leaders: Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Indonesian President-elect Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.	无法负担的补贴正在成为三位世界最重要新领导人所面临的的核心问题。 他们是埃及总统西西、印尼总统“佐科维”维多多以及印度总理莫迪。
Sisi is confronting the need to cut subsidies better than might have been expected.	西西所面临的的削减补贴需要比预想中好一些。
Modi, by contrast, is doing worse than expected – even torpedoing a long-anticipated Word Trade Organization agreement.	相反，莫迪面临着比预想更糟糕的局面，甚至有可能破坏期待已久的世贸组织协定。
With Jokowi, it is too soon to tell.	而佐科维面临的局面尚不明朗。
In July, Sisi accomplished what few leaders in North Africa or the Middle East have: he sharply cut longstanding fuel subsidies and allowed prices to rise by 41-78%.	7月，西西完成了北非和中东很少有领导人能够完成的成就：他大幅削减了存在已久的能源补贴，让价格提高了41-78 % 。
Surprisingly, few protests materialized.	令人奇怪的是，几乎没有发生反对示威。
Egypt’s food subsidy program, which costs more than $5 billion a year, is in urgent need of reform as well.	埃及的食品补贴计划每年耗费50亿美元以上，也迫切地需要改革。
The price of bread has been kept so low that it is often fed to animals.	面包价格一直保持在极低水平，以至于常常被拿来喂动物。
Past attempts to reduce such subsidies in North African countries have brought unrest and even toppled governments.	在过去，北非国家削减这类补贴的努力常常引发动乱，甚至颠覆政府。
But the Sisi government appears to be making progress here as well.	但西西政府似乎在这方面也能够取得进展。
Bread subsidies have already been cut by 13%.	面包补贴已经被削减了13 % 。
Sisi had little choice.	西西别无选择。
Even with subsidy cuts, the current government is targeting a budget deficit of 10% of GDP in the coming fiscal year (compared to 14% otherwise).	即使在补贴缩减后，现任政府下一个财年的预算赤字目标仍达到了GDP的10 % （ 若无补贴削减将达到14 % ） 。
Still, few expected Sisi, who took office in a fragile political environment, to move faster than Modi, who was elected with a whopping democratic majority amid hopes for sweeping economic reform.	但是，几乎没人预料到在动荡政治环境中上台的西西能够比莫迪行动更加迅速。 莫迪在迫切希望彻底经济改革的印度通过压倒性民主多数问鼎总理宝座。
In Indonesia, when Jokowi takes office in October, he will inherit a long history of fuel subsidies that, at $21 billion a year (up to 20% of government spending), the country can no longer afford.	在印尼，10月开始执政的佐科维继承的是长期存在的燃料补贴，规模高达每年210亿美元（相当于政府支出的20 % ） ，已令国家不堪重负。
Outgoing President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono took a first courageous step by raising fuel prices a year ago.	下台的苏西洛在一年前已经采取了勇敢的第一步，提高了燃料价格。
Jokowi’s advisers favor cutting the remaining subsidies, and he has already forthrightly said that he plans to do so gradually, over a four-year period.	佐科维的顾问们建议裁减剩下的补贴，而他也直率地表示计划在四年时间里逐步落实。
Economists feel confident in opposing commodity subsidies because agricultural and energy markets tend to approach the ideal of perfect competition, with a large number of consumers on the demand side and producers on the supply side.	经济学家信心十足地反对商品补贴，因为农业和能源市场接近于完美竞争，需求端有大量消费者，供给端有大量生产者。
Where competition is imperfect, government, not large private monopolies, is usually the reason.	在竞争不完美的领域，政府 — — 而不是大型私有垄断商 — — 才是根源。
Critics of the invisible hand point out that, left to themselves, private markets can fail in a number of ways.	看不见的手的批评者指出，自我运转的私人市场可能以各种方式失灵。
For example, income inequality and environmental externalities are two of the most prominent justifications for government intervention.	比如，收入不平等和环境外部性便是政府干预最主要的两大理由。
What is striking about food and fossil-fuel subsidies is that they are often promoted in the name of the environment or equity, but usually do little to achieve these goals, and often have the opposite effect.	让食品和化石燃料补贴引起尖锐争议的是它们常常打着环境或平等的旗号推行，但实际上对于这些目标于事无补，反而常常适得其反。
Less than 20% of Egyptian food subsidies benefit poor people.	埃及食品补贴只有不到20%给了穷人。
Gasoline subsidies in most countries benefit the middle class, while the poor walk or take public transportation.	大部分国家的汽油补贴肥了中产阶级，而穷人依靠步行或公共交通。
In India, less than 0.1% of rural subsidies for Liquefied Petroleum Gas go to the poorest quintile, while 52.6% go to the wealthiest.	在印度，只有不到0.1%的液化石油气补贴给了最贫困人口，倒有52.6%流入了最富人群的口袋。
Worldwide, far less than 20% of fossil-fuel subsidies benefit the poorest 20% of the population.	就全世界而言，只有远不足 20%的化石燃料补贴给了最贫困的20%人口。
Food and energy subsidies can also distort public policy, as Modi’s government, seeking to protect India’s agricultural subsidies, has shown.	食品和能源补贴也有可能扭曲公共政策，意在保护印度农业补贴的莫迪政府就是明证。
Indeed, its veto of a WTO compromise has derailed the most important progress in multilateral trade negotiations of the last ten years.	事实上，莫迪政府否决世贸组织妥协让过去十年多边贸易谈判最重要的进展毁于一旦。
Agricultural subsidies sometimes seek to benefit consumers at the expense of producers, especially in poor countries, and sometimes seek to benefit producers at the expense of consumers, especially in rich countries.	农业补贴有时是康生产商之慨让消费者获益，特别是在穷国；而有时则是康消费者之慨让生产商获益，特别是在富国。
India’s policies try to do both.	印度的政策则以兼而有之为目标。
As a result, India has accomplished the extraordinary feat of rationing grain to consumers at artificially low prices, while simultaneously suffering excess supply, because farmers are paid high prices.	结果，印度完成了一个壮举：以人为压低的价格为消费者配给小麦，同时又经历过度供给，因为农民可以获得高价。
(Farmers are also subsidized via agricultural inputs – electricity, water, and fertilizer – to the detriment of the environment.)	（农民还通过农业投入品 — — 电、水和肥料获得补贴，而环境遭到了破坏。
The government has purchased huge stockpiles of rotting rice and wheat, while the limited amount available to consumers is allocated in ways that are corrupt and inconsistent with the stated goal of helping the poor.	）政府收购了大量腐败稻米和小麦，而消费者所能得到的一小部分的分配方式既腐败又不符合帮助穷人的目标。
The government would like to keep its subsidies and stockpiles.	政府可能会继续保持补贴和收储。
But it knows that this would violate WTO rules.	但它知道，这会违反世贸组织规则。
Unable to obtain a permanent change in these rules, Modi vetoed the WTO’s eagerly anticipated Trade Facilitation Agreement.	既然无法永久地改变这些规则，莫迪干脆否决了世贸组织热切期待的贸易促进协定（Trade Facilitation Agreement ） 。
Once subsidies are in place, they are extraordinarily difficult to remove.	一旦补贴实施，就很难收回。
When world commodity prices rise, as they often have over the last decade, citizens who are accustomed to the domestic price being set in the market are more likely to accept the reality that officials cannot insulate them from the shock.	当世界商品价格上涨时（如过去十年那样 ） ， 习惯于市场决定的国内价格的公民更有可能接受官员无法将他们与冲击隔离开来的现实。
But people who are accustomed to administratively established food and energy prices hold the government responsible.	但习惯于官定食品和能源价格的人民会要求政府负责。
That is a strong reason not to adopt such subsidies in the first place.	这就构成了一个很强的理由，从一开始就不应该实施补贴。
But it does not necessarily mean that, once subsidies are in place, keeping them is a savvy politician’s best option.	但这并不意味着一旦补贴实施，保持补贴就一定是精明政客的最佳选择。
If the alternative to raising the price is shortages or rationing, angry protesters may mobilize anyway.	如果涨价的替代方案是短缺或配给，愤怒的反对者也有可能爆发。
Similarly, the procrastinating leader is unlikely to benefit if ever-widening gaps force an even bigger retail-price rise when the day of reckoning comes.	类似地，如果不断扩大的差距最终导致更大的零售价格攀升，那么动作缓慢的领导人也不可能得到好处。
Ideally, other, more efficient means of supporting incomes at the bottom will be instituted at the same time that food and energy subsidies are cut.	在理想情况下，在裁减食品和能源补贴的同时，应该采取其他更高效的支持底层收入的措施。
Developing countries have learned a lot about efficient transfer mechanisms, from policy innovations, such as the conditional cash transfers of Mexico’s Progresa-Oportunidades program or Brazil’s Bolsa Família, and from technological innovations such as India’s Unique Identification system.	发展中国家在有效转移机制方面已颇有学习经验，如墨西哥的进步-机会计划（Progresa-Oportunidades）和巴西的家庭补助金计划（Bolsa Família）等有条件现金转移支付政策创新，以及印度的唯一标识（Unique Identification）系统等技术创新。
But in countries where the adjustment does not come until a budget crisis forces it, there may be no money for transfers to cushion the pain.	但有的国家在预算危机来临是才被迫调整，它们也许没有钱可用于转移支付以将对痛苦。
The savvy politician should probably announce the unpleasant adjustment as soon as he takes office.	精明政客或许应该在执政伊始实施不受欢迎的调整。
Jokowi and Sisi seem to have adopted this approach.	佐科维和西西都采取了这一方针。
Modi, despite his huge electoral mandate and hype about market reforms, has fallen short.	而以市场改革为口号在选举中大获全胜的莫迪已经落后了。
	
China is Still Number Two	中国仍是第二名
CAMBRIDGE – Headlines around the world this week trumpeted a watershed moment for the global economy.	纽约剑桥—本周，世界各大媒体纷纷抛出全球经济分化时刻论。
As the Financial Times put it, “China poised to pass US as world’s leading economic power this year.”	《金融时报》说 ： “ 今年中国就将超过美国成为世界第一经济大国 。 ”
This is a startling development – or it would be if the claim were not essentially wrong.	这是一个令人吃惊的趋势 — — 如果这一论断不错得离谱的话。
In fact, the United States remains the world’s largest national economy by a substantial margin.	事实上，美国仍以相当大的优势稳坐世界第一大国家经济体宝座。
The story was based on the April 29 release of a report from the World Bank’s International Comparison Program.	整个故事的起源是4月29日世界银行国际比较项目（International Comparison Program，ICP）发布的一份报告。
The ICP’s work is extremely valuable.	ICP的工作很有价值。
I eagerly await and use their new estimates every six years or so, including to look at China.	每隔六年，我都会翘首期待使用其新的估计结果，包括关于中国的结果。
The ICP data compare countries’ GDP using purchasing-power-parity (PPP) exchange rates, rather than market rates.	ICP的数据使用购买力平价汇率（PPP）而非市场汇率比较各国GDP。
This is the right thing to do when looking at real (inflation-adjusted) income per capita in order to measure people’s living standards.	如果要比较真实（经通胀调整的）人均收入以测量人民的生活水平，这样比较是正确的。
But it is the wrong thing to do when looking at national income in order to measure the country’s weight in the global economy.	但若要衡量国民收入以测量一国在全球经济中的分量，这样比较是错误的。
The bottom line is that, by either criterion – per capita income (at PPP exchange rates) or aggregate GDP (at market rates) – the day when China surpasses the US remains in the future.	基本要点在于，以两种标准算 — — 人均收入（以PPP汇率衡量）和总GDP（以市场汇率衡量 ） — —中国超越美国的时刻都在未来。
This in no way detracts from the country’s impressive growth record, which, at about 10% per year for three decades, constitutes a historical miracle.	这并不是说中国令人印象深刻的增长记录不重要 — — 以10%左右的速度连续增长三十年，这绝对是一个历史奇迹。
At market exchange rates, the American economy is still almost double the size of China’s (83% larger, to be precise).	按市场汇率，美国经济仍比中国大几乎一倍（准确地说是大83 % ） 。
If the Chinese economy’s annual growth rate remains five percentage points higher than that of the US, with no significant change in the exchange rate, it will take another 12 years to catch up in total size.	如果中国经济年增长率保持比美国高五个百分点的水平并且汇率不发生重大变化，那么还要12年才能从总规模上赶超美国。
If the differential is eight percentage points – for example, because the renminbi appreciates at 3% a year in real terms – China will surpass the US within eight years.	如果两国增长率之差达到八个百分点 — — 比如由于人民币每年以3%的速度实际升值 — — 中国将在八年内赶超美国。
The PPP-versus-market-exchange-rate issue is familiar to international economists.	PPP和市场汇率之争对国际经济学家来说并不陌生。
This annoying but unavoidable technical problem arises because China’s output is measured in renminbi, while US income is measured in dollars.	这一令人厌倦但不可回避的技术性问题产生的原因在于中国的产出以人民币计算，而美国收入以美元计算。
How, then, should one translate the numbers so that they are comparable?	那么，我们应该如何换算数字以使它们变得可比？
The obvious solution is to use the contemporaneous exchange rate – that is, multiply China’s renminbi-measured GDP by the dollar-per-renminbi exchange rate, so that the comparison is expressed in dollars.	一个明显的办法是使用当时的汇率 — — 即把中国的人民币GDP乘以美元兑人民币汇率，从而以美元单位比较两者。
But then someone points out that if you want to measure Chinese citizens’ standard of living, you have to take into account that many goods and services are cheaper there.	但随后有人提出，如果你想衡量中国人民的生活水平，你必须考虑许多在中国更廉价的商品和服务。
A renminbi spent in China goes further than a renminbi spent abroad.	花在中国的人民币比花在外国的人民币值钱。
For this reason, if you want to compare per capita income across countries, you need to measure local purchasing power, as the ICP does.	基于这一理由，如果你想比较不同国家的人均收入，就需要用当地购买力平价衡量，ICP就是这么做的。
The PPP measure is useful for many purposes, such as knowing which governments have succeeded in raising their citizens’ standard of living.	PPP在很多方面很有用，如了解那些政府在提高人民生活水平方面取得了成功。
Looking at per capita income, even by the PPP measure, China is still a relatively poor country.	在人均收入方面，即使用PPP很像，中国仍是相对贫穷国家。
Though it has come very far in a short time, its per capita income is now about the same as Albania’s – that is, in the middle of the distribution of 199 countries.	尽管中国的人均收入在短时间内上涨了很多，但现在仍和阿尔巴尼亚相当 — — 即位列199个国家的中游。
But Albania’s economy, unlike China’s, is not often in the headlines.	但和中国不同，阿尔巴尼亚经济很少吸引媒体眼球。
That is not only because China has such a dynamic economy, but also because it has the world’s largest population.	这不仅是因为中国经济充满着活力，也是因为它拥有世界最大人口。
Multiplying a middling per capita income by more than 1.3 billion “capita” yields a big number.	将中等人均收入乘以13亿多“人口 ” ， 就产生了一个巨大的数字。
The combination of a large population and a medium income gives it economic power, and also political power.	大人口和中等收入的结合给了中国经济实力，也给了它政治实力。
Similarly, we consider the US the number-one incumbent power not just because it is rich.	类似地，我们之所以将美国视为在任第一号强国，不仅是因为它富有。
If per capita income were the criterion by which to judge, Monaco, Qatar, Luxembourg, Brunei, Liechtenstein, Kuwait, Norway, and Singapore would all rank ahead of the US.	如果人均收入可以作为评判标准，那么摩纳哥、卡塔尔、卢森堡、文莱、列支敦士登、科威特、挪威和新加坡都比美国排名靠前。
(For the purposes of this comparison, it does not matter much whether one uses market exchange rates or PPP rates.)	（对于这项比较，使用市场汇率还是PPP汇率并不十分重要。
If you are shopping for citizenship, you might want to consider one of those countries.	）如果你要选购公民身份，或许会想要这些国家中的一个。
But we do not consider Monaco, Brunei, and Liechtenstein to be among the world’s “leading economic powers,” because they are so small.	但我们不会考虑把摩纳哥、文莱和卢森堡作为世界“领先经济大国 ” ， 因为它们太小了。
What makes the US the world’s leading economic power is the combination of its large population and high per capita income.	让美国成为世界领先经济大国的是其庞大的人口和高人均收入的组合。
It is this combination that explains the widespread fascination with how China’s economic size or power compares to America’s, and especially with the question of whether the challenger has now displaced the long-reigning champion.	这一组合解释了为何将中国经济规模或实力与美国相比较是一件令人如此兴奋的事，特别是挑战者现在是否能够取代长期领先者这一问题。
But PPP exchange rates are not the best tool to use to answer that question.	但PPP汇率不是回答这一问题的最佳工具。
The reason is that when we talk about an economy’s size or power, we are talking about a broad range of questions – and a broad range of interlocutors.	原因在于，当我们谈论一国的规模或实力时，我们谈论的是一系列范围很广的问题 — — 以及一系列范围很广的对话者。
From the viewpoint of multinational corporations, how big is the Chinese market?	从跨国公司的角度看，中国市场有多大？
From the viewpoint of global financial markets, will the RMB challenge the dollar as an international currency?	从全球金融市场角度看，人民币能挑战美元的国际货币地位吗？
From the viewpoint of the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral agencies, how much money can China contribute, and how much voting power should it get in return?	从国际货币基金组织和其他多边机构角度看，中国可以贡献多少资金？ 应该回馈给中国多大的投票权？
From the viewpoint of countries with rival claims in the South China Sea, how many ships can its military buy?	从在南海立场上不同的国家看，中国海军可以买多少艘舰艇？
For these questions, and most others involving total economic heft, the indicator to use is GDP at market exchange rates, because what we want to know is how much the renminbi can buy on world markets, not how many haircuts or other local goods it can buy back home.	对于这些问题以及其他与总体经济实力相关问题看，有用的指标是市场汇率GDP，因为我们想知道的是人民币可以在世界市场上买到多少东西，而不是人民币可以在国内理多少次发、买多少国产货。
And the answer to that question is that China can buy more than any other country in the world – except the US.	而这一问题的答案是，中国比世界任何其他国家买的东西都要多 — — 除了美国。
	
Piketty’s Missing Rentiers	皮克提忽略的吃租者
CAMBRIDGE – Most reviews of Thomas Piketty’s book Capital in the Twenty-First Century have already been written since its startling rise to the top of bestseller lists in April.	美国剑桥—大部分关于托马斯·皮克提（Thomas Piketty）的《二十一世纪资本论 》 （ Capital in the Twenty-First Century）的书评是在4月份该书一炮而红、登上畅销书榜首时写的。
But I thought it wise to read the volume in its entirety before offering my thoughts.	但我认为，明智的做法是先通读全书，在给出感想。
It has taken me five months, but I have finally finished it.	我花了五个月读这本书，好歹是读完了。
One thing that the book has in common with Karl Marx’s Capital is that it serves as a rallying point for those concerned about inequality, regardless of whether they understand or agree with Piketty’s particular argument.	该书与马克思的《资本论 》 （ Capital）的一个共同点是，它成了召集担心不平等性的人的一面旗帜，不管他们是否理解或同意皮克提的具体观点。
To be fair, whereas very little of what Marx wrote was based on carefully collected economic statistics, and much of it was bizarre, much of what Piketty writes is based on carefully collected economic statistics, and very little of it is bizarre.	平心而论，尽管马克思的著作很少具有仔细搜集的经济数据作为支撑，并且许多内容堪称海外奇谈，但皮克提著作的大部分内容建立在仔细搜集的经济数据的基础上，很少有海外奇谈。
In the United States, income inequality by most measures has been rising since 1981, and by 2007 had approximately re-attained its early-twentieth-century peak.	在美国，大部分不平等性指标自1981年以来都在上升，2007年几乎已经达到20世纪初的最高水平。
The same is true in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.	英国、加拿大和澳大利亚也是如此。
In these countries, income inequality declined sharply from 1914 to 1950, as it did in France, Germany, Japan, and Sweden.	在这些国家，收入不平等性在1941—1950年期间迅速下降，法国、德国、日本和瑞典也是如此。
But in the latter group, the income distribution is now far more egalitarian than it was at peak inequality a hundred years ago.	但后几个国家目前的收入分配比一百年前不平等性最严重的时候平均得多。
Economists, at least in the US, have focused on several causes of the increase in inequality.	经济学家，至少是美国经济学家，关注着不平等性上升的几个原因。
First, there is the wage difference between “skilled” and “unskilled” workers, defined according to their educational attainment.	首先 ， “ 高技能 ” （ skilled）和“低技能”工人（根据教育程度划分）之间有工资差异。
Here, higher wages are often agreed to reflect the economic value of skills appropriate to an increasingly technological economy, and the question is how to improve workers’ skills.	在这里，一个共识是高工资往往反映了适应日益高科技的经济的技能的经济价值，而问题在于如何改进工人的技能。
Second, there is the high compensation of corporate executives and people in finance.	其次，公司高管和金融业者的薪酬很高。
The financial crisis of 2008 left many observers understandably doubtful of claims that this compensation is a return to socially valuable activities.	容易理解，2008年金融危机让许多观察家质疑如此高薪酬是有社会价值的活动的回报的观点。
Third, there is the winner-take-all character of many professions.	第三，许多职业表现出赢家通吃的特征。
In a society that can identify the best dentist in town or the best football player in the world, relatively small differences in abilities win far bigger differences in income than they used to.	在一个可以区分城里最好的牙医和全球最好的足球选手的社会，能力上的相对较小的差距会导致收入上的比过去大得多的差异。
Finally, there is “assortative mating”: highly accomplished professional men now marry highly accomplished professional women.	最后是“门当户对 ” ， 高成就的职业男性与高成就的职业女性结婚。
Piketty focuses on none of these sources of inequality, all of which are related to “earned income” (wages and salaries).	皮克提不关心所有这些不平等性的根源，它们都是关于“赚得收入 ” （ earned income工资和薪水）的。
Rather, his central concern is what he regards as a twenty-first-century trend toward inequality of wealth, brought about by the steady accumulation of savings among the better off, which are then passed down, with accumulated interest, from one generation to the next.	相反，皮克提的核心关注点是他所谓的二十一世纪趋势 — — 财富不平等性，这种不平等性来自较富有人群的储蓄积累，他们的储蓄连同累计利息代代相传。
It is true that capital’s share of income (interest, dividends, and capital gains) rose gradually in major rich countries during the period 1975-2007, while labor’s share (wages and salaries) fell, a trend that would support Piketty’s hypothesis if it continued.	诚然，1975—2007年间，主要发达国家资本的收入部分（利息、红利和资本利得）逐渐增加，劳动部分（工资和薪水）逐渐下降，如果这一趋势持续，就支持皮克提的假说。
Piketty deserves credit for pointing out the lack of a foundation supporting assertions that capital’s share will necessarily revert to a long-run constant.	皮克提的确做出了贡献，他指出，资本的各成分比例趋于长期稳定值的主张没有支撑基础。
But interest rates have been at all-time lows in recent years – virtually zero.	但利率在近几年中一直保持历史最低水平 — — 几乎为零。
And the claim that in the long run the interest rate must be substantially greater than the economic growth rate is absolutely central to Piketty’s book.	而长期而言利率必须显著高于经济增长率的观点是皮克提著作的绝对核心。
That said, Piketty’s vision is focused squarely on the truly long run: century-long trends, not decade-long fluctuations.	如此看，皮克提的着眼点完全是真正的长期 — — 以世纪为单位的长期趋势，而不是以十年为单位的波动。
For example, the recent global financial crisis runs counter to his ultra-long-run hypothesis: his statistics clearly show a discrete fall in inequality and in capital’s share in 2008-09, because asset prices plummeted.	比如，当前的全球金融危机就有悖于他的超长期假说：他的数据明白无误地表明，2008—2009年不平等性出现了零散的下降，资本比例亦然 ， ， 因为资产价格出现了暴跌。
But, from the perspective of his analysis, this is a historical blip.	但是，从他的分析角度看，这只是历史的暂时现象。
Three century-long movements constitute the essence of the book: a rise in inequality in the nineteenth century, a fall in inequality in the twentieth century, and a predicted return to historically high inequality in the twenty-first century.	三个世纪长的运动构成了该书的基础：十九世纪不平等性的升高，二十世纪不平等性的降低，以及预言二十一世纪不平等性回归历史高峰。
Piketty argues convincingly – not just with statistics, but also with references to Honoré de Balzac and Jane Austen – that the first increase in inequality in France and Britain, mostly from 1800 to 1860, took the form of capital accumulation.	皮克提令人信服地指出 — — 不仅有统计数据，还参考了巴尔扎克和简·奥斯丁 — — 法国和英国的首次不平等性上升（主要在1800—1860年）形���为资本积累。
A small group of rich rentiers lived off their interest; the rest had to work for a living.	一小撮富有的吃租者（rentier）靠利息过活；其他人则需要工作谋生。
The most dramatic movement in Piketty’s graphs is the second one, the sharp fall in inequality in the period 1914-1950.	在皮克提的图表中，最戏剧性的运动是第二张，即1941—1950年不平等性的显著下降。
This is attributable to the destruction of capital – owing to two world wars, the 1929 stock-market crash, and inflation – as well as an historic move toward big government and progressive taxation.	这被归因于资本的毁灭 — — 拜两次世界大战、1929年股市崩盘和通货膨胀所赐 — — 以及趋向大政府和累进税制的历史运动。
What is surprisingly scarce in Piketty’s data is evidence that the third movement – the renewed upswing in inequality that started around 1980 – is due to a shift from labor back to capital.	皮克提的数据所极度缺乏的是第三次运动 — — 不平等性再次上升，始于1980年前后 — — 源于劳动力衰落、资本复兴的证据。
The share of capital income in the UK and France remains far lower than it was in 1860.	法国的资本收入比例仍远低于1860年。
The increases in various measures of inequality since the 1970s have had more to do with shifts within labor’s share (between different categories of earned income) than with wealth.	20世纪70年代以来各种不平等性指标的上升更多地与劳动力内部比例变化（不同赚得收入类别之间）而不是财富有关。
Today’s rich work, unlike those in the Balzac-Austen era.	今天的富人需要工作，而巴尔扎克-奥斯丁时代不需要。
Thus, Piketty’s hypothesis is more a prediction of the future than an explanation for the past or an analysis of a recent trend.	因此，皮克提的假说更多地是对未来的预测，而不是对过去的解释或对现有趋势的分析。
It is a prediction that interest rates will rise substantially above the growth rate, capital will accumulate, and the rich will get richer through inheritance and capital income, rather than through outlandish salaries and stock options.	在这个预测中，利率将升高到显著高于增长率的水平，资本会继续积累，富人会通过继承和资本收入而不是通过离谱的薪水和股票期权变得更富。
For all of Piketty’s impressive historical data, his prediction is based mainly on a priori reasoning: income distribution must tend to inequality because savings accumulate.	皮克提的历史数据令人印象深刻，但其预测主要基于先验的推理：因为储蓄的积累，收入分配必然倾向于不平等。
But one could just as easily find a priori grounds for predicting that countervailing forces will emerge if the gap between rich and poor continues to grow.	但你可以同样轻松地做出先验性预测：如果贫富差距继续扩大，制约力量就会崛起。
Democracy is one such force.	民主就是这种力量之一。
After all, the rise of progressive taxation in the twentieth century followed the excesses of the Belle Époque.	毕竟，二十世纪累进税制的出现就是在一战前的美好时代的荒淫无度之后。
A few years ago, the US reduced federal taxes on capital income and phased out the estate tax, benefiting only the upper 1% – moves widely viewed as demonstrating the political power of the rich.	几年前，美国降低了资本收入的联邦税，并逐步取消了房地产遗产税，这只能让最顶层1%获益 — — 被广泛视为富人炫耀政治权力。
But imagine that in the future we lived in a Piketty world, where inheritance and unearned income fueled stratospheric income inequality.	但想象一下皮克提世界中的未来：遗产和非赚得收入导致收入不平等性一飞冲天。
Could a majority of the 99% still be persuaded to vote against their self-interest?	99%的大多数还能被说服投出不利于其自身利益的选票吗？
	
Why the ECB Should Buy American	欧洲银行应该买美国
CAMBRIDGE – The European Central Bank needs to ease monetary policy further.	美国剑桥—欧洲央行需要进一步宽松货币政策。
Eurozone-wide inflation, at 0.8%, is below the target of “close to 2%,” and unemployment in most countries remains high.	泛欧元区通胀（0.8 % ） 低于“近2 % ” 的目标，大部分国家的失业率也依然高企。
Under current conditions, it is hard for the periphery countries to reduce their costs to internationally competitive levels, as they need to do.	在当前环境下，外围国很难让成本降至具有所需的国际竞争力的水平。
If inflation in the eurozone as a whole is below 1%, the periphery countries are condemned to suffer painful deflation.	如果欧元区整体通胀低于1 % ， 则外围国必将遭遇痛苦的通缩。
The question is how the ECB can ease policy, given that short-term interest rates are already close to zero. Most of the talk in Europe concerns proposals to undertake quantitative easing (QE), following the path taken by the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan.	问题在于，在短期利率已经接近于零的情况下，欧洲央行该如何放松货币政策，欧洲的大部分观点提出应该步美联储和日本银行的后尘采取量化宽松（QE ） 。
This would mean expanding the money supply by buying member countries’ government bonds – a realization of ECB President Mario Draghi’s “outright monetary transactions” scheme, announced in August 2012 in the midst of growing uncertainty about the euro’s future (but never used since then).	这意味着购买成员国政府债券以扩大货币供给，即实现欧洲央行行长德拉吉2012年8月在欧元区未来不确定性日增背景下提出（但从未真正动用过）的“直接货币交易”机制。
But QE would present a problem for the ECB that the Fed and other central banks do not face.	但QE会给欧洲央行带来美联储和其他央行不会面临的问题。
The eurozone has no centrally issued and traded Eurobond that the central bank could buy.	欧元区没有集中发行和交易的欧元债券可供欧洲央行购买。
(And the time to create such a bond has not yet come.)	（并且这种债券何时能成为现实还是未知数。
By purchasing bonds of member countries, the ECB would be taking implicit positions on their individual creditworthiness.	）如若购买成员国债券，欧洲央行就相当于间接肯定或否定了个别国家的信用。
That idea is not popular with the eurozone’s creditor countries.	这一方案在欧元区债权国并不受支持。
In Germany, ECB purchases of bonds issued by Greece and other periphery countries are widely thought to constitute monetary financing of profligate governments, in violation of the treaty under which the ECB was established.	在德国，欧洲央行购买希腊和其他外围国发行的债券的操作被广泛认为是向放纵政府提供货币融资，违反了欧洲央行据以建立的条约。
The German Constitutional Court believes that the OMT scheme exceeds the ECB’s mandate, though it has temporarily tossed that political hot potato to the European Court of Justice.	德国宪法法院认为，直接货币交易超越了欧洲央行的权限范围，尽管它暂时地把这个烫手的政治山芋抛给了欧洲法院。
The legal obstacle is not merely an inconvenience; it also represents a valid economic concern about the moral hazard that ECB bailouts present for members’ fiscal policies in the long term.	政治障碍不仅在于不方便，也彰显出一个合理的经济担忧，即欧洲央行的援助会造成成员国长期财政政策的道德风险。
That moral hazard – a subsidy for fiscal irresponsibility – was among the origins of the Greek crisis in the first place.	这一道德风险 — — 对不负责任的财政的补贴 — — 正是当初希腊危机的根源。
Fortunately, interest rates on Greek and other periphery-country debt have fallen sharply over the last two years.	幸运的是，希腊和其他外围国债务的利率在过去两年里有了大幅下降。
Since he took the helm at the ECB, Draghi has brilliantly walked the fine line required to “do whatever it takes” to keep the eurozone intact.	自德拉吉入主欧洲央行以来，他起到好处地“竭尽全力”保持着欧元区的完整。
(After all, there would be little point in upholding pristine principles if doing so resulted in a breakup, and fiscal austerity alone was never going to return the periphery countries to sustainable debt paths.)	（毕竟，如果坚持最初的原则造成欧元区解体，那么坚持也就毫无意义了，而财政紧缩决不可能让外围国重回可持续增长之路。
At the moment, there is no need to support periphery-country bonds, especially if it would flirt with illegality.	）现阶段，没有必要支持外围国债券，特别是这样做有违规之嫌时。
What, then, should the ECB buy if it is to expand the monetary base?	那么，如果欧洲央行想要扩张货币基础，应该买什么呢？
For several reasons, it should buy US treasury securities.	出于多条理由，它应该买美国国债。
In other words, it should go back to intervening in the foreign-exchange market.	换句话说，它应该回归干预外汇市场。
For starters, there would be no legal obstacles.	首先，这样做不存在法律障碍。
Operations in the foreign-exchange market are well within the ECB’s remit.	外汇市场操作在欧洲央行的权限范围内。
Moreover, they do not pose moral-hazard issues (unless one thinks of the long-term moral hazard that the “exorbitant privilege” of printing the world’s international currency creates for US fiscal policy).	此外，这样做也不会有道德风险（除非你考虑印刷世界国际储备货币的“过度特权”给美国财政政策造成的长期道德风险。
Finally, ECB purchases of dollars would help push down the euro’s exchange rate against the dollar.	）最后，欧洲央行购买美元有助于欧元对美元贬值。
Such foreign-exchange operations among G-7 central banks have fallen into disuse in recent years, partly owing to the theory that they do not affect exchange rates except when they change money supplies.	近几年来，G-7央行之间再也没有进行过此类外汇操作，部分是因为，在理论上，除非汇率改变了货币供给，否则它们不会干预汇率。
But in this case we are talking about an ECB purchase of dollars that would change the euro money supply.	但在这里，我们讨论的是欧洲央行购买可以改变欧元货币供给的美元。
The increase in the supply of euros would naturally lower their price.	欧元供给的增加自然会拉低欧元的价格。
Monetary expansion that depreciates the currency is more effective than monetary expansion that does not, especially when, as is the case now, there is very little scope for pushing short-term interest rates much lower.	促使汇率贬值的货币扩张比没有这一效果的货币扩张更加有效，特别是在无法进一步降低短期利率的情况下（目前就是如此 ） 。
Depreciation of the euro would be the best medicine for restoring international price competitiveness to the periphery countries and reviving their export sectors.	欧元的贬值是重塑外围国国际价格竞争力和振兴它们的出口部门的最佳办法。
Of course, they would devalue on their own had they not given up their currencies for the euro ten years before the crisis (and if it were not for their euro-denominated debt).	当然，如果在危机发生十年前它们没有为了使用欧元而放弃本国货币（并且它们的债务也不是用欧元计价 ） ， 那么它们还可以自主贬值。
If abandoning the euro is not the answer, depreciation by the entire eurozone is.	如果无法放弃欧元，那么只好让整个欧元区一起贬值。
The euro’s exchange rate has held up remarkably during the four years of crisis.	欧元汇率在危机的四年中令人注目地保持着坚挺。
Indeed, the currency appreciated further when the ECB declined to undertake any monetary stimulus at its March 6 meeting.	事实上，在欧洲央行在3月6日的会议上拒绝采取货币刺激后，欧元还有所升值。
Thus, the euro could afford to weaken substantially.	因此，欧元担得起大幅贬值。
Even Germans might warm up to easy money if it meant more exports.	即使德国也有可能给货币宽松开绿灯，如果这意味着增加出口的话。
Central banks should and do choose their monetary policies primarily to serve their own economies’ interests.	央行应该也确实主要根据自身经济利益选择货币政策。
But proposals to coordinate policies internationally for mutual benefit are fair.	但为了共同利益进行国际政策协调的方案也是公平的。
Raghuram Rajan, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, has recently called for the advanced economies’ central banks to take emerging-market countries’ interests into account via international cooperation.	印度储备银行行长拉古兰·拉詹（Raghuram Rajan）最近呼吁发达经济体央行通过国际合作顾及新兴市场国家的利益。
ECB foreign-exchange intervention would fare well in this regard.	从这个角度讲，欧洲央行的汇率干预能起到很好的作用。
This year, the emerging economies are worried about a tightening of global monetary policy, not the policy loosening that three years ago fueled talk of “currency wars.”	今年，新兴经济体担心的是全球货币政策的紧缩，而不是三年前助长“货币战争”论的政策宽松。
As the Fed tapers its purchases of long-term assets, including US treasury securities, it is a perfect time for the ECB to step in and buy some itself.	随着美联储逐渐退出其长期资产（包括美国国债）买入计划，欧洲央行站出来购买美国国债正当其时。
	
Britain’s Populist Fantasies	英国的民粹主义幻想
LONDON – The election of Jeremy Corbyn as the new leader of the British Labour Party is a reminder that life is rich with paradox.	伦敦 — — 杰瑞米·柯比当选为英国工党新领袖提醒我们生活到处充满了悖论。
Globalization – the web of travel, technology, trade, and information that binds the world ever more closely together – is hardly a new phenomenon.	全球化 — — 即旅行、技术、贸易和信息网络使世界更加紧密地联系在一起 — — 已经不再是什么新闻。
But politics in many developed democracies has lately been disrupted by populist insurgencies seeking to exit this shared reality.	但不少发达民主国家政治近来都遭到拒绝承认这一共同现实的民粹主义叛乱分子的破坏。
What these groups do not seem to recognize is that the alternative they wish for is a fantasy.	上述群体似乎并未意识到他们所心仪的选择仅仅是个幻觉。
From Syriza in Greece to the National Front in France, voters across Europe are being encouraged to believe in a virtual reality shaped by prejudice and uninformed nostalgia.	从希腊激进左翼联盟到法国国民阵线，民粹主义者鼓励欧洲选民相信由偏见和无知的留恋构成的一个虚拟现实。
In the United States, this mood first emerged several years ago, fueling the rise of the Tea Party and now enabling the splenetic presidential campaigns of Donald Trump and other Republican candidates who promise to seal America off from the twenty-first century.	几年前这种情绪在美国的首次出现助长了茶党崛起，现在又导致了唐纳德·特朗普和承诺将美国与21世纪隔绝的其他共和党候选人怨气冲天的总统竞选。
(The promise is to some extent literal: By building walls along the country’s northern and southern borders, the candidates would defend the American dream from outside contamination.)	（某种程度上这是个实际承诺：通过在美国南北边境线上修建隔离墙，候选人将捍卫美国梦想不受外来污染。 ）
The United Kingdom is the latest victim of this fantasy-driven populism.	英国是上述幻想民粹主义的最新受害者。
On the right, we have already suffered the rise of the anti-European, anti-immigrant UK Independence Party, led by the cigarette-smoking, beer-swilling joker Nigel Farage, in whom Britain has found its own version of Silvio Berlusconi, if you can imagine such a thing.	英国现在已经被迫面对反欧洲、反移民的英国独立党的崛起，想象一下，该党领导人是英国版的西尔维奥·贝卢斯科尼，也就是抽着烟卷、喝着啤酒的小丑奈杰尔·法拉奇。
Now the British left has embraced a similar folly.	现在英国左翼也已经出现了类似的愚蠢行为。
The Labour Party’s defeat in May’s general election brought about the resignation of its leader, Ed Miliband, a courteous and intelligent figure who, having abandoned the middle ground once controlled by former Prime Minister Tony Blair, had failed to convince even his own party that he could run the country.	工党五月大选失败导致其领导人、聪明知礼的米利班德辞职，米利班德放弃了前首相布莱尔把持的中立地带，甚至无法说服所在政党自己具备管理国家的能力。
The campaign to choose his successor proceeded throughout the summer.	整个夏天都在竞选其继任者。
On the whole, the search was a pretty dismal business.	总体而言，寻找候选人的过程非常痛苦。
Three respectable, if uninspiring, former ministers vied for the position, but struggled to find a compelling message that connected the party of the left with modern Britain.	三名德高望重却缺乏亮点的前部长争夺这一职位，但却很难找到令人信任的口号把左翼党派和现代英国联系在一起。
Unsure of the right approach, they wavered somewhere between moderation and left-wing nonsense.	因为拿不准正确道路，他们在中庸和左翼胡言乱语间来回摇摆。
Such indecisiveness was not a problem for Corbyn, whose principal distinction in more than three decades in parliament has been voting against his own party more than 500 times on the grounds that its proposals were not socialist enough.	对柯比来说优柔寡断不是问题，他30多年议会生涯最主要的与众不同之处就在于因为提案不够社会化而投票反对自己的政党。
In fact, Corbyn made it onto the ballot only because a few MPs wanted to show that the Labour Party welcomed debate.	事实上，柯比进入表决阶段仅仅因为少数几位议员想向外界表明工党对争论持欢迎态度。
But his passionate advocacy of old-fashioned socialism quickly caught on, breathing new life – and drawing tens of thousands of new members – into a party that had been losing adherents in droves.	但他对老式社会主义的狂热宣传却迅速流行 — — 令成千上万新党员对已失去众多追随者的政党趋之若鹜。
So what exactly are Corbyn’s proposals?	那么柯比的建议究竟是什么？
At home, he would nationalize industries, especially in energy, and raise taxes, especially on business and the wealthy.	他在国内提倡尤其是能源等行业国有化和对企业和富裕群体提高税收。
Any semblance of fiscal prudence would go out the window, with cuts in health, welfare, and education spending being reversed.	任何形式的财政审慎都会被彻底抛弃，并且逆转削减医疗、福利和教育支出。
Trade unions would regain the power they enjoyed before Margaret Thatcher’s reforms in the 1980s.	工会将得到20世纪80年代玛格丽特-撒切尔改革之前曾经有过的权力。
And public-sector workers would become the principal beneficiaries of the country’s spending programs.	而且公共部门从业人员将成为国内支出计划的主要受益者。
In foreign policy, Corbyn would slash defense spending and abandon the UK’s nuclear deterrent.	外交政策方面，柯比将削减国防开支和放弃英国核威慑。
He would blame virtually anything that went wrong in the world on America, which is, in his view, morally equivalent to Russia.	他会将世界上发生的一切问题都归咎于在他看来在道德上可与俄罗斯等量齐观的美国。
If a leader like the late Hugo Chávez, the architect of Venezuela’s “socialist revolution,” emerges, Corbyn would probably be on the next plane to meet him.	如果像已故的委内瑞拉“社会主义革命”设计者雨果·查韦斯那样的领导人出现，柯比很可能会登上下一班飞机去会见他。
Despite his radical views, Corbyn won the battle to lead Labour – and hence Britain’s parliamentary opposition, with nearly 60% of the vote.	尽管观点激进，但柯比赢得了工党领导权 — — 也因此拥有了英国议会反对党近60%的选票。
But Labour will not win a general election under Corbyn – a reality that has caused some Conservatives to respond to his victory as though they had won the lottery.	但工党不会在柯比的领导下赢得大选 — — 某些保守党人也因此在他获胜后表现得像是中了彩票。
In my view, however, no good will come from this insurrection for anyone.	但在我看来，这样的混乱对任何人都没有好处。
First, Corbyn will not be swept out of his job by an early display of public distaste and hostility.	首先，柯比不会因为刚开始出现的公众厌恶和敌意就丢掉工作。
On the contrary, at the outset, he may be able to galvanize many alienated young voters against a government that has earned wary respect but is not much liked.	相反，从一开始他就可能鼓动很多难以融入社会的年轻选民反对赢得了谨慎尊重但却不为人喜爱的政府。
Second, without effective and responsible opposition, governments can become arrogant, careless, and too focused on their own supporters.	其次，如果缺少负责有效的反对势力，政府可能变得傲慢、粗心和过度关注自己的支持者。
In this case, leaders of the Conservative Party’s far-right component are likely to think that they can dispense with offering disciplined support to Prime Minister David Cameron and his policies, because Labour can never win under Corbyn, anyway.	如果是这样，保守党极右翼部分领导人可能认为可以无需为首相戴维·卡梅伦及其政策提供无条件的支持，因为反正工党也不可能在柯比的领导下胜出。
Third, at some time over the next year, the UK will face a referendum over its membership in the European Union.	第三，明年某个时候，英国将为是否保留欧盟成员国资格进行全民公投。
While no one knows the position Corbyn will take on this issue, one can speculate that he, like some of the trade-union bosses who support him, might decide that the EU is a rich man’s club, thereby precluding the much-needed cross-party consensus in favor of continued membership.	虽然没人知道柯比在这个问题上的立场，但却可以推测他像支持他的某些工会老板一样，或许会将欧盟视为富人俱乐部，从而破坏保留欧盟成员国资格所迫切需要的跨党派的共识。
Fourth, Corbyn, who shares many of the political views of the Scottish nationalists, will make it more difficult to manage the question of Scotland’s place in the UK.	第四，与许多苏格兰民族主义者有着相同政治观点的柯比将加大英格兰管理苏格兰地位问题的难度。
Making common cause with the nationalists in policy matters will complicate the question of how best to deal with their constitutional aspirations.	在政策问题上与民族主义者站在一起将使处理其宪法诉求的问题进一步复杂化。
Fifth, there is a danger that the Conservative government, faced with irrational populist forces on both the left and the right, will shrink from its duty to stand up for good values and good sense.	第五，保守党政府面对荒谬的左右翼民粹主义势力从原来的行使职能退而坚持正确价值观的危险性始终存在。
But it is vital that, amid all the make-believe, there are still those who hammer home the simple truth that, no matter how much people wish for it, a country cannot decide simply to stop the world and get off.	但在一切乱象之下，重要的是仍有人坚持一个最简单的真理：即无论人们抱有多么迫切的愿望，一个国家也无法决定让世界停止运转，让自己下车。
Corbyn’s election underscores how many Britons are refusing to accept reality.	柯比的当选表明有太多英国人拒绝接受现实。
It is up to Cameron to end their dangerous reverie.	卡梅伦必须结束他们危险的遐想。
	
Taking Corbynomics Seriously	严肃对待科尔宾经济学
LONDON – Fiscal austerity has become such a staple of conventional wisdom in the United Kingdom that anyone in public life who challenges it is written off as a dangerous leftist.	伦敦—在英国，财政紧缩已成为传统智慧的一大标志，任何敢于在公开挑战这一智慧的人都会被扣上危险的左派的帽子。
Jeremy Corbyn, the current favorite to become the next leader of Britain’s Labour Party, is the latest victim of this chorus of disparagement.	目前最有希望成为英国工党下一任领导人的杰里米·科尔宾（Jeremy Corbyn）便是这一“全民鄙视链”的最新受害者。
Some of his positions are untenable.	他的一些立场确实站不住脚。
But his remarks on economic policy are not foolish, and deserve proper scrutiny.	但他对经济政策的评论并不愚蠢，应该引起恰当的仔细思考。
Corbyn has proposed two alternatives to the UK’s current policy of austerity: a National Investment Bank, to be capitalized by canceling private-sector tax relief and subsidies; and what he calls “people’s quantitative easing” – in a nutshell, an infrastructure program that the government finances by borrowing money from the Bank of England.	科尔宾提出了两个取代英国当前紧缩政策的方案：一是成立一家国家投资银行，通过取消私人部门税收优惠和补贴筹集资本；二是实施他所谓的“人民的量化宽松 ” — —概而言之，即政府从英格兰银行借钱进行基础设施建设。
The first idea is neither extreme nor new.	第一个方案既不极端，也不新鲜。
There is a European Investment Bank, a Nordic Investment Bank, and many others, all capitalized by states or groups of states for the purpose of financing mandated projects by borrowing in the capital markets.	目前我们已经有了欧洲投资银行、挪威投资银行和其他许多投资银行，它们的资本来自国家或国家集团，目的是通过从资本市场借钱为指定项目融资。
The rationale for this type of institution derives from what that great socialist theorist Adam Smith called the state’s responsibility for the “erection and maintenance” of those “public works and institutions,” which, while of great advantage to society, would not profit private enterprise.	成立这类机构的理由可以追溯到伟大的社会主义理论家亚当·斯密所谓的国家有对那些“公共工程和机构”负有“兴建和维护”的责任，这些公共工程对社会非常有利，但无法令私人企业盈利。
In other words, the state should always have an investment function.	换句话说，国家永远都应该承担投资功能。
Delegating that function to a dedicated institution may have advantages for the presentation of the public accounts.	将这一功能委托给专门的机构有利于在公共账户上有所体现。
Today’s particular economic circumstances provide a second reason for establishing a National Investment Bank.	今天特殊的经济环境为成立国家投资银行提供了第二个理由。
In slump or even semi-slump conditions, a higher-than-normal proportion of private savings are held in cash or its nearest equivalent (short-term treasury bills).	在萧条或近乎萧条的环境下，比平常时期更高比例的私人存款亿现金或现金等价物（短期国债）持有。
A National Investment Bank could draw out these “idle savings” by issuing bonds for infrastructure development.	国家投资银行可以通过发行基础设施开发债券利用这些“闲置存款 ” 。
Offering a small premium on government securities, such bonds would likely attract long-term investors like pension funds, which otherwise face zero or even negative real returns.	相对政府债券，这类债券提供较小的溢价，有望吸引退休基金等长期投资者，否则这类投资者将面临零甚至负实际回报。
For example, with a fiscal outlay of €21 billion ($23.3 billion), the European Investment Bank is set to finance investments worth at least €315 billion by 2017.	比如，在财政支出只有210亿欧元的情况下，到2017年，欧洲投资银行需要为至少3,150亿欧元的投资项目融资。
“People’s quantitative easing” is a more unorthodox – and a more interesting – version of this idea.	“人民的量化宽松”是比较非正统 — — 也比较有趣 — — 的观点。
Under conventional quantitative easing (QE), the central bank buys government securities from banks or corporations and relies on the extra cash that it “prints” to stimulate private spending.	在传统量化宽松下，央行从银行或公司买入政府债券，并依靠它所“印”的新增现金刺激私人支出。
But studies suggest that much of this money goes into speculative activity, risking asset bubbles, rather than being channeled into productive investment.	但研究表明这笔资金大量流入了投机活动，有可能引起资产泡沫，而没有被引入生产性投资。
An alternative would be to distribute the central bank’s newly issued money directly to housing associations, local councils, or national or regional investment banks – any organization that could carry out infrastructure projects.	一个替代方案是直接将央行新发货币分配给住房协会、地方委员会或国家或地区投资银行 — — 只要是能进行基础设施投资的组织。
This is what Corbyn proposes.	这就是科尔宾的方案。
This idea of monetary financing of fiscal deficits (borrowing from the central bank, rather than from the bond markets) has a reputable pedigree.	这一用货币给财政赤字融资的想法（从央行而不是债券市场借钱）由来已久。
In a lecture to the Cass Business School in February 2012, Adair Turner, former Chairman of the UK Financial Services Authority, proposed it as an option if further borrowing from the markets were politically or financially impossible.	2012年2月，在卡斯商学院（Cass Business School）的演讲中，英国金融服务局前主席阿代尔·特纳（Adair Turner）指出，如果进一步从市场借钱在政治或金融上不可行，那么这也不失为一个选择。
Corbyn’s proposal, unlike orthodox monetary financing, would not add to the national debt – a major advantage.	科尔宾的方案不同于正统货币融资，它不会增加国民债务 — — 这是其主要优点。
Orthodox QE – let’s call it “monetization one” – is intended to be reversed, with taxation used to raise the money to redeem the government bonds held by the central bank.	正统量化宽松 — — 让我们称之为“货币化一号 ” — —是有逆���操作的打算的，用税收筹集资金回购央行所持有的政府债券。
The expectation of future tax hikes could drive people to save part of the new money, rather than spend it.	未来税收增加的预期可能导致人们将一部分新增资金储蓄起来而不是花掉。
Unorthodox QE (“monetization two”) avoids this problem, because the central bank’s borrowing will not be repaid; central-bank assets net out against government liabilities.	非正统量化宽松 （ “ 货币化二号 ” ） 能避免这一问题，因为央行的借款不需要偿付；央行资产冲抵政府负债。
That is why it should not be excluded a priori.	因此不应该先验地将它排除在外。
There is a strong case for monetization two in the eurozone, which faces zero growth and deflation.	有很好的理由认为面临零增长和通货紧缩的欧元区应该实施货币化二号。
Indeed, while the QE program unveiled by the European Central Bank in January consists mainly of sovereign-debt purchases, the ECB will also buy debt issued by the European Commission and the European Investment Bank – key elements of monetization two.	事实上，尽管欧洲央行在1月所实施的量化宽松计划主要是买入主权债务，但欧洲央行也会购买欧盟委员会和欧洲投资银行发行的债务 — — 这正是货币化二号的关键要素。
It will thus help to finance infrastructure investment.	因此，这有助于为基础设施融资。
But it is hardly the case that the UK economy, currently growing at close to 3% a year, needs a further QE program of any kind right now.	但英国经济并非如此，目前英国经济增长率每年不到3 % ， 需要立刻采取任何形式的进一步量化宽松。
The government can borrow all it wants from the bond markets at near-zero interest rates.	政府可以以近零利率从债券市场借到任何它想借的资金。
Outsourcing such borrowing power to a National Investment Bank is merely a way to signal that any additional borrowing will be used for investment, not for current spending.	将这一借款权外包给国家投资银行只是一个释放信号的办法，表明任何新增借款都会被用于投资，而不会被用于当前支出。
There are two solid arguments for activating such an institution in the UK today.	有两个有根据的理由应该在英国成立这样一个机构。
First, the share of private investment in GDP is still below its pre-crash level of around 11% of GDP.	首先，私人投资占GDP的比重仍低于危机前水平（约为11 % ） 。
This suggests that investors lack confidence in the durability of the recovery.	这表明投资者对于复苏能否持续缺少信心。
Second, depending on the institution’s mandate, a state-led investment program offers a way to rebalance the British economy away from private speculative activity to long-term investment in sustainable growth, and away from the south-east to the midlands and the north of England.	其次，依托该机构取得的权限，国家领导的投资项目提供了一条英国经济再平衡之路，从私人投机性活动向可持续增长的长期投资转型；从东南向中部和北英格兰转型。
In short, it offers a way to address the problem of “private affluence and public squalor” that John Kenneth Galbraith identified in the 1950s.	简言之，它提供了一个办法解决约翰·肯尼斯·加尔布雷斯（John Kenneth Galbraith）在20世纪50年代所发现的 “私人丰裕而公共穷酸”的问题。
Corbyn should be praised, not castigated, for bringing to public attention these serious issues concerning the role of the state and the best ways to finance its activities.	科尔宾将这些事关国家角色以及国家行为最佳融资办法的严肃的问题摆在了公共面前，他应该因此受到赞扬而不是苛责。
The fact that he is dismissed for doing so illustrates the dangerous complacency of today’s political elites.	他为此去职，这一事实表明了当今政治精英的危险的自负。
Millions in Europe rightly feel that the current economic order fails to serve their interests.	数百万欧洲人正确地感觉到当前经济秩序已不再符合他们的利益。
What will they do if their protests are simply ignored?	如果反对被完全忽视，他们会怎么做？
	
Jeremy Lin and the Political Economy of Superstars	林书豪与超级巨星的政治经济学
CAMBRIDGE – The biggest news around Cambridge in recent weeks has been Jeremy Lin, the Harvard economics graduate who has shocked the National Basketball Association by rising overnight from “nowhere” to become a genuine star, leading a losing New York Knicks team to an unlikely string of victories.	发自剑桥 — — 剑桥这几个星期的大新闻都是关于林书豪的，这位哈佛经济学毕业生仿佛在一夜之间从无名小卒崛起成为真正的超级巨星，不但令整个美国国家篮球联盟（NBA）为之一振，也为弱旅纽约尼克斯队带来了一连串的胜利。
Lin’s success is delicious, partly because it contradicts so many cultural prejudices about Asian-American athletes.	林书豪的成功之所以如此令人刮目相看，在很大程度上是因为他打破了人们对亚裔美籍运动员的文化偏见。
Flabbergasted experts who overlooked Lin have been saying things like “he just didn’t look the part.”	那些原本忽视林书豪的专家们纷纷说“他看上去不像那种（能成名的）人 。 ”
Lin’s obvious integrity and graciousness has won him fans outside the sport as well.	而林书豪那种溢于言表的诚恳谦和也为他赢得了许多赛场之外的粉丝。
The whole world has taken note, with Lin being featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated for two consecutive issues. The NBA, which has been trying to build brand recognition and interest in China, is thrilled.	当他连续两期登上《体育画报》的封面时，全世界也为之瞩目，也令致力于在中国树立品牌形象以及关注度的NBA大喜过望。
I confess to being a huge Lin fan.	坦白说，我也是林书豪的粉丝。
Indeed, my teenage son has been idolizing Lin’s skills and work ethic ever since Lin starred on the Harvard team.	事实上，我儿子早在林书豪为哈佛大学队打球的时候就对他的球技和职业道德崇拜不已。
But, as an economist observing the public’s seething anger over the “one percenters,” or individuals with exceptionally high incomes, I also see a different, overlooked facet of the story.	但在以一个经济学家身份观察公众对那“1%的富人”或是收入极高者不断升温的愤怒之时，我也发现了这个成功故事中某些与众不同且被忽视的事实。
What amazes me is the public’s blasé acceptance of the salaries of sports stars, compared to its low regard for superstars in business and finance.	令我吃惊的是公众对体育明星的高昂薪水具有某种近乎漠不关心的认同，却对那些商业或者金融界翘楚评价很低。
Half of all NBA players’ annual salaries exceed $2 million, more than five times the threshold for the top 1% of household incomes in the United States.	大多数NBA篮球名星的年薪都超过200万美元，比进入那1%高收入美国家庭的门槛值还高5倍。
Because long-time superstars like Kobe Bryant earn upwards of $25 million a year, the average annual NBA salary is more than $5 million.	由于象科比·布莱恩特这样的超级明星每年都有近2500万美元进账，因此NBA球员的平均年薪已经超过500万美元。
Indeed, Lin’s salary, at $800,000, is the NBA’s “minimum wage” for a second-season player.	相比之下林书豪的年薪只有80万美元，对于一个第二年打NBA的球员来说只算是“最低工资 ” 。
Presumably, Lin will soon be earning much more, and fans will applaud.	不难想象，林书豪的工资肯定会大涨，而粉丝们也会对此大加赞许。
Yet many of these same fans would almost surely argue that CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, whose median compensation is around $10 million, are ridiculously overpaid.	但这些粉丝中的许多人都肯定会质疑那些花红中位数在1000万美元左右的世界五百强企业CEO们，认为他们收取了极不合理的报酬。
If a star basketball player reacts a split-second faster than his competitors, no one has a problem with his earning more for every game than five factory workers do in a year.	如果一名篮球运动员的动作能比他的对手快那么零点几秒，没人会质疑他打一场球的收入比5名工厂工人的年薪还多。
But if, say, a financial trader or a corporate executive is paid a fortune for being a shade faster than competitors, the public suspects that he or she is undeserving or, worse, a thief.	但如果一个金融交易员或者一个企业主管能令自己的企业比竞争者领先一步，公众却怀疑他/她根本不够格领这份高薪，甚至将其视为小偷。
Economists have long studied the economics of superstars in fields where a company can lever enormously the decisions of a small number of individuals, making them valuable in a way that someone who can, say, chop down trees like the legendary Paul Bunyan, is not.	经济学家们一直都在研究那些经济界巨子，在某些领域中一个企业可以将一小批人的决策极度放大，并使之取得一种即便是传说中的伐木巨人保罗·班扬（Paul Bunyan）这样的个体都无法实现的价值。
But the political economy of what levels of income differences countries will tolerate remains uncharted territory.	但对各国究竟可以容忍何种程度的收入差距的政治经济学研究却依然是一片空白。
Of course, there is a certain logic to the public’s disdain for superstar compensation outside of professional sports and entertainment.	当然，公众对体育娱乐之外的高收入者巨额花红的鄙视背后也有一个较为确定的逻辑。
This is especially the case in some areas of finance that are essentially zero-sum games, in which one person’s gain is another’s loss.	尤其是在某些本质上是零和博弈，一个人赚的钱必定来自他人损失的金融领域。
There are other areas, such as technology, in which someone like Apple’s late founder, Steve Jobs, arguably delivers real innovation and quality, rather than just employing lawyers and lobbyists to maintain a monopoly position.	还有其他领域也是例外，比如科技，就像苹果公司已故的创立者史蒂夫·乔布斯那样能为公众传递货真价实的创新和高质量，而不是雇佣一帮律师和国会游说者来维持自己的垄断地位。
As a basketball fan, I would not describe the sport as a zero-sum game, even though one team wins and one team loses.	作为一个篮球迷，我不会将这项运动视为一种零和博弈，即便某一支队的赢球必然是构筑在另一支队的输球之上的。
The best players have huge creative flair. But so do some “street ball” players who excel in slam-dunk theatrics; perhaps because they are not tall enough to compete, they make almost nothing.	那些最顶尖的球员确实拥有极大的创造性天赋，但其实一些擅长扣篮表演的“街球”运动员也有；或许他们的身高无法跟他人竞争，所以也赚不到什么钱。
Do fans tolerate outsize sports incomes because players are role models?	那么粉丝们是否因为球员所起到的模范作用而容忍他们的巨额收入？
Many certainly are, but not all high-paid sports celebrities are exemplary citizens.	在这方面当然有许多球员以身作则，但不是所有高薪体育明星都是模范公民。
Michael Vick, a star quarterback in the US National Football League, served time in prison for running a vicious dog-fighting operation, and arrests of players on charges ranging from illegal possession of drugs and weapons to domestic battery have been a regular occurrence.	比如美国国家橄榄球联盟（NFL）的明星四分卫迈克尔·维克就由于组织残忍的斗狗比赛而入狱，还经常有一些球员因非法持有毒品/武器或者家庭暴力而被捕。
And, back on the field or court, serious infractions occur all the time.	此外某些严重犯规事件在运动场上也时有发生。
Think of Zinedine Zidane’s infamous head butt in the 2006 football World Cup.	回想2006年世界杯上齐达内对对手的那一记著名的冲顶。
In the NBA itself, a star player, Ron Artest, was suspended for the remainder of the 2004 season after going into the stands and brawling with heckling fans during a game. (Artest has now changed his name to Metta World Peace, perhaps in response.)	还有NBA自己的明星球员罗恩·阿泰斯特（Ron Artest）曾因在2004赛季的一场比赛中冲上观众席与球迷扭打而遭停赛 — — 他如今将自己的名字改成爱·世界和平（Metta World Peace ） ， 或许是为了改过自新吧。
Moreover, sports teams surely lobby governments as aggressively as any big business.	此外，体育运动队对政府的游说肯定跟任何大企业一样无所不用其极。
Professional sport is a legislated monopoly in most countries, with top teams extracting free stadiums and other privileges from host cities.	在大多数国家职业体育都是一个合法垄断的行业，那些著名球队都能从所在城市得到免费运动场或者其他特权。
Indeed, Lin’s story, it should be remembered, grew out of a huge labor dispute between the NBA’s billionaire owners and its millionaire players over division of the league’s nearly $4 billion in annual revenues – more than many countries’ national income.	事实上，请一定要记住林书豪的故事是在NBA亿万富翁球队老板和百万富翁球员之间关于如何分配每年40亿美元收入的争端中凸显出来的 — — 这笔钱可比许多国家的年度GDP还要高。
As the late University of Chicago economist Sherwin Rosen postulated, globalization and changing communication technologies have increasingly made the economics of superstars important in a variety of fields.	正如已故芝加哥大学经济学家舍温·罗森（Sherwin Rosen）所假设的那样，全球化和信息交流技术的变革逐渐令明星经济在许多领域变得重要。
That is certainly true in sports and entertainment, but it is also the case in business and finance.	这在体育和娱乐方面肯定是没错的，但在商业和金融方面其实也是如此。
I wish Lin a long and successful career as a superstar, though he will have already had a huge cultural impact even if his success proves meteoric.	我希望林书豪能有一个持久而光辉的职业生涯，虽然他的迅速串红已经带来了巨大的文化冲击。
One can hope that, as Asian-Americans continue to break barriers in other arenas – they remain under-represented among corporate CEOs, for example – these rising superstars will be greeted with similar acclaim.	我们可以预计，随着亚裔美国人继续在其他竞技场上冲破重重障碍 — — 比如担任企业CEO方面 — — 这些崛起的超级巨星们也会的到同样的赞誉。
If the public is not happy about high superstar incomes, the obvious remedy is to improve the tax system, including for powerful sports-team owners, many of whom benefit from huge tax breaks in their day jobs. Who knows?	如果公众对这些超级明星的高收入感到不满意，最明显的应对方法就是改善税务系统，其中包括许多财鸿势大的运动队老板，谁知道他们中的许多人每天从巨额逃税中赚取了多少好处呢？
With a more level playing field, superstars outside sports and entertainment might find themselves a bit better appreciated.	可见如果能建立一个更公正平等的赛场，体育和娱乐界之外的明星都会发现自己得到了更多的赞赏。
	
Food for All	人皆有食
LONDON – With food prices having doubled in the past decade, food security is back on the international agenda.	伦敦 — — 随着过去十年里食品价格翻了一番，粮食安全问题又重新提上了国际议程。
How can the world produce more to feed the next billion people?	世界怎样才能提高产量再养活10亿人？
How can agricultural yields be raised?	如何才能提高农业产量？
What is the best way to develop aquaculture?	怎样以最佳方式发展水产养殖？
Unfortunately, this focus on the supply side misses half the problem.	遗憾的是，关注供应并没有意识到问题的全部。
The world already produces more than twice the number of calories that the human population requires.	全球卡路里产量已经两倍于人类的需求。
An estimated one-third of global food production is wasted.	据测算全球粮食产量的三分之一遭到了浪费。
In poor countries, food is lost due to inadequate storage and gaps in the supply chain (for example, a lack of refrigeration); in rich countries, food is also wasted in the supply chain, and consumers throw a lot of food away.	贫困国家损失粮食是因为仓储能力匮乏和供应链衔接不善（比方说缺少冷藏设备 ） ； 富裕国家供应链也同样浪费粮食，而且消费者也扔掉大量的食物。
Moreover, in many cases, it is poverty, not lack of food in the market, that drives hunger and nutritional deficiency.	此外，许多时候导致饥饿和营养不良的是贫困，而不是市场上粮食匮乏。
Millions of people simply cannot afford to buy the food that they need, which could still be the case if supply were increased.	成百上千万人根本买不起所需的食物，就算供应量增加情况可能也还是这样。
Fixing the demand side to get nutritious food to the poor – particularly to the mothers and children who are most vulnerable – is one of the most pressing food-security imperatives.	最迫切的粮食安全任务是整顿粮食需求，让穷人、特别是最脆弱的母亲���儿童得到有营养的食物。
A broad range of initiatives can contribute to a solution.	解决问题可以采取一系列举措。
For example, micro-level food security can be enhanced through programs that deliver free meals to vulnerable population groups.	比方说，向弱势群体免费提供餐食的计划可以改善微观层面的粮食安全。
Schemes that provide free meals to schoolchildren not only help to feed the young; they also create an incentive for parents to keep their children in the classroom.	为学童提供免费餐食的计划不仅能养活年轻人；还能鼓励家长让他们的孩子留在课堂上。
Initiatives like these are especially successful when complemented with programs that provide access to clean water, energy, safe cooking stoves, and so on.	类似的举措辅之以推广洁净水、能源、安全厨灶等方面的计划将会尤其成功。
Action to reduce diarrhea – so that children retain the nutritional value of what they eat – is another part of the solution.	另外一种办法是采取行动控制痢疾（这样儿童才能吸收他们摄入的营养 ） 。
Of course, in very poor countries and regions, where people cannot afford to buy food on world markets, the supply side should not be neglected.	当然，在民众无力在世界市场购买粮食的非常贫困的国家和地区，供应方面的问题不应被忽视。
Boosting yields of locally grown staple foods (rather than cash crops) would increase self-sufficiency and strengthen resilience when international food prices are high.	提高当地种植的主食作物（而非经济作物）的产量能够提高自给率，让当地民众更能抵御高企的国际粮价。
At the same time, higher agricultural production must be balanced against the associated ecological and social costs.	同时，必须对提高农业产量及相关生态社会成本进行综合考量。
Output in South America, Southeast Asia, and Central Africa currently is being raised mainly by clearing tropical forests, grasslands, and wetlands.	南美、东南亚、非洲和中非目前主要通过砍伐热带森林、破坏草原和湿地来提高粮食产量。
This approach contributes to climate change, interrupts hydrological cycles, and causes soil degradation, all of which undermine our planet’s ability to produce food in the long term.	这种方法导致气候变化、破坏水循环、造成土壤退化，从而使我们这个星球长期粮食生产能力遭受破坏。
If current trends continue, the majority of the world’s remaining species will be extinct by the end of the century, and it is food production, above all other factors, that has driven the decline.	如果任由目前的趋势继续下去，世界多数现存的生物物种将在本世纪末灭绝，而造成这种局面的虽然也有其他因素，但最主要的还是粮食产量。
More than 80% of all endangered birds and mammals are threatened by unsustainable land use resulting from agricultural expansion.	农业扩张造成的不可持续的土地利用导致80%以上的濒危鸟类和哺乳动物受到威胁。
The lesson is clear: We should focus our attention on making production more efficient, reducing waste, and addressing the problem of unsustainable consumption.	应该吸取的教训显而易见：我们要重点提高粮食生产效率、减少浪费，并杜绝不可持续的粮食消费。
Reducing food waste could save more than $250 billion worldwide – the equivalent of 65 million hectares of agricultural land use – by 2030.	减少粮食浪费到2030年可以在全球范围内节约2500多亿美元，相当于6500万公顷的农地产量。
Building a temperature-controlled supply chain with 30,000 tons of modern storage in China would cost more than $100 million a year for the next 20 years.	在中国建成温控供应链及30,000吨现代仓储设施需要在今后20年内每年保持1亿美元的投入。
Many developing countries simply do not have the money for such up-front investment.	许多发展中国家根本无力进行这样的先期投资。
But, with the right focus and much more modest resources, they could dramatically improve the quality of grain silos where more than 30% of food – typically located close to the rural poor – spoils to the point of being unfit for human consumption.	但只要关注重点恰当，他们可以用少得多的资源大幅提高粮仓质量，避免超过30%的粮食 — — 往往靠近那些贫困的农村人口 — — 变质到不适合人类食用。
There are already some positive trends that should be capitalized on globally.	已经出现了一些积极趋势应当在全球范围内加以利用。
In the past few years, households in the United Kingdom have cut their food waste by 21% and the food industry has trimmed its waste streams by 8%.	过去几年内英国家庭的粮食浪费率降低了21 % ， 食品业废物流则降低8 % 。
The public is more willing to forgo cosmetic perfection: “ugly” fruit and vegetables are the fastest-growing sector of the UK’s fresh-produce market, last year saving 300,000 tons of produce that would otherwise have been wasted for being the wrong shape or size.	公众愿意放弃关注外表的完美 ： “ 丑陋”水果和蔬菜是英国整个生鲜市场增长最快的部门，仅去年一年就节约了300,000吨农副产品，本来这些产品可能因为形状或大小不够完美而被浪费掉。
Much anxiety is directed toward growing demand for meat and dairy products in China and India.	不少人焦虑中国和印度不断增长的肉类及奶制品需求。
But per capita meat consumption in the United States and Europe is still more than three times higher than in either country.	但美欧的人均肉类消费量仍然是这两个国家的三倍还多。
In addition to eating less meat, production of it needs to be more resource-efficient.	除了少吃肉外，肉类生产的资源效率也有待提高。
In the past, cattle, sheep, and goats fed on grass and other energy sources unavailable to humans, while pigs and chickens fed on waste, thus contributing overall to total food availability.	过去牛、绵羊和山羊吃的草和其他能源人类都无法利用，猪鸡则以废物为食，从而有利于提高整体粮食供应量。
Now one-third of all arable land is used to grow crops to feed livestock, not to grow staple crops for people.	现在三分之一的耕地都用来种植庄稼、喂养牲畜，不再用于人类主食的耕种。
The rich buy this food to feed their animals, outbidding the poor who want to buy it to feed their children.	富人购买这些粮食来饲养他们的动物，比想要养活自己子女的穷人出价还高。
The United Nations Environment Program estimates that using more by-products and waste to feed livestock could liberate enough food on the world market to feed an additional three billion people.	联合国环境计划署预测利用更多副产品及废物喂养牲畜可以在世界市场上腾出足够的粮食额外养活30亿人口。
The Pig Idea campaign calls for an end to legislation in the European Union and some US states prohibiting the use of food waste to feed pigs and chickens because of the risk of animal diseases.	猪思想运动呼吁废止欧盟及美国某些州以可能导致动物生病为由禁止用餐厨垃圾饲喂猪鸡的法案。
These risks can be managed effectively through proper treatment systems (as in Japan and South Korea).	相关风险可以通过恰当的治疗系统得到控制（就像日本和韩国一样 ） 。
The environmental, economic, and social benefits would be enormous.	由此带来的环境、经济和社会效益将十分巨大。
The earth is capable of feeding everyone.	地球有能力养活所有的物种。
Failing to address problems affecting supply and demand amounts to grotesque mismanagement and a crime against the world’s poor, the planet’s other species, and future generations.	解决不了影响供需的问题就等同于荒诞可笑的管理不善甚至是对穷人、地球其他物种和子孙后代的犯罪。
	
Donald Trump’s Federal Reserve	特朗普的美联储
CAMBRIDGE – With the appointment of Jerome Powell as the next Chair of the United States Federal Reserve Board, Donald Trump has made perhaps the most important single decision of his presidency.	坎布里奇—特朗普任命杰罗姆·鲍威尔（Jerome Powell）为下一任美联储主席，这也许是他担任总统以来所做的最重要的决定。
It is a sane and sober choice that heralds short-term continuity in Fed interest-rate policy, and perhaps a simpler and cleaner approach to regulatory policy.	这是一个理智清醒的选择，表明美联储的货币政策在短期将保持延续性，也表明美联储监管政策或将更加简单清晰。
Although Powell is not a PhD economist like current Fed Chair Janet Yellen and her predecessor, Ben Bernanke, he has used his years as an “ordinary” governor at the Fed to gain a deep knowledge of the key issues he will face.	尽管鲍威尔不如现任美联储主席耶伦（Janet Yellen）和她的前任伯南克（Ben Bernanke）那样是一位拥有博士学位的经济学家，但凭借多年担任美联储“普通”理事的经验，他积累了关于他将面对的重要问题的深度知识。
But make no mistake: the institution Powell will now head rules the global financial system.	但不要搞错了：鲍威尔现在将要执掌的机构，主宰着全球金融体系。
All other central bankers, finance ministers, and even presidents run a distant second.	所有其他央行行长、财政部长甚至国家首脑，主宰力都远不如他。
If that seems hyperbolic, it is only because most of us don’t really pay attention to the Fed on a day-to-day basis.	如果说这看上去有些夸张，那只是因为我们大部分人其实并没有日常紧盯着美联储。
When the Fed gets it right, price stability reigns, unemployment remains low, and output hums along.	当美联储所做正确，物价就保持稳定，失业保持低位，产出源源不断。
But “getting it right” is not always easy, and when the Fed gets it wrong, the results can be pretty ugly.	但“所做正确”未必容易，而当美联储所做错误，结果也相当糟糕。
Famously, the Fed’s efforts to tame a stock-market bubble in the late 1920s sparked the Great Depression of the 1930s.	著名的例子有20世纪20年代末美联储熄灭股市泡沫的措施引发了30年代的大萧条。
(Fortunately, of the candidates Trump was considering for the Fed post, Powell is the one least likely to repeat this mistake.)	（幸运的是，在特朗普考虑过的美联储主席人选中，鲍威尔是最不可能重蹈这一覆辙的。
And when the Fed printed mountains of money in the 1970s to try to dull the pain of that decade’s oil shocks, it triggered an inflationary surge that took more than a decade to tame.	）20世纪70年代，美联储海量印钞，试图以此平息这个十年中石油冲击所带来的阵痛，结果引发了通胀飙升，又花了十多年才把通胀遏制住。
At times, the rest of the world seems to care more about Fed policy than Americans do.	在很多时候，世界其他国家比美国人更加关注美联储的政策。
Little wonder: perhaps more than ever, the US dollar lies at the heart of the global financial system.	这并不奇怪：美元在全球金融体系中的核心地位也许比以往任何时候都更加稳固。
This is partly because much of world trade and finance is indexed to the dollar, leading many countries to try to mimic Fed policies to stabilize their exchange rates.	这部分是因为世界贸易和金融大部分与美元挂钩，导致许多国家要跟在美联储的政策后亦步亦趋以稳定汇率。
Powell will face some extraordinary challenges at the outset of his five-year term.	在他的五年任期伊始，鲍威尔就将面临一些重大挑战。
By some measures, stock markets look even frothier today than they did in the 1920s.	从某些角度衡量，今天的股市比20世纪20年代泡沫更甚。
With today’s extraordinarily low interest rates, investors seem ever more willing to assume greater risk in search of return.	在当今极低的利率环境下，投资者似乎更加愿意为了回报而承受更大风险。
At the same time, despite a strongly growing US and global economy, inflation remains mystifyingly low.	与此同时，尽管美国和全球经济都在强劲增长中，通胀仍然令人困惑地低迷。
This has made it extremely difficult for the Fed to normalize policy interest rates (still only 1%) so that it has room to cut them when the next recession hits, which it inevitably will.	这使得美联储的政策利率（仍只有1 % ） 正常化变得极其困难。 而只有实现了政策利率正常化，美联储才有空间在下一次衰退来临时（这是无法避免的）削减利率。
(The odds of a recession hitting in any given year are around 17%, and that seems like a good guess now.)	（任何给定年份发生衰退的概率为17 % ， 而现在衰退概率很高。 ）
If Powell and the Fed cannot normalize interest rates before the next recession, what will they do?	如果鲍威尔和美联储无法在下一次衰退前实现利率正常化，他们该怎么办？
Yellen insists that there is nothing to worry about; the Fed has everything under control, because it can turn to alternative instruments.	耶伦坚持认为没什么好担心的；美联储一切尽在掌握，因为它还有另类工具可用。
But many economists have come to believe that much of this is smoke and mirrors.	但许多经济学家相信这些基本上都是骗人的东西。
For example, so-called quantitative easing involves having the Fed issue short-term debt to buy up long-term government debt.	比如，所谓的量化宽松就是让美联储发行短期债务去买长期政府债务。
But the US Treasury owns the Fed, and can carry out such debt purchases perfectly well by itself.	但美国财政部拥有美联储，它大可以自己完成这类债务购买。
Some argue for “helicopter money,” whereby the Fed prints money and hands it out.	一些人认为可以“直升机撒钱 ” ， 即美联储印钱然后发钱。
But this, too, is smoke and mirrors.	这也是骗人的把戏。
The Fed has neither the legal authority nor the political mandate to run fiscal policy; if it tries to do so, it runs the risk of forever losing its independence.	美联储既没有法定权力，也没有政治授权来负责财政政策；如果它要这样做的话，就有可能永远失去独立性。
Given that monetary policy is the first and best line of defense against a recession, an urgent task for the new chair is to develop a better approach.	货币政策是衰退的第一道也是最有效的一道防线，因此，新主席的一个紧迫任务是制定更好的方针。
Fortunately, good ideas exist, and one can only hope that Powell will quickly move to create a committee to study long-term fixes.	幸运的是，好主意是有的，我们只能寄希望于鲍威尔能够迅速成立一个委员会研究长期方案。
One idea is to raise the Fed’s inflation target.	一个主意是提高美联储的通胀目标。
But this would be problematic, not least because it would breach a decades-long promise to keep inflation around 2%.	但这会带来问题，因为会打破几十年来将通胀保持在2%左右的承诺。
Moreover, higher inflation would induce greater indexation, ultimately undermining the effectiveness of monetary policy.	此外，更高的通胀将引来更大的指数化，最终影响货币政策的效果。
Paving the way for effective negative-interest-rate policy is a more radical – but by far the more elegant – solution.	为有效的负利率政策铺路是更加激进，但也是到目前为止最文雅的方案。
Bank regulation is also part of the Fed’s mandate.	银行监管也属于美联储的权限范围。
The 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation, which has spawned 30,000 pages of rules, has been a boon for lawyers.	规则厚达30,000页的2010年多德-弗兰克（Dodd-Frank）金融改革立法让律师乐开了花。
But the massive compliance costs ultimately fall on small and medium-size businesses.	但巨大的合规成本最终要落到中小企业头上。
It would be far better simply to require banks to raise much more of their resources in equity markets instead of through bonds.	简单地要求银行加大从股市而非债券募集资源是一个更好的办法。
That way, shareholders, not taxpayers, would take the big hit in a crisis.	如此，当危机来临时，受影响的将是股东而非纳税人。
I have not mentioned the elephant in the room: the threat to the Fed’s independence posed by a president seemingly intent on challenging all institutional norms.	我还没有提到房间中的大象：一位貌似要挑战一切制度规范的总统给美联储的独立性带来的威胁。
When President Richard Nixon was intent on being re-elected in 1972, he put heavy pressure on then-Fed Chair Arthur Burns to “juice” the economy.	1972年，尼克松总统寻求连任时，他向时任美联储主席伯恩斯（Arthur Berns）大举施压，要他“水灌”经济。
Nixon was re-elected, but inflation soared and growth collapsed.	尼克松成功连任了，但通胀飙升，增长崩溃。
No one should be wishing for a replay – even if Nixon eventually was impeached.	没人想要重新体验这一过程 — — 即使尼克松最终还是被弹劾了。
	
Jihad or Murder?	圣战还是谋杀？
It is remarkable that some of the most critical concepts of Muslim religious terminology have now become part of the international language of current affairs.	穆斯林宗教词汇中一些最关键的概念成为国际时事的常用词是一个令人瞩目的现象。
Questions drawn from Islamic theology are discussed freely by the world public, engaging specialists and non-specialists, Muslims and non-Muslims.	从伊斯兰神学中抽出的问题在世界公众中被广泛讨论，吸引了专家和大众，穆斯林和非穆斯林。
Theological disputation has moved far from Islam’s religious academies.	神学的争论早已不局限在伊斯兰宗教学府之中。
For example, the term jihad, commonly translated as “holy war,” has become nearly ubiquitous.	例如 ， “ jihad”一词，通常被译作“圣战 ” ， 现在已经可说是无处不在了。
Though conceived in early Muslim history as a means of spreading God’s word, Muslim scholars today distinguish between two kinds of jihad – one being an internal struggle against temptation, and the other a physical conflict against an aggressor who threatens the survival or the fundamental rights of a Muslim community.	虽然在它最早出现在穆斯林历史上时，意指一种传播神谕的方式。 当今的穆斯林学者们将两种“jihad”区分开来—一种是抗拒诱惑的内心斗争，而另一种则是针对威胁穆斯林社会的生存或根本权利的入侵者的斗争。
In this context, there is widespread rejection of the fundamentalists’ use of the term.	在这种情况下，原教旨主义者对该词的使用普遍不被认同。
Numerous Muslim scholars have raised their voices to challenge the terrorists’ defense of suicide bombings or attacks on civilians, offering long citations from centuries of religious jurisprudence.	无数的穆斯林学者都从几个世纪以来的宗教法律中引经据典，高声质问恐怖分子对其自杀式炸弹和对平民的攻击的辩护。
In itself, this approach represents a worthy expression of collective conscience in opposition to the terrorists.	这种质问本身就是反对恐怖分子的集体良知的可贵表现。
But many among the public and in the media want more.	但公众和媒体要求的还要更多。
Muslim intellectuals are being encouraged to press the religious argument against fundamentalist violence in order to deprive the terrorists of their most fearsome and potent arguments.	穆斯林知识分子们被鼓励以宗教理论来驳斥原教旨主义的暴力，从而使恐怖分子失去最可怕和有力的理论支持。
If Muslim scholars can somehow disprove these arguments, it is thought, then the terrorists’ ability to sustain their violent underground will be reduced.	人们认为如果穆斯林的学者能够推翻他们的论点，那么恐怖分子们维持其暴力地下活动的能力就会减弱。
Is this right?	果真如此吗？
A quick survey of the history of religious conflict shows that theological controversies have never been resolved by theological arguments.	对宗教冲突的历史进行一个快速的调查就会发现神学争论从来就不是神学争端的解决之道。
Looking more closely, one finds that while these controversies were often framed in religious terms, they were not at all about religion.	进一步仔细考察，我们会发现这些以宗教语汇表达的争议其实与宗教根本没有关系。
The range of opposing interpretations of religious texts is virtually unlimited, and disputes are seldom resolved by rational argument.	对宗教经典相互矛盾的诠释可以是无休止的，而这些争端极少能通过理性辩论来解决。
In earlier times, such controversies were decided by political authorities, which used military force to impose one particular point of view at the expense of all others.	在早期，这样的争议要由政治权威来评判。 当权者使用武力，以压制其他观点为代价来树立某种观点。
Muslim history is full of such cases.	穆斯林的历史中，这样的例子不胜枚举。
Recently, when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, he found scholars who raised theological arguments on his behalf.	当萨达姆·侯赛因最近一次入侵科威特时，他御用了一些提出神学观点为他代言的学者。
The coalition confronting him had no difficulty finding religious arguments that led to precisely the opposite conclusion.	与他对抗的联军也毫不费力地找到了相应的神学论点，从而得出正好相反的结论。
Today, it is clear that fundamentalists and their supporters are completely closed off to even the most elaborate theological refutation of their views, even when produced by distinguished religious authorities.	当今，非常清楚的一点就是原教旨主义者及其支持者们对驳斥他们观点的，哪怕是最详尽的神学论述也完全充耳不闻。 即便是这些驳斥来自于德高望重的宗教权威，情况也是如此。
The first reflex of the fundamentalists is to withdraw from the mainstream, to build around themselves a shell that is impervious to any logic other than their own.	原教旨主义者们的第一反应就是从主流退却，并将自己包裹在一层外壳当中，使任何与己相左的逻辑都无法穿透。
The most essential questions that humans face today – those that engender the deepest conflicts – have nothing to do with theology.	人类当今面临的最本质的一些问题—那些引发最深层次冲突的问题—都与神学无关。
They concern disputes over territory, political power, definitions of rights, and distribution of wealth.	与之相关的是领土争端、政治权力、权力定义和财富分配。
The means of discussing these questions is known to all and is expressed in all religions and all languages.	探讨这些问题的方式人尽皆知，在所有的宗教和语言中也有所表达。
The evils most deeply resented – in all societies – are injustice, despotism, corruption, and poverty.	最令人痛恨的邪恶—在任何社会之中—都是不公正、专制、腐败和贫困。
We all understand what these mean, and how certain people must live with them on a daily basis.	我们都明白这些意味着什么，也知道人们如何在日常生活中免不了要为其所困。
Why, then, do we follow the fundamentalists to the very heart of their madness?	那么，为什么我们还要跟随原教旨主义者到他们疯狂的根源呢？
Allowing them to frame these problems in religious terms legitimizes the perspective that they are attempting to impose, particularly in their own societies.It also allows them to camouflage their very worldly thirst for power.	允许他们将这些问题宗教化，就使那些他们一直企图强加于人的观点合法化了。 这在他们各自的社会中更是如此。
Repeatedly, the Muslim religious establishment has been urged to issue statements denying fundamentalists the right to use religious terms like jihad.	国际社会反复敦促穆斯林宗教组织发布声明，剥夺原教旨主义者使用“圣战”一类宗教词汇的权利。
But experience has proven that this approach leads nowhere.	但经验告诉我们这样的做法不会有结果。
In fact, debates about the use of religious terms lend credibility to fundamentalist efforts to apply these ideas to conditions in the modern world.	事实上，关于使用宗教词汇的辩论反倒为原教旨主义者们在现代世界的条件下使用这些理念提供了可信度。
Such debates concede that these religious concepts are generally valid, even when, as in the fundamentalists’ case, they simply do not apply.	这样的辩论承认即便是在不适用于原教旨主义者的情况下，这些宗教理念通常还是有效的。
As a result, the entire discussion could easily backfire.	最终，整场讨论的结果很可能会适得其反。
Invariably, fundamentalists dismiss religious critiques of their views as evidence that religious authorities have been corrupted by hostile influences.	原教旨主义者总是将对他们观点的批评作为宗教权威被敌对势力腐化的证据而置之不理。
In this way, the terrorists oppose the “purity” and “authenticity” of their arguments to the compromises presumably forced upon religious establishments.	如此一来，恐怖分子们就能将自己观点的“纯粹”和“真实”作为反驳被认为是强加于宗教组织的妥协的论点。
Speaking to Muslims exclusively in their own religious terms also excludes them from broad ethical frameworks that defend essential human values, most notably the protection of innocent civilians.	仅用穆斯林自己的宗教语汇和他们沟通还会将他们从更广泛的道德伦理框架中排除出去。 这些框架捍卫着基本的人类价值观，其中最明显的就是保护无辜平民。
These values are the foundation upon which all religious and cultural traditions rest.	这些价值观是所有宗教和文化传统的立身之本。
To be sure, it is important to understand the discourse of those who are making war on societies – their own societies first and foremost.	为了确认一点，了解那些向社会宣战的人的观点就尤为重要。 他们身处的社会总是首当其冲。
But adopting the terrorists’ interpretation of events conceals the reality of this conflict.	但接受恐怖分子对这些事件的诠释就会掩饰这场冲突的真相。
Instead of fighting on behalf of political and religious liberty, we risk engaging in a conflict with the false images that the terrorists have created.	我们会冒在恐怖分子制造的假象影响下，卷入这场冲突的风险，而不会为政治和宗教自由而战。
Worse still, we would bring this conflict into our own societies, where different religious and cultural traditions are now inextricably mingled.	更糟糕的是，我们会将这场冲突带���我们自己的社会当中，而在我们的社会里，不同宗教以及文化传统已经不可分离地混合了。
There is simply no need to look to theology to call a crime by its proper name.	我们完全没有必要为了给某种罪行定名而求助于神学。
The revulsion provoked by the murder of innocents is deeply felt by all, and it is reprehensible by any standard, religious or not.	所有人对谋杀无辜者的行为都深恶痛绝。 这样的行为不论是以宗教还是非宗教的标准来看，都应受到谴责。
It may even be that religious language does not adequately express the repulsion we all feel toward the terrorists’ actions.	宗教词汇甚至还不足以表达我们对恐怖主义行径的厌恶。
No feeling of victimhood can justify, under any conditions, such crimes against innocents, and no theology can accept the negation of the human essence that we all share.	在任何情况下，任何受害者的情感也不能成为对无辜者施暴的借口。 任何的神学都不能接受对我们共有的人性本质的否定。
	
Big Data for Poor Students	穷学生的大数据
WASHINGTON, DC – Countries need skilled and talented people to generate the innovations that underpin long-term economic growth.	华盛顿—国家需要高技能人才产生推动长期经济增长的创新。
This is as true in developed as it is in developing economies.	发达国家和发展中国家莫不如此。
But it will not happen without investment in education and training.	但这只有通过教育和培训投资才能实现。
If we are to end poverty, reduce unemployment, and stem rising economic inequality, we must find new, better, and cheaper ways to teach – and on a vast scale.	如果我们想终结贫困、减少失业、阻止经济不平等性升高，我们就需要找到更新、更好、更便宜并且是大规模庞的教学方式。
This goal may seem to be beyond even wealthier countries’ means; but the intelligent collection, analysis, and use of educational data could make a big difference.	这一目标或许连富国都难以实现；但聪明地收集、分析和利用教育数据可以带来大不同。
And, fortunately, we live in an age in which information technology gives us the right tools to broaden access to high-quality, affordable education.	此外，幸运的是，在我们生活的时代，信息科技给了我们合适的工具拓展了获得高质量、可负担教育的途径。
Big data – high-volume, complex data sets that businesses use to analyze and predict consumer behavior – can provide teachers and companies with unprecedented amounts of information about student learning patterns, helping schools to personalize instruction in increasingly sophisticated ways.	大数据 — — 企业用来分析和预测消费者行为的大量复杂数据集 — — 可以为教师和公司提供前所未有的关于学生学习方式的信息，帮助学校以日渐成熟的方式实现个性化教学。
The World Bank Group and its private-sector lending arm, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), are trying to harness this potential to support national education systems.	世界银行集团及其私人贷款部门国际金融公司（IFC）正在试图将这一潜能用于支持国民教育体系。
A recently launched initiative, called the Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER), collects and shares comparative data on educational policies and institutions from countries around the world.	最新推出的改善教育的系统方法（Systems Approach for Better Education Results ，SABER）计划收集和共享各国教育政策和机构的可比数据。
In the private sector, the ability to collect information about teacher-student interaction, and interaction between students and learning systems, can have a profound impact.	在私人部门，收集师生互动和学生-学习系统互动信息的能力能带来深远影响。
In Kenya, for example, Bridge International Academies is using adaptive learning on a large scale.	比如，在肯尼亚，布里奇国际研究院（Bridge International Academies，BIA）正在大规模使用适应性学习。
An IFC client founded by three American entrepreneurs, Bridge runs 259 nursery and primary schools, with monthly tuition averaging $6.	BIA是一家由三家美国企业建立的IFC客户机构，运营着259家幼儿园和小学，平均月度学费为6美元。
It is a massive learning laboratory for students and educators alike.	这是面向学生和教育者的大规模学习实验。
Bridge tests different approaches to teaching standard skills and concepts by deploying two versions of a lesson at the same time in a large number of classrooms.	BIA测试教授标准技能和概念的不同方法。 它在大量班级同时部署两个版本的课程。
The lessons are delivered by teachers from standardized, scripted plans, via tablets that also track how long the teachers spend on each lesson.	课程由教师根据标准��书面教案讲授，并通过平板电脑追踪教师每个版本的授课时间。
Exam results are recorded on the teacher’s tablet, with more than 250,000 scores logged every 21 days.	考试结果保存在教师的平板电脑中，每21天会录入250,000多项分数。
From these data, Bridge’s evaluation team determines which lesson is most effective and distributes that lesson throughout the rest of the Academy’s network.	从这些数据中，BIA评估团队分析出哪个版本的课程最有效，并在BIA网络中的其他学校推广这个版本的课程。
We know that a host of issues can cause a student’s performance to decline – scorching summer heat in classrooms without air conditioning, problems at home, or poor-quality teachers, to name a few.	我们知道，一系列问题可能造成学生表现下降 — — 夏季无空调教室的高温、家庭问题、教师质量欠佳，等等。
But when one gathers results on a large scale, variables flatten out, and the important differences emerge.	但当你大规模收集结果时，变量就会扁平化，重要的区别会浮现出来。
That is the great value of big data.	这就是大数据的重大意义。
Another case is SABIS, a provider of K-12 education in the United States, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa.	另一个例子是SABIS。 SABIS在美国、欧洲、亚洲、中东和北非提供K-12教育。
SABIS mines large data sets to ensure high standards and enhance academic performance for more than 63,000 students.	SABIS挖掘大数据以确保高标准，增进63,000多名学生的学习成绩。
Continuous tracking of annual student academic performance yields more than 14 million data points that are used to shape instruction, achieve learning objectives, and ensure consistency across the company’s network of schools in 15 countries.	对学生年度学习成绩的持续追踪产生了1,400多万个数据点，这些数据点被用来确定教学方案、实现学习目标以及确保公司分布在15个国家的学校网络的一致性。
Knewton, an adaptive learning platform that personalizes digital courses using predictive analytics, is another company at the forefront of the data revolution.	Knewton公司是另一家居于数据革命前列的公司。 该公司是一家适应性学习平台，用预测分析实现数字资源的个性化。
With tailored content and instruction, even classrooms without private-school resources can provide individual learning.	有了量身定做的内容和说明，即便不具备私立学校资源的学校也可以提供个体学习。
As a result, teachers spend their time in the most effective way possible – solving problems with students – instead of delivering undifferentiated lessons.	结果，教师可以将时间用在效果最好的方式上 — — 与学生一起解题 — — 而不是无差别地授课。
These benefits do not come without risk.	这些好处并不是没有风险的。
We are only beginning to grapple with how big data’s tremendous potential for learning can be harnessed while protecting students’ privacy.	我们才刚刚开始领会大数据可以在保护学生隐私的基础上提供多么大的学习潜力。
In some cases, data-collection technology is outpacing our ability to decide how it should be collected, stored, and shared.	在一些情形中，数据收集技术已经超越了我们确定数据应该如何收集、储存和共享的能力。
No matter how rigorously data are secured, there is still a need for a clear licensing structure for its use.	无论数据保护的力度多大，我们都需要明确的许可制度规范数据的使用。
In many developing countries, there are no regulations for data privacy at all.	在许多发展中国家，根本没有关于数据隐私方面的监管措施。
The interface between data and education holds the promise of new educational products for improved learning, with large potential benefits, especially for the poor.	数据和教育之间的接口是新教育产品的关键，这些新教育产品可以改善学习效果，带来巨大的好处，特别是对穷国来说。
To realize those benefits – and to do so responsibly – we must ensure that data collection is neither excessive nor inappropriate, and that it supports learning.	要实现这些好处 — — 并且以负责任的方式实现 — — 我们必须确保数据收集恰到好处并且支持学习。
The private sector, governments, and institutions such as the World Bank Group need to formulate rules for how critical information on student performance is gathered, shared, and used.	私人部门、政府和世界银行集团等机构需要制定关于如何收集、共享和使用学生表现方面的关键数据的规则。
Parents and students deserve no less.	这是家长和学生应得的。
	
From War to Work	从战争到就业
OXFORD – There is no denying that conflict has far-reaching negative effects, including on employment.	牛津 — — 不可否认冲突对包括就业形势在内的方方面面都能产生深远的负面影响。
But the prevailing understanding of the relationship between conflict and employment does not fully recognize the complexity of this relationship – a shortcoming that undermines effective employment policies in fragile states.	但对冲突和就业关系的普遍理解却并未充分体现其中的复杂性 — — 这样的缺陷阻碍了脆弱国家制定有效的就业政策。
The conventional wisdom is that conflict destroys jobs.	传统观点是冲突对就业起损害作用。
Moreover, because unemployment can spur more conflict, as unemployed young people find validation and economic rewards in violent movements, job creation should be a central part of post-conflict policy.	不仅如此，失业年轻人在暴力活动中寻找自我价值和经济回报可能使失业引发进一步冲突，因此创造就业机会应当是后冲突期的核心政策。
But, while this certainly sounds logical, these assumptions, as I detailed in a 2015 paper, are not necessarily entirely accurate.	尽管这听上去完全合乎逻辑，但我在2015年一篇论文中提到这些假设并不一定是完全准确的。
The first assumption – that violent conflicts destroy jobs – ignores the fact that every conflict is unique.	第一种假设 — — 即暴力冲突破坏就业 — — 忽略了每一次冲突都各有特色。
Some, like the 2008-2009 Sri Lankan civil war, are concentrated in a relatively small area, leaving much of the country – and thus the economy – unaffected.	有些，比如2008到2009年的斯里兰卡内战集中在相对较小的区域，从而导致该国大部分地区（以及经济）并未受到影响。
Even endemic conflicts, like the recurrent conflicts in the Congo, might not have a major impact on net employment.	就连刚果那样不间断的地方性冲突也有可能不对就业状况造成重要影响。
After all, the jobs that are lost in, say, the public sector or among commodity exporters may be largely offset by new jobs in government and rebel armed forces, informal production substituting for imports, and illegal activities like drug production and smuggling.	毕竟，在公共部门或产品出口商那里丧失的工作机会可以很大程度上在政府及反叛力量的新增就业机会那里得到补偿。 非正规生产代替进口，此外，新增就业机会还部分来源于毒品生产和走私等非法活动。
Likewise, the second assumption – that unemployment is a major cause of violent conflict – misses crucial nuances.	同样，第二种假设 — — 即失业是暴力冲突的主要原因 — — 并没有考虑到关键的微妙之处。
For starters, the formal sector accounts for just a fraction of total employment in most conflict-affected countries.	首先，正规行业在绝大多数受冲突影响的国家仅占就业总体份额的一小部分。
The majority of working people are in the informal sector, often engaged in low-status, low-productivity, and low-incomes activities that can, just like unemployment, generate dissatisfaction and potentially motivate young people to join violent movements.	绝大多数就业人口都集中在非正规行业，往往从事低社会地位、低生产率和低收入的工作。 这样的工作就像失业一样，可以带来不满并有可能促使年轻人参加暴力活动。
Given this, simply expanding formal-sector employment is not enough, unless it also improves the situation of young people in low-income informal-sector jobs.	有鉴于此，除非同时改善在低收入非正规行业就业的年轻人处境，否则仅仅扩大正规行业就业还远远不够。
Yet post-conflict employment policies almost invariably neglect the informal sector.	但后冲突时期，就业政策几乎无一例外地忽视非正规行业的作用。
Worse, new regulations – such as the ban on commercial biking in Freetown, Sierra Leone – sometimes block productive informal activities undertaken by youth.	更糟的是，新出台法规 — — 如塞拉利昂禁止在弗里敦开展商业自行车业务 — — 有时还会对年轻人在非正规行业的有效就业起阻碍作用。
But even a focus on the informal sector is insufficient, as research has shown that poverty and marginalization are not, on their own, enough to cause conflict.	但即使关注非正规行业也还远远不够，因为研究表明贫困和边缘化本身并不足以引发冲突。
If they were, most poor countries would be in conflict most of the time.	如果贫困和边缘化是冲突的充分条件，那么多数贫困国家绝大部分时间都将在冲突中度过。
And that is not even remotely the case.	但实际情况却远不是这样的。
Violent conflict occurs when leaders are motivated to mobilize their followers for it.	只有领袖鼓励追随者诉诸武力才会引发暴力冲突。
That motivation can stem from a variety of sources, among the most common being exclusion from power.	上层动机可能来源于方方面面，其中最常见的莫过于统治权被剥夺。
In that case, leaders will appeal to a common identity – for example, religion in the case of contemporary conflicts in the Middle East, or ethnicity in many African conflicts – to mobilize followers.	在那种情况下，领导层会利用某种共同身份来动员追随者 — — 如中东地区现代冲突中这种共同身份是宗教、而非洲许多冲突的共同身份则是种族。
Of course, more than a shared identity alone is needed for mobilization to occur.	当然，需要比共同身份更多的因素才能成功地动员冲突。
People will generally respond only if they already have grievances – in particular, if they feel that their group faces discrimination in access to resources and jobs.	人们一般在已经心存怨愤的情况下才会去响应武力号召 — — 尤其当他们感觉所属团体在资源和就业方面面临被歧视的状况。
In this sense, employment is relevant, but what matters is not the absolute level of employment so much as the distribution of good jobs among religious or ethnic groups.	从这个意义上讲，就业与冲突具有相关性，但重要的却不是绝对的就业水平，而是好工作在不同宗教或种族团体之间的分配状况。
In other words, simply creating more jobs, without regard to their allocation, may not ease tensions; if imbalances persist, job creation may even make things worse.	换句话说，仅仅创造更多就业机会而不考虑机会的分配或许对缓解紧张局势没有帮助；如果不平衡局面持续存在，就业机会的创造本身甚至可能使情况更糟。
Yet post-conflict employment policies almost always neglect so-called “horizontal inequalities.”	但后冲突阶段的就业政策几乎总是忽视所谓的“横向不平等 ” 。
For example, employment policies did little to reduce the strong regional imbalances and discrimination within regions that persisted in Bosnia and Herzegovina after the war there in the 1990s.	举例来说，20世纪90年代波斯尼亚和黑塞哥维那的战后就业政策在减少地区严重不平衡和歧视方面并未发挥多大作用。
Given these failings, it is not surprising that employment policies’ net effects are often very small relative to the size of the problem.	鉴于存在上述缺陷，就业政策的净影响相对问题而言往往规模较小也就不足为怪了。
In both Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina, job creation was thought to be central to post-conflict peacekeeping efforts.	在科索沃、波斯尼亚和黑塞哥维那，后冲突维和工作的核心都是创造就业机会。
Yet, in Kosovo, unemployment stood at 45% six years after its war ended.	但在科索沃，战争结束6年后失业率仍高达45 % 。
In Bosnia, new programs generated just 8,300 jobs, while 450,000 people were demobilized; 20 years after the end of the conflict, the unemployment rate stood at 44%.	而在波斯尼亚，新计划仅仅创造了8，300个就业机会，而复原人数则高达450，000之多；冲突结束20年后，失业率仍在44%的位置居高不下。
There is one example of a successful post-crisis employment policy.	后危机就业政策有一个成功的例子。
Nepal’s government sought to expand opportunities in the informal sector after the country’s civil war, implementing programs focused on building infrastructure, issuing micro-credit, and providing technology assistance, targeting the most deprived regions and castes.	即尼泊尔政府在内战结束后曾寻求拓展非正式行业机会，并全力落实针对最贫困地区和阶层的以建设基础设施、发放小额贷款和提供技术援助为重点的政策。
Recognizing the role that caste and ethnic tensions and discrimination played in fueling the conflict, the government designed employment schemes specifically for rural areas, along the same lines as India’s employment scheme, with 100 days of work per household guaranteed.	出于对阶层、种族紧张和歧视在助长冲突方面所起作用的认识，尼泊尔政府专门为农村地区设计了就业计划，该计划借鉴了印度计划的成功经验，保证为每户提供100天的工作量。
The programs were supported by the Nepalese government and external donors, and focused on poorer regions and villages (and, within them, on the poorest castes).	上述计划得到尼泊尔政府和国外捐助者的支持，重点保障贫困地区和村庄（以及其中最贫困阶层）的实施工作。
The period immediately following a conflict is a delicate one.	冲突刚刚结束的这段时期非常微妙。
Leaders must make the most of that time, ensuring that every policy they pursue is as effective as possible.	领导人必须充分利用这段时间，确保实施的每项政策都尽可能有效。
When it comes to employment, that means designing programs that reflect how people actually spend their working lives, as well as addressing the real grievances generating tensions.	具体到就业问题，这意味着设计出反映人们实际工作生活的就业计划，并解决造成紧张关系的现实不满因素。
Otherwise, they risk allowing, if not encouraging, a relapse into organized violence.	否则，他们即使没有鼓励、也是在默许国家重新陷入到有组织的暴力当中。
	
Jobless Recoveries and Manic Policies	失业性复苏和政策狂躁症
	发自芝加哥 — — 在2001年以及最近的这次衰退中，美国都实施了堪称工业时代以来最为宽松的货币和财政政策。
CHICAGO – Monetary and fiscal policies in the United States, both in this recession and the recession of 2001, have been among the most accommodating in the industrial world. As I write, Congress is working on yet another “jobs” bill. Indeed, John Taylor of Stanford University attributes the recent financial crisis to excessively stimulatory monetary policy towards the end of Alan Greenspan’s tenure as head of the US Federal Reserve.	就在本文落笔之时，国会还在制定另外一份“就业”法案。 事实上，斯坦福大学经济学教授约翰·泰勒教授将最近这场经济危机归因于艾伦·格林斯潘作为美联储主席任期即将届满而推行的过度刺激性货币政策。
Why is US policy so accommodating?	那美国的政策为何会如此宽松呢？
A central reason is that the nature of US economic recoveries has changed.	这主要是因为美国经济的本质已经发生了转变。
From 1960 until 1991, US recoveries were typically rapid. From the trough of recessions, recovery to pre-recession output levels took less than two quarters on average, and employment recovered within eight months.	在1960年到1991年间美国的经济复苏速度都相当快，那时从衰退的最低点恢复到衰退前产出水平平均只要不到2个季度，而就业在八个月以内就恢复到原来水平了。
But the recoveries from the recessions of 1991 and 2001 were different.	但1991年和2001年的复苏则截然不同。
For example, in 2001, it took just one quarter for output to recover, but 38 months for jobs to come back. The current recovery appears to be similarly slow in creating jobs.	在2001年，产出水平只花了1个季度就恢复原状，但就业率却整整拖了38个月才回到原点，而当前的复苏在恢复就业方面似乎也同样缓慢无比。
Some economists argue that, unlike past recoveries, when workers who were temporarily laid off were rehired, job losses starting in 1991 were more permanent.	有些经济学家认为，在以往的复苏中工人只是临时退出工作岗位，而现今职位的流失则是长期性的。
Unemployed workers had to find jobs in new industries, which took more time and training.	失业的工人必须在新的行业找工作，而这也要耗费更多时间和培训。
Others suggest that the Internet has made it easier for firms to hire quickly.	另一些经济学家则认为互联网使得企业的招聘变得更容易了。
So, rather than hire in panic at the first sign of a recovery for fear that they will be unable to do so later and lose sales, firms would rather make sure that the recovery is well established before adding workers.	因此与其在复苏初露端倪之时因为害怕以后招不到人影响销售而一窝蜂地去抢人，倒不如在确认真正复苏之后再增加人手。
Regardless of the true explanation, the US is singularly unprepared for jobless recoveries.	但不管真正的解释究竟是什么，奇怪的是，美国似乎没有还准备好如何应对这种失业性复苏。
Typically, unemployment benefits last only six months.	政府一般只发放6个月的失业补助。
Moreover, because health-care benefits are often tied to jobs, an unemployed worker also risks losing access to affordable health care.	此外，由于健康医疗补助往往都是跟就业联系在一起的，因此一个失业工人同时也面对着承担不起医疗保障费用的风险。
Short-duration benefits may have been appropriate when recoveries were fast and jobs plentiful, because the fear of losing benefits before finding a job may have given workers an incentive to look harder.	在复苏迅速而且职位充足的情况下，短期的补贴是很管用的，因为那种在找到工作前失去补助金的恐惧将促使工人努力去找工作。
But, with few jobs being created, a positive incentive has turned into a source of great anxiety.	但在只有少量职位产生的情况下，这种正面激励将摇身一变成为极大的焦虑。
Even those who have jobs fear that they could lose them and be cast adrift.	即便是那些在职的人也会担心因为失去工作而生活无着。
Politicians ignore popular anxiety at their peril.	政客们往往会忽略了公众这种担忧对他们的危害。
President George H.W. Bush is widely believed to have lost his re-election bid, despite winning a popular war in Iraq, because he seemed out of touch with public hardship following the 1991 recession.	许多人认为美国前总统老布什之所以在赢得了一场人气极高的伊拉克战争之后还输掉了连任，就是因为他似乎对1991年衰退中民众的苦况麻木不仁。
That lesson has been fully internalized.	这个教训也被很多人记住了。
Economic recovery is all about jobs, not output, and politicians are willing to push for economic stimulus, both fiscal (tax cuts or government spending) and monetary (lower short-term interest rates), until jobs start reappearing.	经济复苏说的是就业，而不是产出，因此政客们都愿意推行经济刺激政策，不管是财政上的（比如减税或者是政府支出）还是货币上的（调低短期利率 ） ， 直到职位又重新出现了为止。
In theory, this is what democracy is all about – policy responding to the needs of the people.	理论上，这就是民主的真谛 — — 政策是以民众的需要为指向的。
In practice, though, public pressure to do something quickly enables politicians to run roughshod over the usual checks and balances on government policy making.	不过在实践上来说，公众那种要求立刻见效的压力令到政客可以罔顾政府政策制定中的利益制衡原则来推行政策。
Long-term spending and tax policies are enacted under the shadow of an emergency, with the party that happens to be in power at the time of the downturn getting to push its pet agenda.	长期的政府支出和税收政策常常以救火的名义出台，那些恰好在衰退时期执政的政党则借机夹带私货。
Much of what is enacted as stimulus has little immediate effect on job creation, but does have an adverse long-term effect on government finances.	许多以刺激名义推出的政策其实并不能立刻产生职位，却对政府财政有着长期的负面作用。
For example, the 2009 stimulus package enacted by the Obama administration had many billions of dollars devoted to cancer research, though such research employs few people directly and is spent over a long time horizon – far beyond that of even a prolonged recovery.	比如奥巴马政府在2009年推出的一揽子刺激计划将数百亿美元投向了癌症研究计划，即便这些研究根本雇用不了多少人，且财政支付的时间跨度很长 — — 甚至比一个长期复苏所持续的时间还要长。
Equally deleterious to economic health is the recent vogue of cutting interest rates to near zero and holding them there for a sustained period.	此外同样对经济有害的还有最近流行的所谓将利率降到接近零并维持一段时期的呼声。
It is far from clear that near-zero short-term interest rates (as compared to just low interest rates) have much additional effect in encouraging firms to create jobs when powerful economic forces make them reluctant to hire.	而接近零的短期利率（相对于仅仅是低利率）究竟在强大的经济力量迫使企业踌躇于招工之时能起到多少激励作用还是一笔糊涂帐。
But prolonged near-zero rates can foster the wrong kinds of activities.	但长期施行近于零的利率将催生错误的行为。
For example, households and investment managers, reluctant to keep money in safe money-market funds, instead seek to invest in securities with longer maturities and higher credit risk, so long as they offer extra yield.	比如家庭主妇和投资经理都会不愿意将钱放在安全的货币市场基金上，转而投资于到期日更长且信用风险更高的证券上，只要这些东西能提供更高的回报就行。
Likewise, money fleeing low US interest rates (and, more generally, industrial countries) has pushed up emerging-market equity and real-estate prices, setting them up for a fall (as we witnessed recently with the flight to safety following Europe’s financial turmoil).	同样，因低美元利率（以及总体上各工业国家）出逃的货币将推高新兴市场的股市和楼市，最终引发暴跌（正如我们最近看见的欧洲金融动荡中的资金避险行为那样 ） 。
Moreover, even if corporations in the US are not hiring, corporations elsewhere are.	此外，即便美国本土的公司没有动静，其他地区的企业却在招人。
Brazil’s unemployment rate, for example, is at lows not seen for decades.	巴西的失业率目前正维持在数十年以来的最低水平。
If the Fed were to accept the responsibilities of its de facto role as the world’s central banker, it would have to admit that its policy rates are not conducive to stable world growth.	如果美联储想要承担自己事实上作为世界央行所负有的责任的话，那它也就必须承认自己的政策利率是无助于世界稳定增长的。
Policy would still be accommodative if the Fed maintained low interest rates rather than the zero level that was appropriate for a panic.	而如果美联储放弃更适用于恐慌时期的近零利率而选择维持一个低利率的话，政策依然是属于宽松的。
And this would give savers less of an incentive to search for yield, thus avoiding financial instability.	但这将减少储户将钱取出来追求回报的冲动，从而避免金融不稳定。
Politicians will not sit quietly, however, if the Fed attempts to raise rates.	美联储想提高利率的话，政客们可不会坐以待毙的。
Their thinking – and the Fed’s – follows the misguided calculus that if low rates are good for jobs, ultra-low rates must be even better.	他们的思维 — — 以及美联储的 — — 遵循一条错误的计算方式，那就是如果低利率有利于刺激就业的话，更低的利率就能刺激更多就业。
Emerging studies on the risk-taking and asset-price inflation engendered by ultra-low policy rates will eventually convince Fed policymakers to change their stance.	在由极低政策利率所引发的高风险行为和资产价格通胀方面不断涌现的研究将最终说服美联储的政策制定者去改变他们的立场。
But, if politicians are to become less anxious about jobs, perhaps we need to start discussing whether jobless recoveries are here to stay, and whether the US safety net, devised for a different era, needs to be modified.	但如果政客们能对就业问题不那么急功近利的话，或者就是我们开始讨论失业性复苏会否持续，而只为过去某个特定时期所设计的美国社会安全网是否需要改革的时候了。
	
Profiles in Peacemaking	维和人物介绍
NEW YORK – Fifty years ago, President John F. Kennedy did the seemingly impossible.	纽约 — — 五十年前，美国总统约翰·F·肯尼迪完成了看似不可能完成的任务。
At the height of the Cold War, he moved the two nuclear superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, toward peace.	他让美苏两个超级核大国在冷战高潮期实现了向和平的过渡。
The lessons of Kennedy’s act of leadership – one of the greatest of modern times – are directly relevant today.	肯尼迪的领导艺术在现代史上极其伟大，他留给我们的经验教训在当前仍有着直接的意义。
I recount this remarkable story in a new book, To Move the World.	我在新著《推动世界》中对这个不平凡的故事进行了描述。
To many, war between the two superpowers seemed inevitable.	当时很多人认为两个超级大国间的战争不可避免。
The Cuban missile crisis in October 1962 created a global air of fear and pessimism, and certainly the belief that the US and the Soviet Union could not be reconciled.	1962年10月的古巴导弹危机让全球笼罩着悲观和恐惧，人们因此认定美苏之间的矛盾不可调和。
Kennedy knew better.	肯尼迪更有眼光。
He understood that much of the dangerous tension stemmed from each side’s hardliners, who acted as if peace were impossible.	他了解危险的紧张局势大多来自两国的强硬派，他们的所作所为就好像和平是不可能的。
Their actions on one side would provoke the other side’s hardline response, fueling an upward spiral of distrust that strengthened the extremes in both camps.	一方的举动会激起对方的强烈反应，并因此导致双方阵营极端势力的不信任越来越根深蒂固。
The “experts” of that era spoke of the balance of nuclear power.	那个时代的“专家”谈论的是核权力平衡。
They believed that neither side would use nuclear weapons, owing to the fear of retaliation.	他们认为双方都不会使用核武器，因为他们害怕报复。
But Kennedy recognized something far more dangerous: Accidents, misjudgments, bluffs, provocation by hardliners, or tactical mistakes could easily throw either side into panic.	但肯尼迪意识到有些因素更加危险：事故、误判、虚张声势、强硬派挑衅或者战术失误都很容易让一方陷入恐慌之中。
In the Cuban missile crisis, the US and the Soviet Union stumbled to the precipice of nuclear war, not because of any desire for one (except among a few hothead extremists), but because of a series of miscalculations and pressure exerted by hardliners.	在古巴导弹危机中，美苏迷迷糊糊就来到了核战争的悬崖边上，不是因为他们希望如此（少数暴躁的极端份子除外 ） ， 而是因为一系列的误判和强硬派施压。
Following the crisis, Kennedy was determined to pull back from the precipice for good.	危机过后，肯尼迪决心要永远脱离核战争的悬崖。
In his extraordinary “Peace Speech” of June 10, 1963, he suggested to Americans that there was a way to make peace with the Soviet Union.	在1963年6月10日非同寻常的“和平讲话”中，他告诉美国人有办法可以实现美苏和平。
Rather than issuing a list of demands, Kennedy did something far more interesting and unusual: he called upon Americans to reconsider their own attitudes about war and peace.	肯尼迪并没有简单地提出要求，而是采取了更耐人寻味也更非同寻常的举措：他呼吁美国人重新思考自己对战争与和平的态度。
“First: Let us examine our attitude toward peace itself,” Kennedy said.	“首先，我们需要审视自己的和平观 ， ” 肯尼迪说。
“Too many of us think it is impossible.	“太多人认为这不可能。
Too many think it unreal.	太多人认为这不现实。
But that is a dangerous, defeatist belief.	但这是必将导致失败的危险信念。
It leads to the conclusion that war is inevitable, that mankind is doomed, that we are gripped by forces we cannot control.	它让我们相信战争不可避免，人类注定难逃劫数，支配我们的是我们无法控制的因素。
We need not accept that view.	我们不该接受这种观点。
Our problems are manmade; therefore, they can be solved by man.”	问题是人为的，因此可以由人类自己解决 。 ”
Kennedy diagnosed the problem succinctly: “We are both caught up in a vicious and dangerous cycle in which suspicion on one side breeds suspicion on the other, and new weapons beget counter-weapons.”	肯尼迪言简意赅地给出了对问题的判断 ： “ 我们都陷入到危险的恶性循环之中，一方的怀疑引起对方的怀疑，新武器很快招来反制武装 。 ”
And his assessment of its solvability was equally concise: “[B]oth the United States and its allies, and the Soviet Union and its allies, have a mutually deep interest in a just and genuine peace and in halting the arms race.”	他对解决方法的评估也同样简单明了 ： “ 真实公正的和平及终止军备竞赛与美国及其盟国和苏联及其盟国双方的深层次利益相互吻合 。 ”
Kennedy’s speech provoked a highly positive response from his Soviet counterpart, Nikita Khrushchev, who called in the US envoy and told him that the speech was the finest by any American president since Franklin Roosevelt.	肯尼迪讲话引起苏联总统赫鲁晓夫的积极响应，赫鲁晓夫召见美国特使，告诉他这是继富兰克林·罗斯福之后美国总统最精彩的讲话。
Within a few weeks, both sides had agreed to the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.	短短几周内，双方已经就《部分禁止核试验条约》达成一致。
Five years later, the first treaty led to a second, and even more important, agreement: the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.	五年后，第一份条约引出第二份条约，最终带来了最重要的《核不扩散条约》的签署。
Kennedy had proved a powerful truth.	肯尼迪证实了一个永恒的真理。
“[H]istory teaches us that enmities between nations, as between individuals, do not last forever,” he said.	“历史告诉我们国家和个人之间的仇恨不会永远不发生变化。
“However fixed our likes and dislikes may seem, the tide of time and events will often bring surprising changes in the relations between nations and neighbors.”	无论我们的好恶看似多么不可改变，时事大潮往往会带来邻国间关系出人意料的变化 。 ”
That lesson applies powerfully today.	这条真理今天同样适用。
The US is again caught in a spiral of distrust and uncertainty with other countries (and the same is true of countless conflicts around the world that do not involve the US).	美国再次与其他国家陷入不信任不确定的漩涡之中（全世界没有美国参与的无数冲突同样也是这样的状况 ） 。
America’s conflict with Iran is one such powerful case; others include its conflicts with Cuba and North Korea, and also the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, in which the US is deeply engaged as a supporter of Israel.	美国与伊朗的冲突就是有力的证明。 此外还包括美国与古巴和朝鲜的冲突，还有以巴冲突，美国作为以色列的支持者已经深陷其中。
In all of these cases, many people consider hatred and conflict inevitable, owing to a fundamental clash of values and interests.	很多人认为在所有这些冲突中，因为基本价值观及利益互相碰撞，仇恨和矛盾是不可避免的。
But this is rarely the case.	但这种观点基本是错误的。
Even though the US and Iran are in a spiral of distrust, for example, there could be grounds for reestablishing a far healthier bilateral relationship.	以美国和伊朗为例，即使缺乏相互信任，同样不乏重建健康双边关系的理由。
To be sure, the two sides are now dangerously divided.	可以肯定，双方正处在危险的分裂之中。
Their conflict has spilled over into Syria, where the US is now planning to arm the rebellion against President Bashar al-Assad in no small part because his regime is aligned with Iran.	美伊冲突已蔓延至叙利亚，很大程度上因为巴沙尔·阿萨德总统政权支持伊朗，美国现在正计划武装反对派对抗阿萨德。
Syria’s civil war is therefore increasingly a proxy fight between Iran and the US (and other anti-Iranian countries), with Syrians dying in massive numbers as victims of somebody else’s conflict.	叙利亚内战因此日渐沦为伊朗和美国（和其他反伊国家）间的代理战争，导致大批叙利亚人沦为第三方冲突的牺牲者。
Now that the Iranian people have elected a new president, Hassan Rowhani, the opportunity for a new peace overture is at hand.	现在伊朗民众选择哈桑·鲁哈尼担任新总统，新和平提议的机会近在眼前。
Yes, there are important matters to discuss, notably Iran’s nuclear ambitions; but several countries in Iran’s neighborhood already possess nuclear weapons, threatening the entire region.	当然，很多重要问题需要讨论，尤其是伊朗的核野心；但伊朗周边几个国家已经掌握核武器，对整个区域构成威胁。
US President Barack Obama should take the next steps, both with Iran and with other countries (including North Korea and Cuba).	美国总统奥巴马在伊朗和他国（包括朝鲜和古巴）问题上应该采取后续步骤。
A decade of US secret and not-so-secret wars, drone attacks, and covert operations is enough.	十年的美国秘密战争、无人机袭击和隐蔽行动已经足够。
We now urgently need US leadership that envisions peace rather than war as the solution.	我们现在迫切需要美国领导人用和平而不是战争的手段来解决相关冲突。
Fifty years ago, Kennedy showed that peace could be achieved even in the most difficult circumstances.	五十年前，肯尼迪向世人证明即使在最艰苦的环境下也可以实现和平。
His courage, vision, eloquence, and political skills provide a model and inspiration for the US and other countries today.	他的勇气、远见、口才和政治技巧今天仍在为美国和其他国家提供灵感和模式。
Then, as now, the path to peace must always be preferred to the dead end of war.	我们必须优先选择通往和平之路，而不是通往战争的死胡同，这一点在当时和现在并没有什么不同。
	
The Mosquito Menace	蚊子的威胁
STANFORD – Mosquito-borne diseases kill millions of people annually, and cause suffering for many more.	斯坦福—蚊子传播的疾病每年要多走数百万人的生命，因此受苦的人数更要多得多。
In 2012, there were an estimated 207 million cases of malaria, leading to some 627,000 deaths.	2012年，据估计有2.07亿人罹患疟疾，其中造成627,000人死亡。
Dengue fever is a leading cause of illness and death in the tropics and subtropics, with as many as 100 million people infected each year.	登革热是热带和亚热带的主要致死病因，每年感染的人数更是高达1亿人。
And there are an estimated 200,000 cases of yellow fever annually, leading to 30,000 deaths worldwide.	此外，每年还有约200,000人罹患黄热病，造成全球30,000人死亡。
It takes only one bite from a disease-carrying mosquito to transmit a debilitating or deadly infection – and mosquitoes breed and multiply with astonishing speed.	染上令人痛苦甚至致命的疾病只需要被携带病菌的蚊子叮上一口，而蚊子以令人咋舌的速度繁殖和增加着。
Given that there are no vaccines or drug treatments for illnesses like dengue fever and West Nile virus, and that treatments for diseases like malaria are difficult to access in many at-risk areas, more effective mechanisms for controlling mosquito populations are desperately needed.	对于登革热等疾病和西尼罗河病毒，目前还没有疫苗或药物可以治疗，而对疟疾等疾病的治疗在许多高风险地区也难以获得，因此我们急需更有效的措施控制蚊子数量。
The good news is that a promising new technology is ready for field-testing.	好消息是，一项极有希望的新技术已经进入了实地测试。
It is now up to government agencies to facilitate its development.	现在，需要政府机构促进它的发展。
Today, the dominant method for reducing insect populations – the so-called “sterile insect technique” (SIT) – relies on radiation to sterilize males, which are then released into infested areas to mate.	如今，减少昆虫数量的主要手段 — — 所谓的“不育昆虫技术 ” （ SIT）主要依靠射线让雄性昆虫不育，然后将它们放回昆虫滋生区域和雌性昆虫交配。
But this approach, which has been used since the middle of the last century, has not been effective with mosquitoes, owing to their fragility.	但这一自上个世纪中叶以来就开始使用的办法对蚊子不管用，因为雄蚊子生命力太差。
Advances in molecular biology offer analogous – but far more sophisticated – solutions.	分子生物学的进步提供了类似 — — 但远为成熟 — — 的办法。
Using molecular genetic-engineering techniques, the British company Oxitec has created a new way to control the mosquito species that transmits dengue fever.	英国的Oxitec公司通过分子基因工程技术创造了控制传播登革热的蚊子种群的新方法。
Male mosquitoes are bred in the laboratory with a specific genetic mutation.	雄蚊在实验室中繁殖，它们带有一个特别的基因突变。
As a result, their offspring produce high levels of a protein that prevents their cells from functioning normally, causing them to die before reaching maturity.	于是它们的后代会大量产生一种让其细胞无法正常运转的蛋白质，使它们在成熟之前就死去。
Male mosquitoes do not bite, so their release presents no health risk, and, because their progeny die, no genetically engineered mosquitoes persist in the environment.	雄蚊不会咬人，因此释放它们不会造成健康风险，而由于它们不会有子孙后代，大自然中也不会有转基因蚊子出现。
If the males are released over a period of several months, this would, in theory, result in a marked reduction in the mosquito population.	理论上，如果在为期几个月的时间里持续释放雄蚊，蚊子数量就会大量降低。
All that is needed now is to determine whether it works in practice.	现在需要知道的是在实践中这是否管用。
Scientific research to develop products like irradiated sterile insects or the Oxitec mosquitoes proceeds progressively from more to less contained conditions – from the laboratory to confined trials to limited field trials.	开发受辐射因而不育的蚊子或Oxitec蚊子这样的产品的科学研究是在限制越来越少的环境中推进的 — — 从实验室到限制测试再到有限实地测试。
Now that Oxitec has conducted promising field trials in the Cayman Islands, Malaysia, and Brazil, it is preparing to conduct trials in other countries, including the United States.	现在，Oxitec已在开曼群岛、马来西亚和巴西进行了令人振奋的实地测试，准备在包括美国在内的其他国家展开测试。
Such trials are always appropriately controlled and monitored to ensure that they are safe and effective, with government regulation providing an extra safeguard.	这些测试会一直受到适当的控制和监控，以确保安全性和有效性，政府监管则提供了进一步的保障。
In order to determine the appropriate level of oversight, government bodies would presumably conduct a science-based risk analysis.	为了确定监督的适当水平，政府机构会预先进行基于科学的风险分析。
When it comes to genetic engineering, however, science seems to matter less than politics.	但是，对于基因工程，这与其说是科学问题，不如说是政治问题。
The fact is that molecular genetic engineering is more precise and predictable than older, cruder techniques like irradiation.	事实上，分子基因工程比更陈旧、更粗糙的技术（比如辐射）更精确、更可预测。
But, while SIT remains unregulated in most places, the regulatory reviews of genetically engineered living organisms have tended to be drawn out and excessive worldwide, with politics delaying – and sometimes even preventing – approvals.	但是，尽管SIT在许多地区不受管制，但对基因工程活体实验的监管审查总是有过度之嫌，全世界都是如此，政治拖延 — — 有时甚至是阻碍 — — 了批准。
As a result, research and development in genetic engineering is more expensive, discouraging investment and hampering innovation.	因此，基因工程的研发总是更昂贵，阻碍了投资和创新。
This is all the more problematic in the case of mosquito control, given the urgency of the problem.	在蚊子控制问题上尤其如此，而这一问题又是十万火急。
The World Health Organization’s Special Program for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases has called upon regulatory agencies to emphasize “science-based, case-by-case targeted requirements with a degree of practical parsimony,” instead of relying on “a precautionary approach that can require data to address all theoretical risks.”	世界卫生组织热带疾病研究和培训计划要求监管机构强调“基于科学的、具体案例具体分析的、带有一定程度实践谨慎性的定向要求”取代依赖“需要数据解决所有理论风险的预防性方法 ” 。
In other words, regulators should consider these innovations’ public-health costs and benefits, and expedite their review.	换句话说，监管者应该考虑创新的公共卫生成本和效益，并加快审查。
Given the degree of suffering caused by mosquito-borne diseases, government leaders must not subject genetic-engineering solutions for controlling them to the same kinds of political and populist headwinds that have impeded the approval of genetically engineered agricultural products.	蚊子传播的疾病造成着巨大的痛苦，政府领导人决不能让基因工程解决办法如同转基因农产品那样陷入政治和民粹主义阻力。
Only with pragmatic, fact-based regulation can the world realize genetic engineering’s full disease-fighting potential.	只有务实的、基于事实的监管才能让世界认识到基因工程在疾病控制方面的全部潜力。
	
Israel’s Neglected Peace Dividend	以色列忽视的和平红利
TEL AVIV – Twenty years after the Oslo Accords, the prospects for a comprehensive Israeli-Palestinian peace deal are dimmer than ever.	特拉维夫—奥斯陆协定距今已有二十年，全面的以色列-巴勒斯坦和平协定前景从未如此暗淡过。
Indeed, roughly a half-million Israeli settlers in the occupied territories (including East Jerusalem) make the creation of a contiguous Palestinian state an almost impossible mission.	事实上，约五十万占领区（包括东耶路撒冷）以色列定居者意味着建立相邻的巴勒斯坦国几乎是个不可能的任务。
So, is the renewed vigor of US President Barack Obama’s administration in the quest for peace too little, too late?	因此，美国总统奥巴马政府的重新要求和平看来是太晚、太微不足道了？
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu claims that his government has no preconditions for resuming negotiations with the Palestinians.	以色列总理内塔尼亚胡声称，他的政府没有为重启与巴谈判设置先决条件。
Meanwhile, his housing minister, Uri Ariel (himself a settler and a member of the annexationist Jewish Home party), unleashes a new wave of settlement expansion that threatens to link the 1967 border with the Jordan Valley, thus bisecting Palestinian territory.	与此同时，他的住房部长艾利尔（Uri Ariel，他本人也是占领区定居者，也是兼并主义政党犹太家园党（Jewish Home）党员）发动了新一轮定居扩张潮，骎骎然欲将1967年边境与约旦河谷连接起来，从而将巴勒斯坦领土一分为二。
Netanyahu’s own insistence on “ironclad” security arrangements is a euphemism for an Israeli presence in the Jordan Valley – and no return to the “Auschwitz borders” of 1967.	内塔尼亚胡自己也坚持“坚不可摧”的安全安排，这无非是以色列出现在约旦河谷 — — 并且再也不回1967年“奥斯维辛边界”的委婉说法。
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is too weak and too burdened by his rivalry with the hard-line Islamist Hamas – which rules in Gaza – to allow himself the political luxury of departing from the core demands of Palestinian nationalism.	巴勒斯坦总统阿巴斯太弱、受到太多的掣肘 — — 来自他的竞争对手和走强硬路线的加沙地带控制着哈马斯 — — 因此没有政治上的空间置巴勒斯坦民族主义的核心要求于不顾。
Nor does Netanyahu, an ideologue who is visibly uncomfortable with his forced support of the two-state idea, truly have a governing coalition for peace.	内塔尼亚胡也是如此，作为显而易见不满于被迫支持两国方案的空想家，他其实并没有追求和平的执政联盟。
Thus, US Secretary of State John Kerry will require great deal of creativity to reconcile Netanyahu’s position and the Palestinian precondition, recently reiterated by Abbas’s close associate Nabil Shaath, that Israel must agree to negotiate on the basis of the 1967 borders.	因此，美国国务卿科里将要求拿出大量创造性调和内塔尼亚胡的立场和巴勒斯坦的先决条件 — — 阿巴斯的亲信沙斯（Nabil Shaath）最近重申，以色列必须同意在1967年边界基础上的谈判。
Mahmoud Al-Habbash, the Palestinian minister of religious affairs, even went so far as to demand “assurances that the talks won’t fail,” because if they do, a new intifada would surely erupt.	巴勒斯坦宗教事务部长哈巴什（Mahmoud Al-Habbash）甚至要求“保证谈判不会失败 ” ， 因为如若谈判失败，几乎肯定将导致新一轮动乱爆发。
Moreover, Kerry’s peace drive is taking place in a regional environment that is not amenable to a negotiated resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.	此外，科里推动和平的努力所处的地区环境并非以巴冲突的谈判解决方案所能稳定。
The Arab Spring has turned bloody and unpredictably turbulent, further diminishing the odds for peace in Palestine.	阿拉伯之春演变成了流血和未曾预料到的混乱，这进一步降低了巴勒斯坦和平的可能。
Nor does the election of Hassan Rowhani, a relative moderate, to Iran’s presidency improve Kerry’s chances.	相对温和的鲁哈尼当选伊朗总统也无助于增加科里的胜机。
Rowhani’s victory is certainly good news for Iranians, and it may lead to a more civilized dialogue between the Islamic Republic and the international community.	鲁哈尼的胜利对伊朗人来说显然是个好消息，也有可能引出伊朗和国际社会的更加文明的对话。
But Rowhani’s presidency can hardly be expected to change Iran’s strategic objectives.	但鲁哈尼的总统任期几乎无望改变伊朗的战略目标。
Iran will continue its nuclear program, fight for the survival of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria, seek to maintain its vital alliance with key regional proxies such as Hezbollah, and defend Palestine and al-Quds (Jerusalem).	伊朗将继续其核计划，为巴沙尔·阿萨德的叙利亚政权而斗争，寻求维持与真主党等关键地区代理人的联盟，并捍卫巴勒斯坦和圣城（耶路撒冷 ） 。
If Assad defeats his opponents with the help of Hezbollah and Iran, his survival is bound to be perceived as a victory for the regional “axis of resistance” to Israel.	如若巴沙尔在真主党的帮助下打败反对者，他的转危为安将注定成为该地区“反以轴心”的胜利。
And a permanent Iranian presence in Syria would make a war between Israel and Iran practically unavoidable.	伊朗在叙利亚的持久身影也将使以色列和伊朗之间的战争变得实际不可避免。
Palestine would then be relegated to an obscure corner of the international agenda.	届时，巴勒斯坦将被沦为该地区的一个不起眼的角落。
Complicating matters further, America’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have limited its regional clout.	让局面更急复杂的事，美国的伊拉克和阿富汗战争限制了其地区实力。
The US now faces an unpredictable Middle East that is writing its own history as well – or as badly – as it can.	美国目前面对这一个不可预测的中东，后者正在尽力打造其自身历史上最好 — — 或者最坏 — — 的时代。
Syria’s internal conflict has now become a Sunni-Shia sectarian war that is spreading across the region.	叙利亚内战已成为逊尼派-什叶派之间的宗派之战，并在全地区蔓延。
The Sunni clerics who have just declared a jihad against “the Iranian regime, Hezbollah, and its sectarian allies” are the voice of millions across the Muslim world.	逊尼派神职人员刚刚宣布要对“伊朗政权、真主党及其宗派盟军”开战圣战，这是穆斯林世界几百万人民的声音。
Furthermore, waves of Syrian refugees are threatening the sustainability of the Jordanian monarchy, already roiled by profound internal cleavages.	此外，大批叙利亚难民正在威胁约旦��主制的可持续性，目前约旦已然在深刻的内部冲突中摇摇欲坠。
Hezbollah has drawn Lebanon into the Syrian conflict, setting up a showdown between Shia and Sunni at home.	真主党将黎巴嫩拖入了叙利亚冲突，在自家后院掀起了什叶派和逊尼派的大决斗。
A similar scenario is already unfolding in Iraq.	伊拉克也在出现类似的情景。
Turkey, a responsible regional power, has so far resisted being drawn into the Syrian quagmire, but its effects can be seen in the rising tensions between the country’s Sunni majority and the Shia Alevi sect.	而土耳其作为负责任的地区大国，到目前为止顶住了压力，没有卷入叙利亚乱局，但叙利亚冲突的影响可以在该国逊尼派多数人口和什叶派阿拉维派冲日益激烈的紧张中一窥端倪。
Inertia is not an adequate response in an era of revolutionary change.	对于这个革命性变化的时代，光靠惯性是不够的。
Unfortunately, Israel is missing a coherent regional strategy.	不幸的是，以色列正在错失一贯的地区战略。
Netanyahu, always on the defensive, does not view Middle East turmoil as a trigger for a proactive strategy that would use a solution to the Palestinian problem as leverage for broader positive change in the region.	内塔尼亚胡从不采取攻势，他不认为中东乱局是前瞻性战略的触发器，借助形成巴勒斯坦问题的解决方案为该地区带来更广泛的积极变化。
America, burdened by the cost of its Middle East troubles, eager to refocus on Asia, and no longer in need of Arab oil, can allow itself to leave the region to its destiny.	被中东羁绊甚深的美国急切地意欲将注意力转向亚洲，也不再需要阿拉伯的石油，它大可以脱身于中东地区之外，让后者自己决定命运。
Israel is part of the region and has a strong interest in helping to shape its future.	以色列是中东地区的一部分，也有强大的利益帮助决定中东的未来。
Israel has traditionally strived to forge alliances with the region’s minorities – Kurds, Persians, Maronites, and others.	传统上，以色列致力于与地区少数派结盟 — — 库尔德人、波斯人、马龙派（Maronite）等。
Now is the time for a major shift to an alliance with the region’s overwhelming Sunni majority.	如今，以色列应该转变方向与在中东占压倒多数的逊尼派结盟。
Israel should follow Obama, whose recent decision to arm the Syrian rebels, though belated and still ill-defined, is a choice for the Sunni alliance.	以色列应该追随奥巴马 — — 后者最近决定武装叙利亚反对派，尽管这姗姗来迟且没有成熟计划，但算得上是在选择与逊尼派结盟。
Israel should play an active role in the fall of Assad as a way to undermine the region’s “Shia crescent” and isolate its leader, Iran.	以色列应该在推翻巴沙尔、打破中东地区的“什叶新月”并鼓励其领袖伊朗的过程中扮演积极角色。
Assad’s defeat would break the “axis of resistance,” choke off Hezbollah’s arms supplies, and drive a permanent wedge between Turkey and Iran.	巴沙尔的倒台将打破“反以轴心 ” ， 切断真主党的武器供应，并在土耳其和伊朗之间打入一枚永久的楔子。
A solution to the Palestinian problem would serve such a strategy.	巴勒斯坦问题的解决方案可以充当这一战略。
It would strengthen Israel’s relations with Egypt, help to stabilize Jordan (a vital and friendly buffer state), and remove a major source of tension with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Islamist government.	它能强化以色列与埃及的关系，帮助稳定约旦（关键的、友好的缓冲国 ） ， 并移除与土耳其总理埃尔多安的伊斯兰政府的一大主要冲突源。
Most important, it would undermine Iran’s efforts to make inroads into the Arab world under the pretext of defending Palestine and Holy Jerusalem.	最重要的是，它能破坏伊朗打着捍卫巴勒斯坦和圣城耶路撒冷的旗号作恶阿拉伯世界的图谋。
	
Goodbye, Johnny	再见，约翰尼
PARIS – What better send-off for a rocker than Saturday’s vast, silent concert on the steps of a church?	巴黎—对一位摇滚乐手来说，还有什么送别方式比教堂台阶上的巨型静默音乐会更好的呢？
And what better farewell to a great performer than the one delivered by the immense crowd chanting around a body that seemed to have arranged, from the great beyond, this last demonstration of enthusiasm and love?	对一位表演者来说，还有什么告别方式比众人围绕遗体吟唱，好像这是事先安排好的展示热情和爱的方式一样更好的呢？
Herein lies the beguiling feature of the funeral of Johnny Hallyday, France’s national singer: his ability to stage-manage his destiny, right up the final hour, and the star power that his being retained even in death.	这就是法国国民歌手约翰尼·阿利代的葬礼：他就是能够这样指挥自己的命运，哪怕是在最后的时刻，他拥有的巨星实力在他身后仍能经久不衰。
The costume he chose for his last performance was oblong and white.	他给自己的最后表演选择的装扮是一个白色的长方形。
Nothing remained of his swaying hips and his howls, or of the pale eyes perpetually on the verge of laughing or crying (you never knew which).	他再也不能摇摆臀部，发出吼声，他的睡眼朦胧的眼睛再也无法做出似笑非笑，似哭非哭的表情（你永远不知道是哪一种 ） 。
And yet there he was, charisma and presence, the spell of a shaman inviting you one last time to dance the eternal chorus in the aura of his mystery and his smile.	但他的魅力和仪态仍在，就像一位巫师那样召唤你最后一次在他的神秘光环和他的微笑中跳一曲永恒之歌。
And there was the spirit of France: young and old, the French president and two of his predecessors, the novelists Philippe Labro and Daniel Rondeau, celebrities, artists, fans from 50 years ago wearing Apache fringe, a remembrance of the striking miners of Lorraine, the words of Jacques Prévert, tears shed by ordinary people.	这就是法国精神：老人和少年，法国总统和他的两位前任，小说家菲利普·拉布罗（Philippe Labro）和丹尼尔·隆多（Daniel Rondeau ） ， 名流，艺术家，穿戴阿帕奇（Apache）流苏的50多年前的歌迷，洛林罢工矿工的追忆，雅克·普雷威特（Jacques Prévert）的辞赋，普通人流下的眼泪。
And all of them seemed to be under Hallyday’s influence still: The great actor who was suddenly starkly human and at a loss.	而所偶这些似乎都仍在受到阿利代的影响：突然间沦落为不完整的凡人的伟大表演者。
The old, unsentimental crooner with a tear on his cheek.	面无表情的老歌手脸上流下清泪。
The column of bikers that descended the Champs-Elysées, which never wore its funereal name so well.	沿着爱丽舍宫鱼贯骑行的车手们，从未将葬礼的名字打扮得如此出色。
There was the Place de la Madeleine, too.	还有玛德莲广场（Place de la Madeleine ） 。
Usually so staid and cold, it echoed to the rhythm of strings with the swing of the Louisiana bayous at one moment, and at the next with the memory of the concert at the Olympia, so close but a half-century away, where the saturnine firebrand upended ten thousand hearts.	它总是如此沉着冷静，这一刻，弦韵与路易斯安纳河口的摇曳遥相呼应，下一刻，又让人想起奥林匹亚的演唱会，它好像近在眼前，实则已经过去了半个世纪，忧郁的火把让一万颗心神魂颠倒。
Here was an upwelling of emotion the likes of which France had not seen since the funerals of Victor Hugo and Edith Piaf, since the catafalque of Jean Jaurès went up the Rue Soufflot.	这种升华的情绪，自从雨果和琵雅芙（Edith Piaf）的葬礼以来，自从饶勒斯（Jean Jaurès）的灵车通过苏福洛路（Rue Soufflot）以来，从未在法国的葬礼上出现过。
A million mourners were left not knowing whether to cry, sing, throw chairs around, request an encore, or light candles.	一百万哀悼者走上街头，不知道应该哭泣，歌唱，丢椅子（throw chairs around ） ， 要求“再来一曲 ” ， 还是点燃蜡烛。
Disappearing in a final parade of passion and energy, of restlessness and quiet rebellion, of inner fissures and desire for harmony, was someone who had spent his life trying not to survive.	在激情和能量的最后游行中，在不安定和静悄悄的叛逆中，在内心的分裂和和谐的渴望中，那个毕生追逐不要生存的人消失了。
And on that day, he was so well mourned that his absence seemed like part of a show, somehow making us forget that he was no longer with us.	在这一天，他极尽哀荣，他的告别就像是一场表演，让我们忘记了他已经不再与我们同在。
Abiding in each of us was the Johnny that moved us all: the youth spent with a traveling act, like Gautier’s Captain Fracasse; the father, a character out of Modiano, who, between bouts of drinking, pawned the gifts given to him by his abandoned son.	感动我们所有人的约翰尼仍住在我们心中：一直在旅行的男人，就像戈蒂埃（Gautier）的弗朗卡司船长（Captain Fracasse ） ； 莫迪亚诺（Modiano）的“呼儿将出换美酒”的父亲角色。
And then there was the ’60s rocker with the eyes of a sad wolf and cheekbones hewn by Giacometti, the Catcher in the Rye mood, and a melancholy so intensely hopeless that it seemed to condemn him to live on the edge of every form of excess.	还有60年代的摇滚歌手们，他们的眼睛就像悲狼，他们颧骨像是被贾科梅蒂（Giacometti）切削过，他们的情绪像是《麦田里的守望者 》 ， 他们抑郁到绝望，好像在控诉他的生活各种不知节制。
He was the consummate artist of the French scene, a chameleon beamed out on satellite TV, dripping with fake sweat and real glitz, an artist who, like a novelist, confessed as a way of lying.	他是法国舞台上的完美艺术家，卫星频道上光芒四射的变色龙，流着假汗水，闪耀真光芒，一位像小说家那样用谎言的方式坦白自己的艺术家。
Hallyday was the child of a generation that watched American GIs enter Paris and that invented for itself an American ascendance.	阿利代是看着美国大兵进入巴黎、产生美国支配一切的感情的那一代人的孩子。
America was cigarettes, Levi’s, and Coca-Cola.	美国就是烟草，是李维斯，是可口可乐。
But it was also the languor of the blues, Nashville, and the green light that he saw gleaming at dawn after nights soaked in alcohol and amphetamines.	但它也是慵懒的蓝调，是纳什维尔（Nashville ） ， 是他在浸透着酒精和安非他命的长夜尽头所看到的隐隐闪现的绿光。
When this distraught colossus of sorrow, the unsleeping and suicidal cowboy, offered his body in sacrifice to the camera and to the mob of entranced fans, he struck François Mauriac as a Mephistophelean figure.	这个哀伤到发狂的巨匠、警醒的自杀牛仔（suicidal cowboy ） ， 将自己牺牲的遗体献给了镜头和着迷的“粉丝”群，此时，他击中了作为反派人物的弗朗索瓦·莫亚力克（François Mauriac ） 。
Here was the hero, motley and scarred, whose glory seemed like a wound, whose victories were stigmata, and who, from metamorphosis to metamorphosis, embodied what is wrongly called pop or variety but that was, in him, more like fallen greatness or the lament of a cleverly disguised poet.	这个英雄百衲衣，刀疤脸，他的光荣就像是一个伤口，他的胜利就像是圣痕（stigmata ） ， 他从变态走向变态（from metamorphosis to metamorphosis ） ， 表达着被错误地称为流行或变体（variety ） ， 但对他来说更像是坠落的伟大（fallen greatness）或对巧妙掩饰的诗人的哀叹的东西。
And, at the end, there was King Lear triumphant, the wax face with the periwinkle gaze, survivor of an era whose heroes perished before the age of 30, one who knew that his survival was a miracle.	在这方面，有一个得意洋洋的李尔王，一张长着一双蔓长春花色的眼睛的蜡色的脸，他从英雄不到30岁便凋零的时代存活下来，知道他活下来是一个奇迹。
And then, finally, there were those near-deaths in the manner of Bossuet (“Johnny is dying!	终于，他以波苏哀（Bossuet）的方式濒临死亡 （ “ 约翰尼快死了！
Johnny is dead!”): he would always revive, right up to the very last time, when he lived again in Paris for a few hours under a cold December sun.	约翰尼死了 ！ ” ） ： 他会永远活着，直到最后一刻，他在寒冷的12月的太阳下，在巴黎复活几个小时。
The Vatican of literature that is the Swedish Academy has, with the Nobel coronation of Bob Dylan, rescued song from its canonical hell.	文学的圣殿瑞典科学院授予鲍勃·迪伦（Bob Dylan）诺贝尔奖，将歌曲从规范的地狱中救出。
In the case of Johnny Hallyday, it is perhaps not too farfetched to believe that this man of sphinx-like mystery is now, like Baudelaire, “a block of granite surrounded by vague fear” whose “fierce nature sings only to the rays of the setting sun.”	对于约翰尼·阿利代来说，认为这个高深莫测的神秘人现在就像波德莱尔那样，成为“一块花岗石，周围是模糊的恐惧 ” ， 其“暴脾气只为夕阳引吭高歌”恐怕亦不为过。
	
The Immorality of Boris Johnson and Donald Trump	鲍里斯·约翰逊和唐纳德·特朗普的不道德行为
LONDON – In a 2013 press conference, then-recently inaugurated Pope Francis famously said that, when it comes to sexual orientation, including past homosexual acts, “who am I to judge?”	伦敦 — — 在2013年的一次新闻发布会上，当时刚刚继任的弗朗西斯教皇尽人皆知地表示，如果说到性取向，包括过去的同性恋行为 ， “ 我有什么资格去评判别人 ？ ”
Should we take a similarly non-judgmental approach to the past personal behavior of our political leaders?	我们是否应当用同样非评判性的态度去对待政治领袖过去的个人行为？
The question is acutely relevant today in both the United States and the United Kingdom.	这个问题在今天的美国和英国都十分重要。
US President Donald Trump, who has already reached the height of political power in his country, and former UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who aspires to keep rising in the ranks, have in common not just their crude nationalism, but also their apparent inability to control their sexual appetites.	美国总统唐纳德·特朗普已经登上了该国政治权力的巅峰，而一心渴望步步高升的前英国外交大臣鲍里斯·约翰逊与特朗普相同的不仅是粗暴的民族主义，而且上述两人显然都无法控制自己的性欲。
Trump’s extramarital affairs are common knowledge, despite hefty pay-offs intended to silence his sexual partners, such as the adult film performer and stripper known as Stormy Daniels.	尽管特朗普不惜重金意在使性伴侣保持沉默，比如成人电影明星兼脱衣舞女斯托米·丹尼尔斯，但特朗普的婚外情依旧人尽皆知。
Though Trump is far from the first US president with a long record of adultery, he stands out for the crudeness of his remarks about women, including the infamous “grab ’em by the pussy” comment, exposed during the campaign.	尽管特朗普远不是第一位长期通奸的美国总统，但若论对女性的粗暴评论恐怕无人能出其右，包括在竞选期间爆出臭名昭著的“抓住她们屁股”的粗鄙丑闻。
As for Johnson, reports are circulating that his wife has kicked him out over an affair.	至于约翰逊，有报道称他因为婚外情而被妻子赶出了家门。
While this is hardly his first – nor even the first time he has been given the boot – there are questions now about whether this will hurt his political ambitions, which many believe were the main motivation behind his decision to act as a leader of the campaign to withdraw the UK from the European Union.	但这一次对他来讲并非初犯 — — 甚至不是他第一次因此被赶出家门 — — 现在已经有人开始质疑这是否会损害他的政治野心，许多人认为恰恰是因为这样的野心他才决定成为英国脱欧运动的领导人。
But is it appropriate to judge political leaders based on their sex lives, as many have been wont to do?	但就像许多人一直想做的那样，基于性生活来对政治领袖进行评判是否合适？
The answer, in my opinion, is no.	在我看来，答案是否定的。
Of course, actions like sexual harassment or assault should inform our assessment of a leader.	勿庸置疑，性骚扰或攻击行为理应成为我们对领导人评价的一部分。
But while Trump has faced such accusations, Johnson has not.	但尽管特朗普曾经面临这样的指控，而约翰逊却从未有过这样的先例。
And, ultimately, we do not elect people to political office because we want them to act as standard bearers for our subjective, varied, and evolving definitions of morality.	而且归根结底，我们选举某人担任政治职务并不是因为希望他们成为我们主观、多变而且不断发展的道德标准的践行者。
Someone who has been unfaithful to his or her spouse can be a skilled leader, just as a faithful wife or husband can be a poor one.	对配偶不忠的人可能是一位伟大的领导者，就像忠实的妻子或丈夫也可能成为一位糟糕的领导人。
Nonetheless, there are plenty of other problems with the leadership of both Trump and Johnson, who resigned from his post as foreign secretary in July over his opposition to the compromises that Prime Minister Theresa May’s government decided it would be willing to make in the Brexit negotiations with the EU.	尽管如此，特朗普和约翰逊的领导还存在不少其他问题，后者于今年7月辞去了其外交大臣的职务，因为他反对特雷莎·梅首相领导的政府在与欧盟进行的脱欧谈判中采取的妥协姿态。
While Johnson has some rhetorical skill – which he has been using with increasing vigor to whip up support for a “hard Brexit” – the general view is that he was a hopeless diplomat, always preferring a cheap joke to a serious brief.	尽管约翰逊有一定的演说技巧 — — 他一直利用这些技巧来煽动对英国“硬脱欧”的支持 — — 但外界普遍认为他是一个毫无希望的外交官，总是喜欢用廉价的笑话来取代严肃的发布会。
During his stint as foreign secretary, Johnson was a near-constant cause of embarrassment for the UK, with gaffe after gaffe leaving Britain’s friends abroad with their heads in their hands.	在任职外交大臣期间，约翰逊不断令英国感到尴尬，他一次又一次的失态令英国的外国盟友痛苦地捂住脑袋。
Since leaving that position, Johnson has not cleaned up his act.	离任外交大臣后，约翰逊也没有改变他的行为。
Just last month, he made the Islamophobic declaration that Muslim women wearing niqabs resemble “bank robbers” and “letter boxes.”	就在上个月，他还在宣扬伊斯兰恐惧情绪，称蒙着面纱的穆斯林妇女令人联想起“银行抢劫犯”和“邮桶”的样子。
Soon after, Johnson described May’s EU negotiating position as being tantamount to wrapping “a suicide vest around the British constitution” and handing the detonator to the EU.	此后不久，约翰逊形容梅的脱欧谈判立场相当于“为英国宪法披上自杀式炸弹背心 ” ， 并将引爆装置交给欧盟。
The comment was tasteless, to put it mildly, not least because 22 people (including children) were killed by a suicide bomber at a concert in Manchester last year.	哪怕是从最善意的角度，他的评论也极其乏味，尤其因为在去年曼彻斯特举行的一场音乐会上，一名自杀式炸弹袭击者杀害了22人（其中也包括儿童 ） 。
Such statements are clearly not befitting of a British political leader, much like many of the racially charged and otherwise incendiary comments (not to mention actions) that Trump has made.	就像特朗普许多种族主义及其他煽动性言论（更不要说行动）一样，这样的言论显然不符合英国领导人的形象要求。
But these leaders’ failures run even deeper.	但这些领导人的失败其实更为深入。
To understand them, it is worth looking at three reputable leaders who died this summer: former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, former British Foreign Secretary and NATO Secretary-General Peter Carrington, and US Senator John McCain.	要想理解这一点，只需回顾一下今年夏天故去的三位备受尊敬的领导人：前联合国秘书长科菲·安南、前英国外交大臣兼北约秘书长彼得·卡林顿，还有美国参议员约翰·麦凯恩。
Having worked with Annan and for Carrington, I can vouch for their grace, honor, and commitment to truth.	因为有幸曾与安南共事并曾为卡林顿工作，我可以为他们的魅力、荣耀以及对真理的执着做出证明。
McCain plainly had the same qualities, not to mention a level of personal bravery far beyond what is expected of most of us (though it should be noted that Carrington was also a war hero).	麦凯恩显然具有相同的品质，更不用说其个人的英勇程度远超我们多数人（应当指出的是卡林顿本人也是战斗英雄 ） 。
These leaders’ combination of honor and commitment to truth – two attributes that are intrinsically connected – is nowhere to be seen in Trump or Johnson.	这些领导人的荣誉和对真理的承诺 — — 这两种性格特征从本质上具有相互联系 — — 在特朗普或约翰逊身上根本无迹可寻。
No one would suggest that political leaders must respond to every question they are asked with entirely frank answers.	没有人会要求政治领袖必须完全坦诚地回答每一个提问。
That would be to expect behavior far above and beyond what is normal.	这种要求所包含的期待远远高于和超过正常水平。
Dealing with life’s predicaments sometimes demands, to borrow the language of former UK Cabinet Secretary Robert Armstrong, that we are somewhat economical with the truth.	面对生活的困境有时需要，借用前英国内阁大臣罗伯特·阿姆斯特朗的话讲，我们要对真理有节制的使用。
But there is a big difference between some economizing, as even honorable leaders like McCain and Carrington have surely done, and being a serial liar, as is the case with Trump and Johnson.	但某种程度上有所节制 — — 就像麦凯恩和卡林顿等令人尊敬的领导人也曾做过的那样 — — 和像特朗普及约翰逊那样成为一名连环骗子之间有着很大的不同。
Trump typically says whatever is in his short-term interest, though sometimes it seems that he does not even know what the truth is.	特朗普所说的话往往都符合他的短期利益，尽管有时看上去他对真相怎样完全不知情。
Even his own lawyer is reputed to have described him as a liar.	就连他自己的律师都将他形容为骗子。
Yet Trump’s dishonesty runs even deeper: his entire nationalist political platform is based on the mendacious notion that America needs to be made great again.	但特朗普的不诚实表现层次更深：他的整个民族主义政治纲领都是基于美国需要再次伟大的虚假理念。
Yet America was great before Trump, and his behavior – riding roughshod over international agreements, trashing allies, and pursuing protectionist trade measures – will only undermine that greatness by, among other things, depleting the country’s formidable stock of soft power.	而美国早在特朗普上台之前就是伟大的，而他的所作所为 — — 粗暴对待国际协议、践踏盟友以及采取保护主义贸易措施 — — 只会破坏美国的伟大，并且耗尽该国强大的软实力储备。
Similarly, Johnson’s Brexit campaign was based entirely on deception, crackpot economics, and vainglorious wishful thinking.	同样，约翰逊的脱欧运动完全基于欺骗、狂想经济和自负的一厢情愿。
A healthy democracy depends on an honest exchange of ideas and opinions, against a background of shared respect for facts and truth.	在共同尊重事实和真相的基础上，健康的民主制度取决于诚实的思想和意见交换。
The moral case against Trump and Johnson is not that they have been unfaithful to their wives, but rather that they subvert these conditions by lying relentlessly to the people they are supposed to represent.	特朗普和约翰逊违反道德准则不在于他们背叛了他们的妻子，而在于他们肆无忌惮地向本应该代表的民众撒谎而破坏了这些条件。
	
What Good Is an Arab Military Alliance?	阿拉伯军事同盟有什么益处？
LONDON – The framework nuclear agreement that Iran and the P-5 (China, Britain, France, Russia, and the United States) plus Germany recently reached represents progress on one major security challenge in the Middle East.	伦敦 — — 不久前达成的伊朗和P-5（中、英、法、俄、美）集团加德国的核框架协议代表我们在中东主要安全问题上取得了进步。
But, as some Arab countries move to establish a joint military force, another security question is emerging: Will such an alliance leave the region better or worse off, particularly given today’s growing Sunni-Shia divide?	但阿拉伯国家组建联合军队又带来另一个安全隐患：这样的联盟将对地区产生何种影响，尤其考虑到今天不断加剧的逊尼-什叶派分裂？
A nine-country Saudi-led coalition, which includes Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Jordan, is already carrying out airstrikes against the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen – an effort that Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei recently declared will end with the Saudis’ “noses [being] rubbed to the soil.”	以沙特为首的九国联军，包括埃及、阿联酋、科威特和约旦已经在对伊朗支持的也门胡塞叛军发动空袭 — — 伊朗最高领袖哈梅内伊日前宣称沙特将在这场行动中“摔个狗啃泥 ” 。
Yet Egypt’s president, General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, has indicated that the coalition’s mandate may be extended beyond Yemen.	但埃及总统阿卜杜勒 - 法塔赫·塞西将军已经表示联军的授权可能不仅局限在也门境内。
But what is that mandate?	但授权内容究竟是什么？
A few objectives can be excluded from the start.	某些目标可以在一开始就可以排除。
For example, post-conflict democratization cannot be the goal, given that Arab regimes lack the credentials or knowhow to craft democracies, and their militaries are neither willing nor able to assist in the process.	比方说目标不会是战后民主化，因为阿拉伯政权不具备建设民主政权的资质或知识，且军队既不能也不愿从旁协助。
Similarly, humanitarian intervention can be ruled out, owing not only to most Arab regimes’ lack of experience and inglorious human-rights records, but also because none of the official statements related to the founding of the joint force have remotely suggested that upholding human rights was ever a concern.	此外，人道主义干预也可以排除，因为多数阿拉伯政权不仅缺乏经验且有不光彩的人权纪录，还因为与组建联军相关的官方声明丝毫没有提及捍卫人权是他们所关注的问题。
Stabilization might be an objective, but only if the relevant governments can agree on shared threats and how to address them.	稳定局势或许是目的之一，但前提是相关政府能就共同威胁和应对方式达成一致。
They could, for example, take the classic “balance of power/terror” approach, by intervening to undermine the more powerful actor in a conflict, force it to the negotiating table, and dictate the terms of any compromise, thereby ensuring that they benefit from the newly created status quo.	比方说，他们可以采用经典的“权力/恐怖均势”之道，通过干预破坏冲突中较强一方的实力，迫使其坐到谈判桌前，并且制定妥协条件，从而确保他们能从最新形成的现状中受益。
But the rise of Arab military coalitions raises serious concerns, not least because the history of Arab-led military interventions – unlike those carried out by the West in places like Bosnia, Kosovo, and even Libya – does not contain any promising precedent.	但阿拉伯军事联盟的崛起引发了严重关切，这不仅因为以阿拉伯为首的军事干预史从未有过成功的先例 — — 不像西方在波斯尼亚、科索沃甚至利比亚等地进行的军事干预。
Such interventions were usually aimed at empowering a proxy political force over its military and political rivals, instead of averting humanitarian disaster or institutionalizing a non-violent conflict-resolution mechanism following a war.	上述干预措施通常目的是协助代理政治势力战胜其军事政治对手，而不是为避免人道主义灾难或在战后建设非暴力的冲突解决机制。
Egypt’s military intervention in Yemen in the 1960s is a case in point.	20世纪60年代埃及军事干预也门就是一个很好的例子。
By late 1965, Egyptian President Gamel Abdel Nasser had sent 70,000 troops in Yemen to support a republican coup against royalist forces.	到1965年末，埃及总统纳赛尔派遣70，000部队到也门支持反对皇家军队的共和党政变。
Despite using prohibited chemical weapons against Yemeni guerillas from 1963 to 1967 – a first in an intra-Arab conflict – Egypt failed to achieve its objectives.	尽管从1963到1967年对也门游击队使用了违禁的化学武器 — — 这是阿拉伯内部冲突中首次使用化学武器 — — 埃及依然未能达到自己的目的。
On top of its military humiliation, Egypt’s international reputation suffered, with the United Nations General Assembly condemning the Egyptian forces’ use of banned chemical weapons against villages that supported the monarchy.	埃及不仅在军事上遭受屈辱，国际声誉也同样遭受损害，联合国大会谴责埃及军队使用违禁化学武器对付那些支持君主制的村落。
The adventure also took a heavy economic toll; by 1965, Egypt had run up a foreign debt of nearly $3 billion, forcing it to add a “defense tax” to finance the Yemen war.	此次冒险行动也付出了沉重的经济代价；到1965年，埃及所借外债已接近30亿美元，迫使其出台所谓“国防税”来为也门战争筹集经费。
The Syria-dominated “Arab Deterrent Force” did not fare much better when it intervened in Lebanon’s civil war in the 1980s, failing either to end the brutal fighting or to secure vulnerable Palestinian refugees.	20世纪80年代叙利亚主导“阿拉伯威慑部队”干预黎巴嫩内战的情况也并未好到哪去，既未能结束那场残酷的战争，也未能保护弱势的巴勒斯坦难民群体。
After 1982, when the Lebanese government failed to extend the ADF’s mandate, it turned into a purely Syrian military force – one that ended up committing some of the worst atrocities against Palestinian factions and refugees in the so-called “War of the Camps” in 1985.	1982年黎巴嫩政府未能延续“阿拉伯威慑部队”授权后，该部队演变成一支纯粹的叙利亚部队 — — 这支部队随后在1985年所谓“难民营战争”中上演了针对巴勒斯坦派别和难民的最恐怖的屠杀行为。
Brief and less complex interventions were also unsuccessful in ending violent crises – and in some cases even exacerbated them.	时间较短且不那么复杂的干预也未能成功结束暴力危机 — — 在某些情况下甚至令危机进一步加剧。
A clear example is the recent Egyptian airstrikes in Libya, which have not only undermined the UN-led peace process in a deeply divided country, but have also empowered the most extreme elements.	最近埃及空袭利比亚就是明显的实例，埃及的空袭不仅破坏了这个严重分裂国家由联合国主导的和平进程，并且使某些最极端份子借此扩充势力。
Of course, history is not a definitive guide to the future; an Arab-led intervention today could turn out very differently.	当然，单凭历史并不能确定未来的走势；今天由阿拉伯主导的干预可能取得不同的效果。
But there is little to indicate that it will; indeed, despite hundreds of Saudi airstrikes on Houthi-controlled military bases and seaports, the rebels continue to advance.	但事情向这个方向发展的证据并不充分；事实上，尽管沙特对胡塞控制的军事基地和港口进行了数百次空袭，但叛军推进的势��并未得到遏制。
If emerging Arab military coalitions are to avoid the mistakes of past interventions, their members must reconsider their approach, including the structural deficiencies that contributed to past failures.	如果新成立的阿拉伯军事联盟想要避免过去干预行动的错误，各成员国必须重新思考自己的做法，包括哪些结构性缺陷曾经导致失利。
Many factors affect the outcome of a military intervention in a civil war, especially if it involves a ground offensive.	尤其当涉及地面进攻时，将有诸多因素影响对内战的军事干预。
In particular, Arab leaders should focus on revising the processes by which national-security policy is formulated, improving civil-military relations, providing the relevant training in peacekeeping and peace-building, reforming the political culture, and addressing socio-psychological complexes.	阿拉伯国家领导人尤其应注重修改国家安全政策的制定程序、改善军民关系、提供维和及和平建设等相关培训、改革政治文化并解决社会心理层面的复杂问题。
If Arab leaders fail to overcome these deficiencies, the latest Arab force could become the Middle East’s newest source of anti-democratic, sectarian-based instability, potentially intensifying the Sunni-Shia conflict.	如果阿拉伯领导人未能克服上述缺陷，新组建的阿拉伯联军可能演变为加剧逊尼什叶派冲突的中东最新的反民主宗派势力。
That is the last thing the region needs.	中东地区最不希望看到这样的结果。
	
Joking about Science	科学的玩笑
ITHACA, NEW YORK – An apocryphal story sometimes heard among physicists concerns a toast, proposed by his Cambridge University colleagues, to J. J. Thomson’s discovery of the electron in 1897: “To the electron: may it never be of use to anyone!”	纽约伊萨卡 — — 在自然科学家中间有时会听到一则杜撰的故事，讲的是剑桥大学同事在举杯祝贺1897年J. J.
Pure mathematicians supposedly tell a similar joke about their profession.	汤姆生发现电子时说 ： “ 为电子干杯：预祝它永远不会对任何人有用 ！ ” 据说纯数学家也经常对自己的职业开同样的玩笑。
Why should it be considered witty to celebrate the uselessness of knowledge?	为什么人们会把庆祝知识无用看作一种诙谐的态度？
I witnessed a similar attitude from a cosmologist when I participated in a radio show a few years ago: the host remarked to him that his research “has virtually no practical applicability,” to which he quickly replied, “I’m proud of that, yes.”	几年前，我在参与一档广播节目时曾亲眼目睹一位宇宙学家抱有同样的态度：当主持人说他的研究“几乎没有任何实际用处”时，他很快回答说 ， “ 是这样，我感到非常骄傲 。 ”
These jokes all seem to rely on the same assumption: everyone thinks that knowledge, especially scientific knowledge, should be useful.	这些玩笑似乎有赖于同样一种假设：所有人都认为知识，特别是科学知识，应该有某种用处。
So it’s funny to boast that one’s own brand of knowledge, whether experimental physics, mathematics, or cosmology, is useless.	因此不管是实验物理学、数学或宇宙学，吹嘘自己的知识无用显得非常好笑。
But the joke wouldn’t work if there were not at the same time another widely shared assumption that scientific knowledge has a value independent of any practical use.	但如果不是同时有另外一种假设公认科学知识的价值不依赖于任何实际用途的话，这样的玩笑恐怕也站不住脚。
After all, it would not be funny if a charity dedicated to famine relief celebrated its own ineffectiveness; practical value in that case would be paramount, because it would be the only real reason for the charity to exist.	毕竟，如果某家致力于赈济饥荒的慈善机构庆贺自己效率低下，将不会有人因此感到好笑。 那种情况下实际价值是重中之重，因为它是慈善机构存在的唯一真正理由。
So, even though potential usefulness is the reason why governments devote so much money to scientific research, people really expect more from science than that.	因此，就算潜在的实用性是政府投入巨资进行科研的原因所在，人们对科学的实际期待却有所不同。
On this view, science also has a quite different, higher aim: understanding the natural world.	从这个角度看，科学还有理解自然世界这样一个截然不同的更高目标。
Einstein may have drawn US President Franklin Roosevelt’s attention to the possibility of making nuclear weapons, but he is chiefly remembered for his profound ideas about the nature of the universe.	爱因斯坦用来吸引美国总统富兰克林·罗斯福的或许是制造核武器的可能性，但他为世人所铭记还是因为有关宇宙自然的深邃理念。
More recent scientific gurus, such as Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking, have presented a similar image to the public.	更近的科学权威，比如卡尔·萨根和斯蒂芬•霍金，也有着与爱因斯坦相似的公众形象。
Science from this perspective is about natural philosophy, an enterprise that seeks to acquire deep understanding of the world regardless of whether that knowledge can be put to use.	从这个角度看，科学也就是自然哲学，它追求对世界更深刻的理解，而不关心这些知识能否付诸应用。
Jokes also betray a certain uneasiness about the apparent contradictions that they reveal. In this case, the uneasiness derives from a fundamental uncertainty about which of the two faces of science, natural philosophy or instrumentality, represents its true character. Is science really about understanding the world, with instrumentality being a matter of fortuitous spin-offs?	这样的玩笑也在某种程度上暴露出对显而易见矛盾的不安和局促。 此时此地，这种不安来源于人们对于自然哲学和功用性这两个侧面究竟哪一面能代表科学真正属性的疑惑。
Or is it really about putting the natural world to human uses, with natural philosophy being little more than a language to account for why certain techniques work?	科学难道真是为了理解世界，而实用性不过是一条偶然的岔路？ 还是科学的真正含义是让自然世界为人类所用，而自然哲学则不过是一种语言，可以解释为什么某些技术能够发挥作用？
The nineteenth century invented the familiar terms “pure” and “applied” science as a way of reconciling these alternative understandings.	“纯科学”和“应用科学”这两个耳熟能详的名词出现在19世纪，上述两种不同的理解也因此实现了统一。
Pure science, as the name suggests, is presented as the “real thing,” untainted by practical considerations and rooted in properly conducted empirical and theoretical investigation of nature.	纯科学就像这个名称所表现的那样，被人们理解为“核心问题 ” ， 它没有被有关实际的考量所沾染，以来自自然的正确的经验和理论调查为根基。
Applied science takes the knowledge provided by pure science and puts it to work.	应用科学则是把纯科学提供的知识运用到实践中去。
But that straightforward picture bears little resemblance to the complexities of real scientific activity: if applied science involved nothing more than the application of the results of pure science, there would be no need for “research and development” departments in manufacturing corporations, or research laboratories at chemical or electronics companies.	但这种直截了当的描述并不能表现出实际科学活动的复杂性：如果应用科学仅限于把纯科学的成果付诸应用，那么制造企业就没有必要设立“研究与发展部 ” ， 化工或电子企业也没有必要设立科研实验室。
The instrumental achievements of science would depend solely on the scraps falling from the pure scientist’s table.	科学的实用成就将完全取决于从纯科学家桌上漏下的碎屑。
In fact, the two faces of science are much more intimately interwoven – less like faces than like two ingredients of a thoroughly stirred mixture.	实际上，科学的两个侧面关系更加紧密 — — 与其说是它们是不同的侧面还不如说是彻底混合在一起的两种成份更妥当。
“Truth and utility,” wrote Francis Bacon, the early seventeenth-century English philosopher and statesman, “are the very same things.”	十七世纪早期英国哲人兼政治家弗兰西斯·培根写道 ， “ 求真和致用其实是一回事 。 ”
In other words, the truth of beliefs about the world is guaranteed only by the capacity of those beliefs to be turned into actions that produce the practical outcomes that human beings desire.	换句话讲，只有有能力将信仰转化为人类所期望的实际结果才能保障与世界相关的信仰的真实。
What we understand as the instrumentality of science was, for Bacon, nothing but the other side of the scientific coin.	在培根看来，我们心目中的科学的实用性不过是硬币的另外一面而已。
Where the poet John Keats wrote “Beauty is truth, truth beauty,” Bacon might have said, “Utility is truth, truth utility”—as long as we take “utility” in a very broad sense.	诗人约翰·济慈曾经写道“美即是真，真即是美 ， ” 而只要我们从广义的角度理解“致用 ” ， 培根或许会说“致用即求真，求真即致用 ” 。
But we don’t believe Bacon, either.	但我们也不能盲从培根。
Like Bacon, we value utility because it seems to lend credibility to the claims that science makes about the nature of the world – science is true because it works.	像培根一样，我们因致用能增加科学的可信度而看重致用 — — 科学因致用而真实。
But, at the same time, we won’t allow science to be reduced to practical utility, because that would destroy its intellectual status, as well as the intellectual status of scientists themselves, and would prevent science from giving explanations.	但与此同时，我们又不能允许将科学等同于实际应用，因为这样就破坏了科学和科学家们的思想地位，从而妨碍科学对自然现象做出解释。
So science must retain its claim to being natural philosophy, too.	因此科学仍必须保持其自然哲学的本来面目。
Sometimes we believe that science is natural philosophy, and sometimes we believe that science is instrumentality.	有时我们认为科学是一种自然哲学，有时又认为科学即应用。
But in fact it’s both simultaneously, neither “pure” nor “applied.”	但实际上科学同时兼具两者的特性，既非“纯粹”又非“应用 ” 。
If we could acknowledge that, we wouldn’t be joking about it.	如果我们认识到这一点，就不会再开这样的玩笑了。
	
Finishing Off Hunger	结束饥饿
ROME – At least 842 million people worldwide suffer from chronic hunger – a nearly 1.5% decrease from the 854 million estimated for 2010-2012.	罗马 — — 虽然比2010-2012年估算的8.54亿人减少近1.5 % ， 但世界仍有至少8.42亿人常年忍饥挨饿。
Clearly, while some progress has been made, the world still has a long way to go to eradicate under-nutrition.	很明显虽然已经取得了一定进展，但根除营养不良还有很多工作要做。
As world leaders attempt to determine the best way forward, a report published jointly this year by the Food and Agriculture Organization, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, and the World Food Program, can serve as an important resource. “The State of Food Insecurity in the World" (SOFI 2013) provides updated estimates of under-nutrition and progress toward achieving the hunger targets set by the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the World Food Summit (WFS).	在世界领导人试图确定最佳方案过程中，世界粮农组织、国际农业发展基金和世界粮食计划署今年发表的一份联合报告可以作为重要资源加以利用。 《2013年世界粮食不安全状况》报告（SOFI 2013）估测了最新的营养不良状况，以及实现千年发展目标（MDGs）和世界粮食首脑会议（WFS）设定的消除饥饿目标的最新进展。
Progress on the MDGs has been uneven.	千年发展目标的进展状况很不均衡。
While many countries in the developing world – home to 827 million of the world's undernourished (compared to 838 million in 2010-2012) – have moved toward halving, by 2015, the share of hungry people relative to 1990, the average rate of decline is inadequate to meet the target in the next two years.	尽管营养不良人口占8.27亿的众多发展中国家（2010-2012年这一数字为8.38亿）到2015年可能实现饥饿人口占比较1990年减半，但平均下降速度距两年后实现目标还相去甚远。
The more ambitious WFS target of halving the total number of hungry people worldwide is even more distant, with the number of undernourished people having fallen by only 17% since 1990-1992.	世界粮食首脑会议全球饥饿人口减半的宏伟目标更加遥不可及， 1990-1992年来只减少了17%的营养不良人口。
As SOFI 2013 points out, progress toward eradicating hunger and undernourishment has slowed since 2000, when food prices began to rise, following almost a half-century of decline.	正如《2013年世界粮食不安全状况》报告所指出的那样，2000年来消除饥饿和营养不良的步伐有所放缓，粮价在经历近半个世纪的下降后开始重拾升势。
Although rapid economic growth has boosted per capita incomes in much of the developed world, income gains are not spread evenly, leaving hundreds of millions of people to face higher food prices without sufficient increases in income.	虽然经济快速增长提振了许多发达国家的人均收入，但增收状况并不均匀，导致数亿人在没有充分增收的情况下面临更高的粮价。
The World Bank originally defined its “dollar a day" extreme-poverty threshold principally in terms of the amount of food one needed to purchase to avoid hunger.	世行起初主要是以避免挨饿所需购买的粮食来界定其“每天一美元”的极端贫困线。
But subsequent adjustments – such as to $1.25 per day for 2005 – appear to have lost this link.	但此后所进行的调整（比方说2005年的每天1.25美元）却似乎不再坚持这一原则。
Today's extreme-poverty line is inadequate to avoid being undernourished – in Nicaragua, for example.	今天的极端贫困线已经不足以避免营养不良的状况 — — 以尼加拉瓜为例。
Although the share of people living in extreme poverty in 1990 was halved by 2010, progress will have to accelerate considerably to halve the prevalence of under-nutrition by 2015.	虽然1990年已经实现了极端贫困人口减半，但2015年要想实现营养不良减半的目标其进展还需要大大加快。
Meanwhile, despite declining expatriate employment and incomes in the last half-decade, remittances have helped to fight poverty, reduce hunger, improve diets, and increase agricultural investment.	同时，尽管过去五年里外籍人士的就业和收入均有所下降，但汇款在消除贫困、减少饥饿、改善饮食和增加农业投资等领域都有很大帮助。
Globally, remittances amount to nearly three times the size of official development assistance, which has been an easy target for budget cuts by rich countries in recent years.	全球汇款金额为官方发展援助额的三倍，近年来官方发展援助已成为富国削减预算的重灾区。
The SOFI 2013 report also describes the persistent and marked disparities among regions.	《2013年世界粮食不安全状况》报告还描述了地区间的持续显著差异。
East and Southeast Asia and Latin America – which have experienced particularly rapid economic growth in recent decades – have fared the best in terms of reducing hunger.	近数十年来经济发展尤其迅速的东亚、东南亚和拉美在减少饥饿方面的进展最为显著。
Sub-Saharan Africa has, after a quarter-century of economic stagnation, made some progress over the last decade, but it maintains the highest rate of under-nutrition worldwide.	撒哈拉以南非洲地区在四分之一世纪的经济停滞后终于在过去10年取得了进步，但那里的营养不良率仍然是全世界最高的。
Gains in South Asia and North Africa have been modest, while conditions in West Asia have actually worsened.	南亚和北非的进展一直不大，而西亚的状况反而有所恶化。
Hunger and undernourishment (which reflects only dietary energy supply) often coexist.	饥饿和营养不良（仅反映膳食能量供应）往往同时存在。
But, in most places, under-nutrition rates – as indicated by, say, the proportion of stunted children – are much higher than estimates for the prevalence of undernourishment.	但在多数地区，比如说发育迟缓儿童比例所表示的营养不良率却往往远高于估计的营养不良人数。
That is why nutrition-enhancing interventions in agriculture, schools, health care, water supplies, and elsewhere – especially targeting women and young children – are needed.	这说明为什么特别要针对妇女和儿童在农村、学校、医疗、供水和其他领域开展强化营养介入举措。
Efforts to ensure sustainable and inclusive economic growth are also vital.	确保持续及包容性经济增长的努力也至关重要。
With the protracted economic slowdown of the last half-decade spreading to even the most resilient areas of the developing world, achieving full employment is unlikely in most countries, at least in the foreseeable future.	随着过去五年的长期经济增长放缓蔓延到甚至是最具活力的发展中国家，至少在可以预见的将来，实现充分就业在多数国家是不太可能的。
But much can still be done to improve workers' employment prospects, and thus their ability to acquire the nourishment that they and their families need.	但改善工人就业前景、并由此提高他们保障家人营养的能力仍有很多工作要做。
In many cases, comprehensive reforms aimed at inducing sufficient agricultural investment and providing adequate social protection could facilitate major reductions in poverty and hunger.	很多情况下，以引导充足农业投资和提供充分社会保护为目的的全面改革可以显著减少贫困和饥饿。
This includes ensuring that people have reliable access to potable water and adequate sanitation.	其中包括确保民众获取可靠的饮用水和足够的卫生设施。
With the right design, the contribution of social-protection measures to reducing malnutrition would increase substantially.	如果设计得当，以减少营养不良为目的的社会保护措施的贡献将会显著提高。
For example, certain benefits could be conditional on prenatal and postnatal nutrition measures targeting mothers and pre-school children.	比方说，可以为母亲及学龄前儿童等特殊群体制定产前产后的营养补充措施。
Well-designed school meal programs have enabled children to overcome hunger – including the “hidden hunger" caused by micronutrient deficiencies.	精心设计的学校供餐方案已成功使儿童摆脱饥饿 — — 其中也包括因微量营养素缺乏引发的“隐性饥饿 ” 。
Related food-procurement policies have spurred the emergence of cooperatives of small family farmers practicing sustainable agriculture.	相关食品采购政策刺激成立了可持续耕作的家庭小型农场合作社。
Such measures – together with initiatives to enhance poor people's incomes – also help to spur rural development, stimulate markets, and promote job creation.	上述措施以及提高穷人收入计划同样有利于促进农村发展、刺激市场和创造就业机会。
A long-term political commitment to eradicating hunger and undernourishment – backed by decisive action – holds the key to improving health outcomes and supporting sustainable, inclusive economic growth worldwide.	在果断行动的支持下，消除饥饿和营养不良的长期政治承诺已成为改善健康状况、支持全球经济持续、包容增长的关键所在。
A good start has been made; now it is time to finish the job.	我们已经取得了良好的开端；现在应该再接再厉、实现目标。
	
Deconstructing the Euro	解构欧元
PARIS – In January, Chris Williamson, Chief Economist at the economics research firm Markit, called France “the new sick man of Europe.”	巴黎—1月，经济研究公司Markit首席经济学家克里斯·威廉森（Chris Williamson）将法国称为“欧洲新病夫 ” 。
With near-zero GDP growth, rising unemployment, and mounting public debt – not to mention counter-productive austerity policies – it is difficult to argue otherwise.	法国GDP增长几乎为零，失业不断增加，公债水平节节攀升 — — 更不用说反生产性的紧缩政策了 — — 这让你很难反驳他的观点。
Given France’s profound importance to Europe’s economic and political stability, this poses a major threat to the entire European project.	由于法国对欧洲经济和政治稳定具有很重要的作用，因此这对整个欧洲工程来说都是个重大威胁。
Recent developments confirm Williamson’s diagnosis.	最新发展态势验证了威廉森的论断。
French business activity sank to a seven-month low in December.	12月，法国商业活动降至七个月低点。
While tax revenues increased by €32 billion ($44 billion) last year, the government deficit fell by a mere €8 billion and public debt increased from 89% of GDP to more than 93%.	尽管去年税收收入增加了320亿欧元，但政府赤字只减少了80亿欧元，公债水平从占GDP的89%上升到93 % 。
Meanwhile, unemployment rose from 9.5% to 10.5%.	与此同时，失业率从9.5%增加到10.5 % 。
The obvious conclusion is that austerity is not the answer.	显而易见，紧缩不是答案。
Indeed, France must abandon its current policies, for its own – and the rest of Europe’s – sake.	事实上，法国必须放弃现有政策，这对它自己和对欧洲其他国家都好。
France’s problems, like those of the eurozone’s other troubled economies, stem from the fact that the euro’s exchange rate does not align with member countries’ economic positions.	和其他欧元区麻烦经济体一样，法国的问题来源于欧元汇率与成员国的经济状况不相符这一事实。
As a result, these countries’ virtual exchange rates vis-à-vis Germany are critically overvalued, inasmuch as wages in these countries have risen more quickly, and labor productivity more slowly, than in Germany.	结果是这些国家的实际对德国汇率被大大高估，因为这些国家工资增长更快而劳动生产率增长更慢。
Given that the implicit nominal exchange rates are fixed “forever” within the euro, these countries have accumulated major deficits relative to Germany.	由于隐含名义利率通过欧元被“永远”固定了，因此这些国家积累起相对德国的巨大赤字。
Likewise, the deficit countries’ exchange rates are overvalued relative to third countries like the United States and Japan, while Germany’s currency is undervalued, because the euro’s exchange rate is determined by the balance of payments of the eurozone as a whole, which Germany’s massive surplus distorts.	类似地，赤字国的汇率相对第三国（如美国和日本）也处于高估状态，而德国货币则处于低估状态，因为欧元汇率由欧元区总体收支平衡决定，而欧元区总体收支平衡因为德国的巨大盈余而存在扭曲。
In short, the euro exchange rate is too weak for equilibrium in Germany and too strong for equilibrium in France and the other less competitive eurozone economies.	简言之，欧元汇率对德国来说低于均衡水平，而对法国和其他竞争力较弱的欧元区经济体来说则高于均衡水平。
The eurozone’s weaker economies thus face a dilemma: either expand in line with productive potential, thereby incurring external deficits, or enforce austerity, eliminating external deficits by squeezing imports.	因此，欧元区疲软经济体面临一个两难：要么按生产潜力水平扩张，这意味着外部赤字；要么加强紧缩，通过挤出进口消除外部赤字。
Under pressure from Germany, they have so far pursued the latter option.	在德国的压力下，它们选择了后者。
The current “competitive austerity” trend is irrational, first and foremost, because, by undermining domestic demand, it directly controverts the currency union’s fundamental principle that a large domestic market should act as a buffer against external demand shocks.	当前的“竞争性紧缩”趋势是不理性的，首先，这破坏了内需，直接与货币联盟的基本原则 — — 庞大的国内市场应该成为抵御外部需求冲击的缓冲相悖。
This is causing everyone to suffer – even Germany.	这造成了所有国家的损失，包括德国。
Indeed, from 2007 to 2012, Germany’s exports to other eurozone countries declined by 9%, from €432 billion to €393 billion.	事实上，从2007年到2012年，德国对其他欧元区国家出口下降了9 % ， 从4,320亿欧元减少到3,930亿欧元。
But this is not the only threat that austerity poses to Germany’s hard-won prosperity.	但紧缩给德国好不容易赢得的繁荣所造成的威胁不止于此。
The euro has also caused Germany’s business cycle to diverge from those of the less competitive economies, while prohibiting customized monetary policies.	欧元还造成德国商业周期与竞争力较低经济体的脱节，并且让合适的货币政策无从实施。
And the common monetary policy that all are being forced to pursue is intensifying deflationary pressures in the weaker countries, while increasing inflationary pressures in Germany.	而被迫采取的共同货币政策加剧了疲软国的通缩压力，同时也增加了德国的通胀压力。
Furthermore, populations in the eurozone’s stagnant economies are increasingly demanding that Germany change its policies, increasing wages and implementing measures aimed at boosting consumption and discouraging savings.	此外，欧元区停滞经济体的人民日益需要德国改变其政策，提高工资并实施旨在提振消费、抑制储蓄的过时。
While responding to such demands would help to ease political tensions across the eurozone, they would face strong opposition within Germany.	尽管响应这一需要有助于缓解整个欧元区的政治紧张，但在德国国内会引起强烈反对。
Similarly, resolving the crises that will inevitably emerge from the current rigid exchange-rate system will ultimately require Germany to agree either to debt write-offs or to large-scale government-bond purchases by the European Central Bank, which would flood the eurozone with liquidity.	类似地，要解决当前的僵化汇率体系所必然会导致的危机，最终需要德国同意债务减记或欧洲央行大量买入政府债券（这会向欧元区注入大量流动性 ） 。
Either outcome would run contrary to Germany’s interests and preferences, making it as unfair an approach as austerity.	这两个结果都与德国的利益和偏好相悖，因此和紧缩一样有失公允。
What the eurozone needs is a solution that does not force any one country or group of countries to bear the brunt of the adjustment – and that means a controlled segmentation of the currency union.	欧元区需要这样的解决方案：它不会强迫任何一个或一些国家承受调整的主要成本。 这意味着对货币联盟做有控制的分割。
Contrary to popular belief, this could be done in a way that reinvigorates the European ideal, rather than reviving the parochial nationalism of the past.	与流行的见解不同，这可以通过一种刺激欧洲理想而不会让过去的狭隘民族主义死灰复燃的方式实现。
The key is to ensure that it arises from the European Union’s economic and political core.	关键在于它来自欧盟经济和政治核心。
Specifically, Germany, Europe’s greatest economic power, and France, the intellectual progenitor of European unification, should announce their simultaneous exit from the euro and re-adoption of the Deutsche Mark and the franc.	具体而言，欧洲最强大的经济体德国和欧洲统一思想的发源地法国应该同时宣布退出欧元区，从新采用德国马克和法郎。
This would trigger the immediate revaluation of the Deutsche Mark – and possibly of the franc – relative to the euro.	这会立刻导致德国马克（可能还包括法郎）对欧元的升值。
For their part, other EU member countries would have to decide whether to retain the euro in its truncated form or revert to their own national currencies, possibly pegging them to the revived Deutsche Mark or franc.	其他欧盟成员国则需要决定留在缩编后的欧元区还是重新采用其自身的国家货币，并可能盯住重新启用的德国马克或法郎。
Regardless of their decision, the price competitiveness of the eurozone’s weaker economies would improve considerably.	无论做出什么选择，欧元区疲软经济体的价格竞争力都会得到极大改善。
Of course, France and Germany would need to implement interim arrangements to safeguard their banking systems’ stability.	当然，法国和德国需要实施过渡性安排以保证银行系统的稳定。
Moreover, they would have to negotiate with the ECB and other European governments a plan for managing euro-denominated debts.	此外，它们还需要和欧洲央行和其他欧洲政府谈判，制定管理欧元计价债务的计划。
A period of monetary uncertainty, as European economies adjusted to the new environment, would be unavoidable.	在欧洲经济体适应性环境的过程中，一定时期的货币不确定性是不可避免的。
But that would be far better than the economic and political impasse in which the eurozone is now trapped.	但这也比欧元区目前所身处的经济和政治僵局强得多。
	
Latin America’s Ukraine	拉丁美洲的乌克兰
MEXICO CITY – By all indications, the international community has resigned itself to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s Crimean “land grab,” as US Vice-President Joe Biden has called it.	墨西哥城—从各种指标看，国际社会已经顺从于俄罗斯总统普京的“土地掠夺 ” （ 美国副总统拜登语 ） 。
Once Putin decided he wanted to assume the consequences of his acts, there was very little the United States, the European Union, or the United Nations could do.	一旦普京决定采取行动，美国、欧盟或联合国便束手无策。
Latin America, meanwhile, is experiencing the opposite problem.	与此同时，拉丁美洲正在经历相反的问题。
Though the region’s countries have the means to stop the growing political, economic, and human-rights catastrophe in Venezuela, they lack the will, while the rest of the world’s attention to Ukraine has removed any pressure on them to act.	尽管该地区各国有办法阻止委内瑞拉的政治、经济和人权状况继续恶化，但却缺乏意愿 ， ， 而世界其他地区的目光纷纷对准了乌克兰，这也让它们没有压力采取行动。
In Ukraine, the US and the EU seem to have decided on a sensible course of action – or, rather, on a realistic two-track response – that is unlikely to produce spectacular results, but is certainly preferable to passivity.	在乌克兰，美国和欧盟似乎决定采取明智动作 — — 或者说基于现实考虑的两手准备 — — 这一动作不可能产生令人瞩目的结果，但显然比不作为更好。
First, the sanctions imposed so far – visa cancellations, asset seizures or freezes, and the like – will not give Sevastopol back to Ukraine, but they will eventually bite, at least in certain Russian business sectors.	首先，目前所采取的制裁措施 — — 取消签证、资产没收或冻结等 — — 并不能让塞瓦斯托波尔回归乌克兰，但终究会起到作用，至少对俄罗斯的某些商业部门会起到作用。
Whether this unites the oligarchs, or divides them, and whether it forces them to take their money out of Russia, or bring it back home, cannot be predicted.	这些制裁会团结还是分裂寡头、会迫使他们将资金转出还是转回俄罗斯都无法预料。
But uncertainty is far better than knowing acquiescence.	但不确定性总比明知故犯的缄默好得多。
There are simply no alternatives right now, and applying the entire gamut of sanctions from the outset would leave the EU and the US without further options.	目前并无其他替代方案可用，而从外部全方位开启制裁也让欧盟和美国没有了进一步的选择。
Second, and much more important, a tacit anti-appeasement ultimatum has been issued to the Kremlin: additional expansion in Ukraine will lead to much stronger and more painful sanctions.	其次也是更重要的是，美国和欧盟向克里姆林宫发出了无声的反绥靖最后通牒：继续在乌克兰扩张将导致更强更痛苦的制裁。
This may or may not work, but the decisions and announcements at least have the merit of existing, thereby demonstrating the willingness of the G-7 and others to uphold principles and values to which Russia is, in theory, also committed.	这也许能奏效，也许不能，但这些决定和声明至少有其价值，从而说明了七国集团和其他国家愿意捍卫理论上俄罗斯也做出过承诺的原则和价值。
Clearly, the world’s democracies lack perfect options, given everyone’s eminently reasonable reluctance to resort to force.	显然，世界民主国家没有完美选择，因为每个国家都有充分的理由不寻求诉诸武力。
Given Ukraine’s location, history, and the potential for trouble, the international community’s greater attention to the crisis there than to the disaster unfolding in Venezuela is not surprising.	从乌克兰的区位、历史和造成麻烦的潜力看，国际社会更多地关注那里而不是正在委内瑞拉展开的灾难并不令人奇怪。
But it is not appropriate, either.	但对于后者的关注实在太少。
Recent events in Venezuela imply as many perils and unforeseen, perverse consequences as in Ukraine, and the international community, as well as most Latin American democracies, should be paying much more attention.	委内瑞拉最近发生的事件的风险性、不可预见性和严重性不亚于乌克兰，而国际社会（以及大部分拉丁美洲民主国家）应该给予更多关注。
For starters, there is energy security.	首先，这事关能源安全。
Venezuela has some of the world’s largest oil and gas reserves, and is a major exporter (though smaller than ten years ago).	委内瑞拉拥有世界最大石油和天然气储量之一，也是主要油气出口国（尽管出口规模较十年前有所下降 ） 。
And, for better or for worse, it is a key supplier to certain countries.	此外，不论好坏，它是一些国家的关键能源供给国。
Nearly all of the Caribbean, Central America, and some Gulf ports in the United States depend on Venezuelan low-sulfur crude oil for their power plants, refineries, and balance-of-payments positions.	几乎所有加勒比地区和中美洲以及部分美国墨西哥湾区港口依赖委内瑞拉低硫原油用于发电、精炼和实现收支平衡。
Cuba is the most dramatic case of dependence: Without subsidized Venezuelan petroleum and the enormous sums paid for the Castros’ doctors – some excellent, some fraudulent – the island’s economy would sink, causing a wave of Cubans to leave, as has occurred repeatedly over the past half-century.	古巴对委内瑞拉的依赖最大：如若没有受补贴的委内瑞拉汽油和给卡斯特罗医生（有些是名医，有些则是骗子）的巨额医疗费，古巴经济就将陷入萧条，促使一大批古巴人逃离，这在过去五十年中发生过多次。
This time, though, the consequences for Florida and Mexico could be graver than before.	但这一次，佛罗里达和墨西哥将受到比以往更大的影响。
But what happens in Venezuela matters for other reasons as well.	但委内瑞拉形势之所以重要，还有其他原因。
Targeted repression, imprisonment of opposition leaders, press censorship, shortages, inflation, and wanton violence – Caracas is one the world’s most dangerous cities – have created a situation that appears untenable in the medium term.	定向压迫、关押反对派领导人、新闻审查、短缺、通货膨胀和暴力肆虐 — — 加拉加斯已成为世界上最危险的城市之一 — — 从中期看，局面已难以为继。
The harsh economic and security measures that Venezuela needs to emerge from its current debacle cannot be implemented without some form of consensus, which requires an end to repression and polarization.	委内瑞拉需要严厉的经济和安全措施才能克服当前的障碍，这些措施只能在取得一定形式的共识的情况下才能实施，而取得共识又需要结束镇压和极端化。
Unfortunately, none of this seems likely if left exclusively in the hands of Venezuelans, who have failed repeatedly over the past 15 years to find solutions to their dilemmas.	不幸的是，如果完全由委内瑞拉人民自行处理，镇压和极端化就不可能结束，因为在过去15年中，委内瑞拉人从未找到过走出困境的办法。
Some have suggested a papal mediation; others have advocated intervention by a group of Latin American former presidents.	一些人建议采用宗教斡旋；也有人建议让由拉美国家前总统组成的小组进行干预。
The problem is that no Latin American government, with the exception of Panama, wants to dirty its hands.	问题在于，除了巴拿马以外，没有一个拉美国家政府愿意染指。
The three that count because of their size – Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico – are all frightened of the consequences: Brazil that its companies will lose contracts, Mexico that the Venezuelans will finance opposition to their energy reforms, and Argentina of losing an ally that knows too much.	三个有影响力的大国 — — 阿根廷、巴西和墨西哥 — — 都有各自担心的结果：巴西担心其公司会失去合同；墨西哥担心委内瑞拉会为其能源改革反对者提供融资；而阿根廷担心失去知道得太多的盟友。
The other two conceivably relevant countries – Colombia and Chile – refuse to get involved for different reasons.	另外两个据信关系也比较大的国家 — — 哥伦比亚和智利出于不同的原因拒绝牵涉其中。
Colombia needs President Nicolás Maduro’s cooperation to sustain negotiations with the FARC guerrillas; the new Chilean president, Michelle Bachelet, has always had a soft spot for Chavismo and its antics.	哥伦比亚需要委内瑞拉总统马杜罗的合作维持与FARC游击队的谈判；而智利新总统巴切莱特的软肋一直是查韦斯主义及其作态。
In the case of Crimea, the deaths of hundreds of demonstrators in Kyiv and the possible Russian takeover of eastern Ukraine has called into question principles such as non-intervention.	在克里米亚事件中，有数百人在基辅的示威中丧生，而俄罗斯有可能吞并东乌克兰，这使得不干预原则大有问题。
Not in Latin America: the number of students in Venezuela that are killed by government-sponsored paramilitary groups is still viewed as nobody’s business but the Venezuelans’, even though the country is a party to every regional instrument of international human-rights law.	而拉丁美洲并非如此：被征服支持的准军事集团杀害的数百名学生被认为只是委内瑞拉的内政，尽管该国加入了所有地区国际人权法机构。
And no outside mediation is feasible without a minimum of censure or criticism of Maduro’s extremism, even if the opposition takes its lumps, too, for some of its factions’ radical, occasionally subversive stances.	而任何外部调停都会遭到马杜罗极端主义的谴责和抨击，尽管反对派也在忍气吞声，因为反对派的一些派系持有激进的破坏性立场。
Paradoxically, whereas the Western powers are probably powerless in Ukraine, Latin America’s major players could exert great influence in Venezuela.	矛盾的是，西方强国或许在乌克兰问题上无能为力，但拉丁美洲大国可以向委内瑞拉施加很大的影响力。
Economic sanctions on Russia may eventually hurt, and the Kremlin may desist from further encroachment; but the Ukrainian crisis is largely impervious, in the short term, to outside involvement.	对俄罗斯的经济制裁或许最终会形成伤害，克里姆林宫可能停止进一步的侵略；但乌克兰危机在短期几乎不可能由外部干预。
In Venezuela, the danger is just as great for everybody, and addressing it is much cheaper and easier.	委内瑞拉的危险不下于乌克兰，而解决委内瑞拉问题比乌克兰成本低得多，也容易得多。
But doing so requires what most Latin American governments sorely lack: vision and courage.	但解决委内瑞拉问题需要大部分拉丁美洲国家非常欠缺的东西：远见和勇气。
	
Brazil’s Cautious Voters	巴西的谨慎选民
MEXICO CITY – Brazil has been in the global spotlight this year, and not always for the right reasons.	墨西哥城—今年以来，巴西一直是全球的焦点，不过原因并不总是光彩的。
Following the 2013 riots over the amount of money being spent on the 2014 soccer World Cup, protests continued up to, and even during, the tournament in June.	继2013年爆发针对2014年世界杯花费太多问题的骚乱后，示威活动一直持续到6月份，甚至世界杯举办期间都没有停息。
There were dire – though ultimately misplaced – predictions about chaotic conditions for participants, and then, of course, the catastrophic performance of the home team.	关于参赛者情况混乱的悲观预言时不时出现 — — 尽管最终被证明是杞人忧天，当然还有随后东道主噩梦般的表现。
Now, the costs of the soccer jamboree, coming on top of the country’s ongoing economic slowdown, are coming home to roost.	如今，足球狂欢的代价开始显露，令正处于经济减速中的巴西雪上加霜。
Several analysts have concluded that Brazil’s bubble has burst, and that the so-called “country of the future” will remain stuck in the present.	一些分析师认为巴西的泡沫已经破裂，所谓的“未来之国”将依然困顿于当下。
Economic uncertainty is also dramatically affecting Brazilian politics.	经济不确定性也在大大地影响着巴西政治。
And a once placid, even predictable, presidential election campaign has been thrown into disarray by the death of the Brazilian Socialist Party candidate, Eduardo Campos, in an airplane crash in August.	而曾经平稳甚至可预期的总统选战因为8月份社会党（Socialist Party）候选人爱德华多·坎波斯（Eduardo Campos）飞机失事遇难而变得扑朔迷离。
Campos’s running mate, Marina Silva, was then nominated to take his place.	随后，坎波斯的竞选搭档玛琳娜·席尔瓦（Marina Silva）被提名为候选人顶替坎波斯。
A presidential candidate four years ago who ran on a green, socially conservative, but strongly pro-democratic platform, Silva received nearly 20 million votes.	席尔瓦四年前就是总统候选人，经营着一个绿色、社会保守但坚定支持民主的平台。 她获得了近2,000万选票。
Her ties to Brazil’s huge evangelical churches, and her unwillingness to break with them on issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage, and drug policy, alienate many voters.	她与巴西庞大的福音教派的关系，以及她的不愿与他们在堕胎、同性婚姻和毒品政策等问题上决裂让她失去了许多选票。
Nonetheless, she has rapidly overtaken Aécio Neves, the Social Democratic Party (PSDB) candidate, as the main challenger to Dilma Rousseff, the incumbent President and Workers’ Party (PT) candidate.	尽管如此，他很快就超过了社会民主党（Social Democratic Party）候选人艾西奥·尼维斯（Aécio Neves ） ， 成为现任总统、工党（Worker’s Party）候选人罗塞夫的主要挑战者。
A run-off between the two women, following the October 5th first round, seems inevitable, as opinion polls give neither close to 50% of the vote.	在10月5日的首轮投票后，两位女性之间的斗争看起来已是不可避免，因为民调显示两人都不太可能获得50%的选票。
Though competent and tough, Rousseff faces voter fatigue after 12 years of PT rule, which many will remember, perhaps unfairly, for corruption scandals and the national team’s 7-1 drubbing by Germany in this year’s World Cup.	罗塞夫有能力也有韧劲，但她面临着工党执政十二年后的选民疲劳，许多人能记住的（尽管这不太公平）也许只有腐败丑闻以及巴西国家队在世界杯上被德国队以7比1血洗。
But it is the government’s dismal economic record over the past four years that is causing the biggest problems for Rousseff’s campaign.	但过去四年政府拙劣的经济记录才是影响罗塞夫选情的最大问题。
At the same time, Silva will not be able to win the run-off without an enthusiastic and persuasive endorsement from Neves and the PSDB.	与此同时，如果没有尼维斯和社会民主党的既热情又有说服力的支持，席尔瓦也无法胜出。
Fortunately for Silva, the PSDB is highly critical of the PT administration, especially the foreign policy of Rousseff’s predecessor, Luis Inácio Lula da Silva.	对席尔瓦而言，幸运的是社会民主党对工党政府持严厉批判态度，特别是对罗塞夫前任卢拉的外交政策。
PSDB-allied diplomats and former senior officials strongly have opposed the PT’s support for Latin America’s authoritarian regimes (particularly in Cuba and Venezuela), its futile insistence on a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, and its excessive embrace of non-aligned, anti-imperialist positions.	社会民主党阵营的外交官和前高级官员强烈反对工党对拉丁美洲极权政权（特别是古巴和委内瑞拉）的支持、对联合国安理会常任理事国席位徒劳无益的执着以及对不结盟反帝国主义立场的过分坚守。
A Silva victory would herald change in domestic and foreign policy alike.	席尔瓦的胜利将预示着国内和外交政策的变化。
But perhaps its most remarkable impact would be cultural.	但也许最令人瞩目的影响在于文化。
Though she would not be the first woman president (Rousseff broke the gender barrier) or the first from humble origins (Lula broke that taboo), she would be the first mulatto – darker-skinned than traditional Brazilian political leaders – to hold the office.	尽管她不是第一任女总统（罗塞夫打破了性别壁垒 ） ， 也不是第一任出身卑微的总统（卢拉打破了这一禁忌 ） ， 但她将是第一任混血总统 — — 比传统巴西政治领袖肤色更深。
Just as Lula’s 2002 election signified a sea of change in a highly class-conscious, socially stratified society, Silva’s election would shake up the racial order in a country – and indeed continent – where racism has not been eradicated.	正如2002年卢拉的当选预示着一个具有高度阶级意识、阶层分化明显的社会的大转变，席尔瓦的当选将颠覆这个至今仍未消灭种族主义的国家 — — 事实上是大陆 — — 的种族秩序。
Indeed, in a country that has been proud of its supposedly non-racist nature, there has been no Afro-Brazilian politician of significant stature for a century.	事实上，在这个以自称的不带种族色彩特征为豪的国家，一百年来从未有非洲裔巴西人政治家赢得崇高地位。
Despite the excitement aroused by her candidacy, however, Silva is unlikely to win.	尽管席尔瓦成为候选人引起了高涨的热情，但席尔瓦获胜可能性很小。
Since Latin America’s democratization in the 1980s, only two incumbents have lost – Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua (who was not really elected the first time) and Hipólito Mejía in the Dominican Republic.	自20世纪80年代拉丁美洲开始民主化以来，只有两位在任者输掉了选举 — — 尼加拉瓜的奥尔特加（他第一次也不是真正靠选举上台的）和多米尼加共和国的梅西亚。
More than a dozen incumbents have won re-election, more or less democratically.	十多位在任者都或多或少地通过民主方式赢得了连任。
The incumbent’s advantage in Latin America owes much to the feeble regulations restricting the government’s use of the state apparatus for campaign purposes.	拉丁美洲的在任者之所以获得如此优势，很大程度上是因为对政府动用国家机器为竞选造势的限制很小。
The scope for abuse of power, public money, the media, and most state institutions available to sitting presidents makes it almost impossible to defeat them.	在任总统可以大规模滥用权力、公共资金、媒体和大部分国家机构，这使得他们几乎不可战胜。
Ultimately, Brazilians may just be too unsure about handing power to Silva, who has become a media phenomenon but remains an unknown quantity.	最终，巴西人或许无法下定决心将权力交给席尔瓦 — — 尽管她已经成为媒体的宠儿，但资质仍有待观察。
Rousseff will probably be re-elected, not so much on the strength of her record as because voters fear the unfamiliar.	罗塞夫也许能够连任 — — 与其说因为她的执政记录，不如说因为选民害怕不熟悉的对象。
That would be a pity.	这将是一件憾事。
After all, most new political challengers appear unprepared for the top job until they are in power.	毕竟，大部分新政治挑战者在赢得权力之前都没有做好问鼎最高宝座的准备。
But Brazilians may feel that they have already broken enough political barriers and taboos in recent years, and that Silva would represent one too many.	但巴西人也许觉得近几年中他们已经打破了足够多的政治禁忌，少一个席尔瓦无关紧要。
	
Mexico’s Second Revolution	墨西哥的二次革命
MEXICO CITY – Mexico, a stagnant and violence-plagued country in recent years, finally began to overcome its malaise in 2013, thanks to an activist president and a coalition of political parties determined to move the country forward.	墨西哥城 — — 多亏身为政党活动家的总统和决心推动国家进步的政党，近年来经济停滞、饱受暴力之困的国家​​墨西哥终于开始在2013年走出低迷境况。
But, alongside substantive changes, there is considerable uncertainty and hyperbole.	但在出现实质性变化的同时也不乏不确定和夸张。
It could hardly be otherwise.	几乎肯定会出现这种现象。
The situation resembles that of 20 years ago – almost to the day.	现在的情况与20年前何其相似 — — 几乎就是20年前的同一天。
When the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) among Mexico, Canada, and the United States entered into force on January 1, 1994, it seemed that Mexico was poised for a true takeoff.	1994年1月1日墨西哥、加拿大和美国达成北美自由贸易协定（NAFTA）时，墨西哥似乎正面临着真正的腾飞。
But a series of events – the Zapatista uprising in Chiapas, the assassinations of a presidential candidate and the incoming president’s chief aide, and the collapse of the currency – shook Mexico that year, underscoring the depth of the challenges it faced.	但之后发生的一系列事件 — — 恰帕斯州爆发萨帕塔起义、总统候选人及其即将上任的首席助理被暗杀再加之货币崩溃 — — 那一年的系列事件沉重打击了墨西哥，并凸显出这个国家所面临的挑战。
NAFTA brought with it a spectacular increase in Mexican exports, as well as a dramatic shift in their composition.	北美自由贸易协定不仅令墨西哥出口显著增加，还使出口构成发生了戏剧性的改变。
But it proved to be a great disappointment in terms of foreign investment inflows and economic growth, which has averaged 2.6% per year over the last two decades – slower than Peru, Chile, Colombia, Brazil, and Uruguay.	但在外资流入及经济增长领域该协定的效果却令人失望。 20年来墨西哥2.6%的年均增长率排在秘鲁、智利、哥伦比亚、巴西和乌拉圭之后。
As a result, Mexico’s income gap with the US and Canada has barely narrowed.	结果是墨西哥与美国加拿大的收入差距几乎没有缩小。
Thus, President Enrique Peña Nieto’s task since taking office one year ago has been to ensure that the promise of major change in Mexico finally translates into sustained economic growth, improved living standards, and faster convergence with the US and Canada.	因此，总统恩里克·佩尼亚·涅托上任一年来的任务是确保墨西哥发生重大变革的承诺最终带来经济持续增长、人民生活水平提高以及加速追赶美国和加拿大。
While both the foreign and local press refer generally to “reforms,” or lump together education, labor, financial, fiscal, energy, telecommunications, and political reforms, there are significant differences among them.	虽然国外和当地媒体都爱谈论“改革 ” ， 也称为教育、劳动、金融、财政、能源、电信和政治等领域的综合改革，但他们之间却有着非常显著的差别。
Some consider all of the changes that have taken place in Mexico this year to be equally important.	有人认为今年墨西哥方方面面的改革同等重要。
Others have mused that Peña Nieto’s administration sometimes seems intent on announcing reforms, regardless of their content, the time necessary to implement them, or their actual impact on Mexican society.	还有人认为佩尼亚·涅托内阁有时似乎着意于宣布改革，但却忽略了改革内容、推进时间或改革对墨西哥社会的实际影响。
In fact, a clear distinction can be drawn between two subsets of legislative achievements: those that, while not meaningless, are incomplete, superficial, or essentially maintain the status quo, and those that will change Mexico (if all goes well).	事实上，立法成就可以明确划分为两个部分：一部分虽然并非毫无意义，但改革内容片面、肤浅、或者说从本质上维持现状，而如果一切进展顺利，另一部分则能让墨西哥的现状发生变化。
The changes in how teachers are evaluated and their labor rights (wrongly described as an education reform), together with changes to tax and telecommunications legislation, belong to the first category; energy and political reforms belong to the second.	教师评估方式及其劳工权利（错误地被描述为教育改革）改革连同税收和电信法规改革均属于第一大类；而能源和政治改革则属于后者。
Energy reform opens up electricity generation and oil exploration, extraction, and refining to private foreign or domestic investment through licenses, concessions, production sharing, or profit sharing.	能源改革借助许可、特许、产品分成或利润共享等方式向国外私营及国内投资公司开放发电、石油勘探、开采和冶炼业务。
The oil workers’ union has been banished from the board of directors of Pemex, the national oil company, and new contracts for shale oil and gas, together with deep-water prospecting and drilling, will be signed with a government agency, not with Pemex.	石油工人工会已被逐出墨西哥石油公司（Pemex）董事会，很快就将与政府机构、而非墨西哥石油公司签订新的页岩油气及深海勘察钻探合同。
Once the myriad legal and political obstacles are cleared, Mexico will be able to increase oil and gas production, drive down the price of electricity, and stimulate growth in an otherwise lethargic economy. One hopes that 12 years of obstruction by Peña Nieto’s Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) will not mean that these reforms are too little, too late.	一旦多如牛毛的法律及政治障碍得以清除，墨西哥就能增加石油天然气产量、压低电价并刺激死气沉沉的经济���人们希望佩尼亚·涅托的革命制度党（PRI）12年来的阻挠不会使上述改革来得太少太迟。
The second crucial reform is political.	第二次关键改革是在政治领域。
For the first time since the early 1920’s, Mexican legislators and mayors will be allowed to seek reelection to consecutive terms.	20世纪20年代以来，墨西哥议员和市长将首次被允许寻求竞选连任。
While no panacea, reelection is one of the most important instruments of accountability in a democracy, and Mexico has been deprived of it for nearly a century.	虽然没有包治百病的灵丹妙药，但连任是民主国家责任制的重要工具，而连任在墨西哥已经近一个世纪不被允许。
The same is true of ballot initiatives, referenda, and independent candidacies, all of which were non-existent until the recent reform.	类似的还有公民投票、全民公决和独立候选人制度，直到最近这次改革之前根本不存在这些民主工具。
For the first time since Mexico left behind 70 years of authoritarian rule, the country has a political and electoral framework that resembles those found in all modern democracies.	在长达70年的专制统治后，民主国家所具备的政治和选举架构首次在墨西哥建立。
Both reforms are incomplete and may not be sufficient to jump-start the economy and mobilize a singularly passive civil society.	这两次改革都还没有完成，或许不足以启动经济发展和动员消极被动的民间团体。
Because Pemex, unlike the Brazilian and Colombian state-owned oil companies, will not be listed on the New York or Mexico City stock exchanges, internal reform will be postponed or half-baked.	墨西哥石油公司不像巴西和哥伦比亚的国有石油公司那样可以在纽约或墨西哥城证券交易所上市，因此可能导致其内部改革有些草率和延迟。
Moreover, it will be years before any oil actually begins to flow from the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico, and how much shale oil and gas actually exists in northeastern Mexico is unknown.	此外，墨西哥湾深海水域开始实际产油可能还需要等几年，而且墨西哥东北部页岩油气的蕴藏量也依然是未知数。
Nor is it certain that foreign investment (or tourism) will increase, given the country’s current levels of violence, crime, and human-rights violations.	鉴于墨西哥目前的暴力、犯罪和侵犯人权行为，外资（或旅游）的增加也具有不确定性。
Likewise, restrictions and ambiguities continue to plague the institutional arrangements sought by the framers of the country’s political and electoral reforms.	同样，限制和歧义继续困扰着该国政治及选举改革策划者的制度安排。
Reelection is permitted only for candidates nominated by the same party for which they originally ran, and the enabling legislation for independent candidates, ballot initiatives, and referenda remains unclear.	只有代表最初提名政党竞选的候选人才被允许竞选连任，独立候选人、公民投票和全民公决的授权法律仍不甚明确。
Most important, the government appears to be backtracking on a commitment to allow a binding referendum on the opening of the oil sector and other “transcendent” issues.	最重要的是，政府似乎背弃了一项允许就石油部门开放及其他“超验”问题进行决定性公投的承诺。
Its reluctance is understandable, because voters are evenly divided on the issue, and no one will invest a cent in Mexican oil or gas if the recently approved constitutional amendment on Pemex can be overturned in 2015, as the opposition claims will happen.	政府勉为其难的态度可以理解，因为选民在这个问题上的态度几乎平分秋色，如果不久前批准的墨西哥石油公司宪法修正案真能如反对派所言在2015年被推翻，那么没有人愿意对墨西哥的石油天然气进行一分钱的投资。
But curtailing democracy in order to modernize the energy sector is not a good idea.	但为实现能源现代化而遏制民主也不是一个好主意。
Finally, skepticism persists with regard to the Mexican economy’s capacity to achieve sustainable 4-5% annual economic growth – the bare minimum needed to ensure long-term prosperity.	最后，很多人仍然怀疑墨西哥经济能否持续实现4-5%的年度经济增长 — — 这样的增长速度是确保长期繁荣所必须的。
Deficient education, infrastructure, security, and courts, together with endemic corruption and scant entrepreneurial dynamism, militate against excessive optimism.	妨碍过度乐观的包括教育、基础设施、安全及法律资源短缺，再加上地方腐败和缺乏创业活力。
NAFTA 20 years ago, and Peña Nieto’s reforms now, are necessary but insufficient conditions for progress.	20年前的北美自由贸易协定和今天的佩尼亚·涅托改革都是进步的必要而非充分条件。
More is needed, and what is needed is not necessarily attainable.	进步需要付出更多努力，而需要的东西并不一定能成为现实。
	
The Middle East and the Return of History	中东和历史的回归
BERLIN – Ever since Francis Fukuyama argued, more than two decades ago, that the world had reached the end of history, history has made the world hold its breath.	柏林—自二十年前弗朗西斯·福山（Francis Fukuyama）提出世界已达到历史的终结以来，历史便让世界扼住了它的呼吸。
China’s rise, the Balkan wars, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the global financial crisis of 2008, the “Arab Spring,” and the Syrian civil war all belie Fukuyama’s vision of the inevitable triumph of liberal democracy.	中国崛起、巴尔干战争、2011年9月11日恐怖袭击、阿富汗和伊拉克战争、2008年全球金融危机 、 “ 阿拉伯之春”以及叙利亚内战都与福山所看到的自由民主的胜利不可阻挡的趋势背道而驰。
In fact, history could be said to have come full circle in the space of a quarter-century, from the fall of communism in Europe in 1989 to renewed confrontation between Russia and the West.	事实上，从1989年欧洲共产主义失败到俄罗斯和西方冲突重燃，可以说历史在四分之一个世纪的时间里完成了一个完整的循环。
But it is in the Middle East that history is at work on a daily basis and with the most dramatic consequences.	但在中东，历史每一天都在发挥作用，并产生最具戏剧性的结果。
The old Middle East, formed out of the remains of the Ottoman Empire after World War I, is clearly falling apart, owing, in no small part, to America’s actions in this conflict-prone region.	由一战后的奥斯曼帝国诸部组成的旧中东显然已经分崩离析，其中美国在这个冲突频发地区的行为要占很大原因。
The United States’ original sin was its military invasion of Iraq in 2003 under President George W. Bush.	美国的原罪是小布什总统在2003年发动的入侵伊拉克的战争。
The “neoconservatives” in power at the time were oblivious to the need to fill the power vacuum both in Iraq and the region following the removal of Saddam Hussein.	当时掌权的“新保守派”忘却了填补伊拉克和中东地区在推翻萨达姆·侯赛因后留下的权力真空的需要。
President Barack Obama’s hasty, premature military withdrawal constituted a second US failure.	奥巴马总统的撤军也操之过急，构成了美国的第二个失败。
America’s withdrawal, nearly coinciding with the outbreak of the Arab Spring and the eruption of the Syrian civil war, and its persistent passivity as the regional force for order, now threatens to lead to the disintegration of Iraq, owing to the rapid advance of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, including its capture of the country’s second-largest city, Mosul.	美国的撤军与阿拉伯之春和叙利亚内战的爆发几乎同时，而其作为地区秩序维持力量所表现出来的持续的消极性如今有可能导致伊拉克分裂 — — 伊拉克和叙利亚伊斯兰国（ISIS）迅速崛起，并且已经打下了伊拉克第二大城市摩苏尔。
Indeed, with ISIS in control of most of the area northwest of Baghdad, the border between Iraq and Syria has essentially ceased to exist.	事实上，ISIS已经控制了巴格达西北的大部分地区，伊拉克和叙利亚的边境实际上已不复存在。
Many of their neighbors’ borders may also be redrawn by force.	两国的邻国边界也有可能被武力重新勾画。
An already massive humanitarian disaster seems certain to become worse.	已然爆发的大规模人道主义灾难几乎肯定会继续恶化。
Should ISIS succeed in establishing a permanent state-like entity in parts of Iraq and Syria, the disintegration of the region would accelerate, the US would lose its “global war on terror,” and world peace would be seriously threatened.	如果ISIS成功地在伊拉克和叙利亚诸部建立永久的类似国家的实体，那么中东地区分崩离析之势将会加速，美国将输掉“全球反恐战争 ” ， 世界和平也将受到严重威胁。
But even without an ISIS terror state, the situation remains extremely unstable, because the Syrian civil war is proving to be highly contagious.	但即使没有ISIS恐怖主义国家，局面也非常不稳，因为叙利亚内战极有可能会蔓延开去。
In fact, “civil war” is a misnomer, because events there have long entailed a struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran for regional predominance, powered by the age-old conflict between Islam’s Sunni majority and Shia minority.	事实上，���叙利亚冲突是“内战”有些不妥，因为叙利亚局势长期以来一直包含着沙特阿拉伯与伊朗的地区主宰权斗争，而其背后则是历史悠久的伊斯兰教逊尼派多数和什叶派少数之间的冲突。
The Kurds form another unstable component of the Ottoman legacy.	库尔德人构成了奥斯曼帝国昔日领土上的另一个不稳定因素。
Divided among several Middle Eastern countries – Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Turkey – the Kurds have been fighting for their own state for decades.	库尔德人散布于多个中东国家 — — 伊朗、伊拉克、叙利亚和土耳其 — — 几十年来一直在为建立自己的国家而斗争。
Nonetheless, they have shown great restraint in northern Iraq since Saddam’s fall, contenting themselves with building up their autonomous province both economically and politically – to the point that it is independent in all but name, with a strong and experienced army in the Peshmerga militia.	尽管如此，自萨达姆倒台以来，他们在伊拉克北部表现出极大的克制，满足于建立经济和政治上的自治省 — — 即获得除表面名义之外的所有独立实质，包括一支强大且经验丰富的自由斗士（Peshmerga）军。
The advance of ISIS and its capture of Mosul have now resolved, in one fell swoop, all territorial disputes between the central government and the Kurdish regional government in favor of the latter, particularly regarding the city of Kirkuk.	如今，ISIS的崛起以及拿下摩苏尔以秋风扫落叶之势解决了伊拉克中央政府与库尔德地区政府之间的领土纠纷，库尔德人大获全胜，特别是在基尔库克（Kirkuk ） 。
Following the Iraqi army’s retreat, the Peshmerga promptly took over the city, giving the Kurdish north ample oil and gas reserves.	在伊拉克军队撤出后，自由斗士军马上占领了该市，给北部库尔德人地区带来充足的石油和天然气储备。
Moreover, neighboring Iran and Turkey, as well as the US, will urgently need the Peshmerga’s support against ISIS.	此外，相邻的伊朗和土耳其以及美国都迫切需要自由斗士军支持对抗ISIS。
Thus, an unexpected window of opportunity has opened for the Kurds to achieve full independence, though their dependence on good relations with both Turkey and Iran for access to global markets will moderate their political ambitions.	因此，库尔德人获得了一个意料之外的获得完全独立的机会窗口，尽管他们必须与土耳其和伊朗搞好关系才能进入全球市场的局面制约了他们的政治雄心。
Moreover, with its invasion of Iraq, the US opened the door to regional hegemony for Iran and initiated a dramatic shift in its own regional alliances, the long-term effects of which – including the current nuclear negotiations with the Iranian government – are now becoming apparent.	此外，在入侵伊拉克的过程中，美国开启伊朗的地区霸权之门，也给其地区盟友带来了剧变，长期影响 — — 包括目前与伊朗政府进行的核谈判 — — 正在日益显现。
Both sides are fighting the same jihadists, who are supported by America’s supposed allies, the Sunni-ruled Gulf states.	双方在打同一批圣战主义者，而后者得到了美国的盟友 — — 海湾逊尼派国家的支持。
Though the US and Iran remain opposed to official cooperation, the wheels have been set in motion, with direct bilateral talks becoming routine.	尽管美国和伊朗仍然反对正式合作，但车轮已经在转动，直接双边谈判已成为常态。
One key question for the future is whether Jordan, which plays a key function in the region’s equilibrium, will survive the geopolitical shifts unscathed.	关于未来的一个关键问题是在地区均衡中扮演关键角色的约旦是否能在地缘政治变化中安然无恙。
If it does not, the entire balance of power in the traditional Middle East conflict between Israel and the Palestinians could collapse.	如果答案是否定的，那么整个以色列-巴勒斯坦传统中东冲突实力平衡将崩溃。
The consequences would most likely be far-reaching, if difficult to assess in advance.	后果的影响难以估量，但很有可能极为深远。
For Europe, developments in the Middle East pose two major risks: returning jihadi fighters who threaten to bring the terror with them, and a spillover of their extremist ideas to parts of the Balkans.	对欧洲来说，中东发展趋势带来了两大风险：圣战主义者带着恐怖主义卷土重来；以及他们的极端思想蔓延到巴尔干地区。
In the interest of their own security, the European Union and its member states will be compelled to pay much closer attention to southeastern Europe than they have until now.	处于自身安全利益，欧盟及其成员国将被迫比如今更紧密地关注东南欧。
	
Putin’s Reality Check for Europe	普京的欧洲现实检验
BERLIN – For far too long, the West has harbored illusions about Vladimir Putin’s Russia – illusions that have now been shattered on the Crimean peninsula.	柏林—长久以来，西方一直对普京的俄罗斯抱有幻想 — — 如今，这一幻想在克里米亚半岛被一举击碎。
The West could (and should) have known better: Ever since his first term in office as Russian president, Putin’s strategic objective has been to rebuild Russia’s status as a global power.	西方本可以（也应该）更好地知道，自第一次任俄罗斯总统以来，普京的战略目标就一直是重塑俄罗斯全球霸权的地位。
To this end, Putin used Russia’s energy exports to recover gradually the territories lost when the Soviet Union collapsed a generation ago.	在这方面，普京用俄罗斯的能源出口逐渐恢复了二十五年前苏联解体造成的领土损失。
Ukraine has been at the heart of this strategy, because, without it, the aim of a revived Russia is unachievable.	乌克兰是这一战略的核心，因为没有乌克兰，复苏的俄罗斯就无法实现其目标。
So Crimea was just the first target; the next will be eastern Ukraine and persistent destabilization of the country as a whole.	因此克里米亚只是第一个目标；下一个将是乌克兰东部以及乌克兰作为一个整体国家的永久动荡。
Before our eyes, the post-Soviet international system in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia is being overthrown.	在我们眼里，东欧、高加索和中亚的后苏联时代国际体系正在被推翻。
Nineteenth-century concepts of international order, based on zero-sum balance-of-power considerations and spheres of interest, are threatening to supersede modern norms of national self-determination, the inviolability of borders, the rule of law, and the fundamental principles of democracy.	十九世纪的国际秩序概念 — — 以零和实力平衡考虑和利益圈为基础 — — 有可能正在取代国家自决权的现代范式、国界的不可侵犯性、法治精神以及民主的基本原则。
As a result, this upheaval will have a massive impact on Europe and its relations with Russia, for it will determine whether Europeans live by twenty-first-century rules.	结果，乌克兰剧变将对欧洲及其对俄关系造成巨大影响，因为它将决定欧洲是否能生活在二十一世纪的规则下。
Those who believe that the West can adapt to Russian behavior, as Putin’s Western apologists suggest, risk contributing to further strategic escalation, because a soft approach will merely embolden the Kremlin.	有人（如普京的西方辩护者）认为西方可以适应俄罗斯的行为，这有可能导致进一步的战略升级，因为软方针只能让克里姆林宫变本加厉。
Indeed, whether or not its leaders acknowledge it, the European Union is now in direct conflict with Russia over its enlargement policy since the end of the Cold War.	事实上，不管其领导人是否承认，如今欧盟自冷战结束以来的扩大政策已经与俄罗斯形成了直接冲突。
That is because Russia’s re-emergence as a global power requires not just the reintegration of lost Soviet territories, but also direct access to Europe and a dominant role there, especially in Eastern Europe.	正因如此，俄罗斯重新崛起为全球霸权不但需要重获失去的苏联领土，还需要进军欧洲并在欧洲起到主导作用，特别是在东欧。
So a fundamental strategic struggle is now a given.	因此，基本战略斗争现在已经开始了。
From a Western perspective, willful confrontation makes little sense, because the EU and Russia are and will continue to be neighbors.	从西方角度看，故意对抗是毫无意义的，因为欧盟和俄罗斯现在是、将来也是邻居。
Looking ahead, Russia will need the EU even more than vice versa, because in its Far East and in Central Asia, China is emerging as a rival of entirely different dimensions.	放眼未来，俄罗斯需要欧盟更甚于欧盟需要俄罗斯，因为在远东和中亚，中国正在崛起为一个各方面完全不同的对手。
Moreover, Russia’s rapid demographic decline and enormous modernization deficit imply the need for a joint future with Europe.	此外，俄罗斯人口的快速下降以及巨大的现代化赤字意味着它的未来与欧洲息息相关。
But seizing this opportunity is possible only on the basis of the rule of law, not of force, and must be guided by the principles of democracy and national self-determination, not great-power politics.	但要抓住这一机会必须建立在法治精神而不是武力的基础上，并且必须以民主原则和国家自决权而不是实力政治为指导。
Instead, Putin has now triggered a lasting crisis.	相反，普京已经触发了持续危机。
The West’s response will be a new containment policy, mainly taking the form of economic and diplomatic measures.	西方的反应是新的遏制政策，即采取经济和外交手段。
Europe will reduce its energy dependence on Russia, review its strategic alignment and priorities, and scale back investment and bilateral cooperation.	欧洲将降低其对俄罗斯的能源依赖，重新审视其战略一致性和低昂务之急，并收回投资和双边合作。
In the short term, Putin seems to have greater leverage, but the weakness of his position will soon become apparent.	在短期，似乎是普京尽占上风，但他的处境的弱点很快就会暴露。
Russia is completely dependent, economically and politically, on its commodity and energy exports, which go primarily to Europe.	俄罗斯在经济上和政治上完全依赖于其大宗商品和能源出口，而主要出口地就是欧洲。
Lower European demand and an oil price that no longer suffices to sustain Russia’s budget stand to hobble the Kremlin very quickly.	欧洲需求的减少和无法充分支持俄罗斯预算的油价必将很快让克里姆林宫深感掣肘。
Indeed, there is reason to believe that Putin may have overplayed his hand.	事实上，有理由认为普京的做法已经过犹不及。
The collapse of the Soviet Union at the beginning of the 1990’s was caused not by the West, but by a wave of secession, as nationalities and minorities, seeing the party-state weakened, seized the opportunity to break free.	20世纪90年代初的苏联解体不是西方造成的，而是由一系列脱离造成的，而脱离是因为民主主义者和少数族裔看到了党国已经变弱，于是抓住机会脱离苏联。
Today’s Russia has neither the economic nor the political strength to regain and integrate the lost Soviet territories, and any attempt by Putin to press on with his plan would impoverish its people and lead to further disintegration – a bleak prospect.	如今，俄罗斯在经济上和政治上都没有强到可以重新获得并统一失去的苏联领土的程度，而普京计划的实施将让俄罗斯人民陷入贫穷，造成进一步的离心离德 — — 前景黯淡。
Europeans have reason to be worried, and they now have to face the fact that the EU is not just a common market – a mere economic community – but a global player, a cohesive political unit with shared values and common security interests.	欧洲有理由担忧，并且现在不得不面对一个现实，即欧盟不仅仅是一个共同市场，一个经济共同体，它也是一个全球行动者，一个团结的、拥有共同价值和安全利益的政治单元。
Europe’s strategic and normative interests have thus re-emerged with a vengeance; in fact, Putin has managed, almost singlehandedly, to invigorate NATO with a new sense of purpose.	欧洲的战略和规范利益因此意外地重新浮现；事实上，普京几乎凭借一己之力让北约有了新的使命感。
The EU will have to understand that it is not acting in a vacuum in its eastern and southern neighborhood, and that, for the sake of its own security interests, the conflicting interests of other powers there cannot simply be ignored or, worse, accepted.	欧盟需要认识到它不是在东部和南部周边真空中行动，并且出于其自身安全利益考虑，那里的其他大国的冲突利益绝不容忽视（甚至不容接受 ） 。
The EU’s enlargement policy is not merely some expensive, expendable annoyance; it is a vital component of the EU’s security and outward projection of power.	欧盟的扩张政策并不只是一些昂贵、消耗性质的聒噪；而是欧盟安全和外向实力工程的关键要素。
Safety comes with a price tag.	安全是有代价的。
Perhaps now there will be a reassessment in the United Kingdom of the costs of an EU exit.	或许如今英国将重新评估退出欧盟的代价。
And maybe there will be a realization on the Continent that European unification must move forward more quickly, because the world – and Europe’s neighborhood in particular – has turned out to be not as peaceful as many, above all the Germans, perceived it to be.	也许欧洲大陆将意识到欧洲统一必须更快地向前迈进，因为世界 — — 特别是欧洲周边 — — 并不像许多人（特别是德国人）认为的那样安全。
The EU peace project – the original impetus for European integration – may have worked too well; after more than six decades of success, it had come to be considered hopelessly outdated.	欧洲安全工程 — — 欧洲一体化的原始动力 — — 可能运转得太好了；在六十多年的成功后，它也许已经彻底过时了。
Putin has provided a reality check.	普京提供了一次现实检验。
The question of peace in Europe has returned, and it must be answered by a strong and united EU.	欧洲的和平问题回来了，并且必须由一个强大而统一的欧盟来面对。
	
The Middle East in the Arab Winter	阿拉伯冬天里中东
BERLIN – Travel broadens the mind, goes the old saying.	柏林 — — 古语说：旅行可以开阔思路。
This is especially true for the Middle East.	这句话尤其适用于中东。
But travel there nowadays can be extremely disorienting; indeed, developments that were impossible to contemplate just a few months ago are becoming reality.	但今时今日去那里旅行让人异常迷惑；事实上，短短几个月前还无法想象的事态目前正在发生。
The youth revolt that began in Tunis and Cairo in 2010-2011 has come to an end (at least for the time being), though the region has been changed fundamentally by it.	2010-2011年始于突尼斯和开罗的青年起义已经结束（至少目前暂时结束 ） ， 但这次起义已经彻底改变了中东地区的格局。
The victory of counter-revolution and power politics, as in Egypt, has only seemed to restore the old order; the current regime’s political foundations are simply too brittle.	埃及反革命及强权政治获胜似乎不过是恢复了旧有的秩序；现政权的政治基础实在过于薄弱。
Equally noticeable has been the permanent shift in the region’s political-strategic axis.	该地区政治战略轴心的永久性改变同样引人注目。
Iran, with its nuclear and hegemonic ambitions, is the current center, while the old center – the Israeli-Palestinian conflict – has been marginalized, giving rise to entirely new alliances of interests.	拥有核野心及霸权抱负的伊朗成为当前的核心，而以巴冲突代表的原有核心已经边缘化，缔造出全新的利益联盟。
Saudi Arabia and Israel (which have no formal diplomatic relations) are united against Iran – and against the possibility of a US-Iranian détente.	（并未建立正式外交关系的）沙特和以色列共同反对伊朗 — — 反对美伊关系出现缓和的可能性。
Ideologically, the central conflict between Iran and its neighbors is based on the sectarian conflict between Sunni and Shia Islam.	意识形态上，逊尼和什叶派穆斯林的教派冲突是伊朗及其邻国核心冲突的起源。
The devastating Syrian civil war is already being fought along these lines; given signs of a military and political stalemate, those lines could become the basis of a permanent division of the country, as in Bosnia.	由此引发了毁灭性的叙利亚内战；由于已经显露出军事政治僵局的迹象，上述问题可能像在波斯尼亚那样造成国家的永久性分裂。
If this happens, Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan would not be left unaffected.	如果这种情况真的出现，伊拉克、黎巴嫩和约旦肯定无法置身事外。
The old Anglo-French Middle East mapped out by the Sykes-Picot Agreement in May 1916 would be gone for good.	1916年5月赛克斯-皮科协定描绘的英法划界中东的原有格局将一去不复返。
Moreover, the Kurdish issue has reappeared – and could indirectly influence and re-radicalize the Palestinian question.	另外库尔德问题又再次出现 — — 这可能间接影响到巴勒斯坦问题，导致局面重新激化。
Unfortunately, there is not much evidence that an Israeli-Palestinian settlement based on a two-state solution will preempt this development.	不幸的是，没有多少证据表明基于双边谈判的以巴方案能够防止这样的情况出现。
Then there is the question of the long-term consequences of Al Qaeda’s rebirth in the form of Sunni jihadism in Syria, Yemen, and North and East Africa.	再有就是基地组织以逊尼圣战主义的名义在叙利亚、也门、北非和东非地区重生，以及由此带来的长期后果。
The Gulf monarchies are trying to ride this tiger militarily against Iran.	海湾君主国在与伊朗的军事对抗中已经势成骑虎。
But what will happen when they one day find themselves in the role of the sorcerer’s apprentice?	如果有一天他们发觉自己扮演了魔法师学徒的角色将会怎样？
Will this fanatical wind blow back to the Arab peninsula?	这股狂热之风是否将吹回阿拉伯半岛？
And could these societies’ domestic institutions withstand such an attack?	上述国家的国内机构能否经得起这样的破坏？
Throughout the Middle East, most of the political elite remain trapped within a worldview defined by power politics and nineteenth-century notions of sovereignty.	中东地区多数政治精英今天仍受到强权政治和十九世纪主权观念造就的世界观的束缚。
Their strategic watchwords are national rivalry, balance, and hegemony – concepts that offer no solution for the future of the region’s nations and states.	他们的战略口号是国家竞争、平衡和霸权 — — 这些概念无法造就地区民族和国家未来的前途。
Intraregional economic cooperation, which is essential to achieving sustained growth and social development, much less a regional security framework to ensure peace and stability, remains an alien idea.	迄今为止他们依然对实现持续增长和社会发展、以及确保和平稳定的地区安全架构所必不可少的区域经济合作概念非常生疏。
In essence, the Middle East is experiencing a crisis of modernization.	中东本质上正在经历一场现代化危机。
The rebellious youth who led popular demands for change are lying low (or have been rounded up); but, given the intellectual paralysis of the region’s rulers (and large parts of the opposition), an even more violent eruption can be expected.	引领民众改革要求的叛逆的年轻人正在暂避风头（或者遭到围捕 ） ； 但因为地区统治者（和多数反对派）的精神瘫痪，爆发更猛烈的抗议行动是早晚的事。
As in the past, Egypt will play a guiding role for the entire region (whether it wants to or not).	（无论本身情愿与否 ， ） 埃及将一如既往地引领整个地区。
The region’s modernization crisis is being compounded by the partial withdrawal of an exhausted force for order, the United States.	筋疲力尽的美国维和部队部分撤离加剧了中东地区的现代化危机。
This is fueling tremendous anxiety in the region and has contributed to the overthrow of existing alliances and the search for new ones.	美国撤军助长了该地区的焦虑情绪，加速了原有联盟的解体和新联盟的构成。
President Barack Obama has ended America’s ruinous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.	奥巴马总统结束了美国在伊拉克和阿富汗的毁灭性战争。
Above all, it was the war in Iraq – and thus former President George W. Bush and his neoconservative advisers – that brought Iran to its current position of strategic strength.	归根结底，让伊朗拥有目前战略地位的恰恰是前总统乔治·W·布什及其新保守主义顾问发动的伊拉克战争。
Yet it is Obama who is now regarded as weak in the Middle East.	但现在奥巴马却在中东背负软弱的恶名。
Obama is heavily criticized for not having intervened militarily in Syria, even though his threat to do so subsequently forced President Bashar al-Assad’s government to surrender its chemical weapons.	尽管奥巴马的军事干预威胁后来迫使巴沙尔·阿萨德总统政府交出了化学武器，但他仍因未进行军事干预叙利亚而遭到严厉的批评。
Likewise, far from strengthening Iran further, Obama has pushed the Islamic Republic into a corner by leading the global push for strict economic sanctions.	同样，由奥巴马发起领导的全球性的严厉经济制裁运动不但遏制了伊朗实力进一步增长，而且迫使伊斯兰共和国陷入困境。
To be sure, many aspects of Obama’s policy in the region are worth criticizing – above all, the defensive attitude with which his administration presents it.	奥巴马在诸多领域的地区政策无疑都值得探讨 — — 其中尤以美国政府采取防御性态度最值得批评。
But, rather than weakness, what America’s traditional allies in the Middle East fear most is far-reaching change in the status quo.	但最让美国在中东的传统盟友害怕的却并非软弱，而是当前现状发生意义深远的变革。
And Obama’s policy does indeed appear to be aiming for precisely that: a nuclear détente with Iran, an end to Syria’s civil war by means of a regional security architecture, and a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.	而奥巴马的政策似乎恰恰以此为目标：在核问题上与伊朗缓和关系、建立区域安全架构结束叙利亚内战和敦促双边解决以巴冲突。
It is a policy that sounds almost utopian, given the enormous inertial force of the region’s problems.	考虑到区域问题的巨大惯性，这种政策似乎颇有些乌托邦的味道。
But if, against all expectations, Obama succeeds, his accomplishment will be historic.	但如果奥巴马出人预料地取得了成功，他将取得历史性的成就。
And if he fails?	可如果他失败呢？
The Middle East will continue its slide into mayhem – perversely befitting the upcoming centenary of World War I’s outbreak.	中东局势将与近在眼前的一战爆发百周年纪念日极不相称地持续动荡。
	
Europe’s Act in Ukraine’s Tragedy	乌克兰悲剧中的欧洲行动
BERLIN – Grand political strategy and everyday experience often have a lot in common.	柏林 — — 宏观政治战略和日常经验往往有很多共同之处。
Try, for example, to swallow a salami whole, and you will probably choke to death.	比方说，如果你想吞下一整根意大利香肠，很可能会被噎住。
In the world of high politics, people behave no differently: they slice their salami before consuming it.	高层政坛的所作所为也非常相似：先把香肠切成片再吃。
If they cannot achieve an objective immediately, they approach it patiently, step by step.	如果不能马上达到目的，那就耐心地分步行事。
Today, the Kremlin is employing such “salami tactics” vis-à-vis Ukraine.	今天，克里姆林对乌克兰采取的就是这种“香肠策略 ” 。
Before our eyes, a tragedy in several acts is unfolding, in which the players and their aims are clear.	一部多幕悲剧正在我们面前上演，演员及其目标都十分明确。
What is not known is how many more acts this sad political spectacle will have, and thus when – and how – it will end.	我们不知道的是这部政治悲剧还会上演多少幕，因此也不知道它将在什么时候以何种方式结尾。
The first act began in the fall of 2013, when then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych duped the European Union and its leaders by refusing to sign a long-planned association agreement.	这部戏的第一幕发生在2013年的秋天，时任乌克兰总统亚努科维奇欺骗了欧盟及其领导人，拒绝签署一份长期策划的入盟协议。
Instead, he chose to have Ukraine enter a customs union with Russia, in exchange for a pile of cash and cheap oil and natural gas.	相反，他选择让乌克兰加入俄罗斯关税同盟，以换取大笔的现金和廉价的石油天然气。
Russian President Vladimir Putin seemed to have achieved his political aim, namely to bring Ukraine, which had been drifting toward Europe throughout the post-Soviet period, firmly back into the Kremlin’s sphere of influence.	俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京似乎已实现了自己的政治目的，那就是把整个后苏联时代一直向欧洲靠拢的乌克兰强硬地拉回到克里姆林的势力领域。
The second act was staged by the Ukrainian people, who, in the west of the country and on the Maidan in Kyiv, rebelled against Yanukovych’s effort to align their country more closely with Russia.	乌克兰民众是第二幕的主角，在乌克兰西部和基辅的独立广场，他们抗议亚努科维奇让乌克兰靠拢俄罗斯的努力。
After three months of protests, the uprising led to Yanukovych’s ouster, temporarily derailing Putin’s plan to vassalize Ukraine peacefully.	三个月的抗议活动后，民众起义导致亚努科维奇下台，普京和平吞并乌克兰的计划暂时脱轨。
It was not NATO, the EU, or the United States that acted to block Ukraine’s shift eastwards. Yanukovych was chased from power by a significant majority of Ukrainians themselves.	阻止乌克兰向东靠拢的不是北约、欧盟或者美国，是绝大多数乌克兰民众将亚努科维奇赶到台下。
The third act was born of Putin’s domestic political situation, and resulted in a stopgap solution that led to Russia’s poorly disguised armed invasion, and then annexation, of Crimea.	普京面临的国内政治局势催生了第三幕，并最终导致了俄罗斯对克里米亚欲盖弥彰的武装入侵和吞并。
Without Crimea’s annexation, Putin faced domestic political disaster and a premature end to his dream of reenacting Ivan the Great’s “gathering of the Russian lands” and restoring Russia’s global power.	如果不吞并乌克兰，普京将面临国内政治灾难，以及他再次上演伊凡大帝“重整俄国河山”及恢复俄罗斯全球势力梦想的提前终结。
But Putin’s aim has never been Russian control only of Crimea; he has always wanted all of Ukraine, because he fears nothing more than a successful, democratic, modern neighbor that undermines by example the authority of his own “managed democracy.”	但普京的目标从来不止停留在控制克里米亚；他一直想把乌克兰整个收入囊中，因为他担心没有什么比一个实实在在成功、民主、现代化的邻国更能破坏他自己所谓 “管理民主” 权威。
So now we have reached the tragedy’s fourth act, in which Russia attempts to grab eastern Ukraine, and the West responds.	因此我们看到了悲剧的第四幕，即俄罗斯试图攫取乌克兰东部，而西部对此做出了反应。
Annexing eastern Ukraine – and thus splitting the country in two – by force has much less support, even among Russian-speakers, than the operation in Crimea.	武力吞并东乌克兰 — — 并借此分裂国家 — — 的支持率即使在讲俄语的民众中也远低于克里米亚行动。
The aim of Russia’s covert military intervention there is to destabilize Ukraine in the long term by using stage-managed “unrest” to delegitimize the May 25 presidential election in the short term, thereby preventing consolidation of the post-Yanukovych political order.	俄国秘密军事干预的目的是破坏乌克兰的长期稳定，短期内利用阶段化管理的“动乱”来破坏5月25日的总统选举，并借此防止后亚努科维奇时代政治秩序的巩固。
The task for the West is to stabilize Ukraine by economic and political means and contain Russian expansionism.	西方国家的任务是以经济政治手段稳定乌克兰并遏制俄罗斯的扩张势头。
The Kremlin, not surprisingly, is seeking to make any Western response as expensive and uncomfortable as possible, by implementing its destabilization strategy before our eyes, step by step, hoping that a frustrated Europe and America will one day throw in the towel.	毫无疑问，克里姆林想竭尽全力让西方的任何举措尽可能地昂贵和难受，通过在我们眼前分步实施其破坏性战略，俄罗斯寄希望于沮丧的欧洲和美国有一天会主动认输。
It is foreseeable that neither Russia nor the West will be strong enough to achieve its aims fully in Ukraine.	可以预见无论是俄罗斯还是西方都没有强大到能在乌克兰完全实现自己的目的。
It would therefore be sensible for both sides to try, together with the Ukrainians, to reconcile their interests.	因此，明智的做法是双方和乌克兰民众一道尝试调和自身的利益。
But that would require Putin to abandon his strategic ambitions, which he will never do so long as he can continue to slice the salami.	但这就需要普京放弃自己的战略野心，但只要他能继续实行“香肠切片”战略，他就永远不甘心这样做。
Dulling Putin’s knife and ending the Ukraine crisis peacefully depends largely on the EU.	钝化普京的利刃及和平结束乌克兰危机大半取决于欧盟的表现。
Sanctions will not impress Putin (he and his cronies are isolating Russia economically and financially more effectively than most sanctions could); peaceful yet tangible political steps within Europe will.	制裁措施不会打动普京（他和他的亲信从经济和金融领域孤立俄罗斯的效果比绝大多数制裁措施更加有效 ） ； 但欧洲内部和平而切实的政治措施却可以收到这样的效果。
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has made the right suggestion here: prompt establishment of a European energy union, starting with the market for natural gas and including joint external representation and a common pricing policy.	波兰总理图斯克已就此提出了正确的建议：推动成立欧洲能源联盟，从天然气市场开始，逐渐采取联合对外代表和共同定价政策。
This step, combined with further differentiation among supplier countries and progress toward implementing renewable-energy technologies, would invert the balance of power between the EU (Russia’s most important customer for oil and natural gas) and the Kremlin.	上述步骤加之供应国进一步差异化及推动可再生能源技术进步，可以扭转欧盟（俄罗斯最重要的石油天然气客户）和克里姆林之间的权力平衡局面。
If, at the same time, Poland resolved to join the euro at the earliest possible opportunity, Putin’s challenge to Eastern Europe would receive a powerful and completely peaceful answer.	如果同时波兰决意尽早加入欧元区，就等于和平但有力地回击了普京对东欧地区的挑战。
And Poland would assume the role of a major player at the center of an increasingly integrated Europe.	而波兰将在日益一体化的欧洲中心扮演越来越重要的角色。
It has largely been Germany that has opposed integrating Europe’s energy and natural gas markets.	基本上只有德国反对欧洲能源和天然气市场一体化。
After the tragedy in Ukraine, no one in Berlin will be able to defend this stance, particularly given that Germany’s leaders do not want to confront Russia through sanctions.	乌克兰悲剧发生后，特别是在德国领导人不愿采取制裁措施对抗俄国的情况下，柏林再没有人能为这一立场进行辩护。
There will no longer be any room for excuses about why an energy union should be rejected.	再也没有任何借口能拒绝能源联盟的建立。
Everyone knows now what this communality called Europe is about.	人人都知道欧洲所谓的共同属性是什么。
To borrow from Aesop’s “The Braggart”: Hic Rhodus, hic salta!	借用伊索寓言“自吹自擂的人”中的一句话： Hic Rhodus, hic salta！
Enough said, Europe.	欧洲已经说得够多了。
Now show us!	现在必须采取行动！
	
The Great War’s Long Shadow	大战的长期阴影
BERLIN – This year marks the centennial of the outbreak of World War I, which is reason enough to reflect on what this seminal European catastrophe teaches us today.	柏林—今年是第一次世界大战爆发一百周年，光是这一理由便已足以让我们反思这场欧洲的灾难对今天的意义。
Indeed, the Great War’s consequences for international relations and the global system of states continue to be felt.	事实上，一战对国际关系和全球国家体系所造成的后果至今仍能感受到。
So, have we learned anything from the policy failures of governments, institutions, and international diplomacy that occurred in the summer of 1914?	那么，我们从1914夏天所发生的政府、制度和国际外交方面的政策失误中学到了什么？
Large parts of the northern hemisphere continue to struggle with the legacies of the great European empires – Habsburg, Russian, and Ottoman – that collapsed in WWI’s wake, or whose decline, like that of the British Empire, was initiated by the war and sealed by its even bloodier sequel a generation later.	北半球的大部分地区仍在欧洲大帝国 — — 哈布斯堡、沙俄和奥斯曼 — — 因为一战而崩溃所造成的后果中挣扎，更有一些帝国 — — 如大英帝国 — — 因为一战而衰落，并且因为二十多年后的另��场更加血腥的战争而板上钉钉。
The resulting fracture zones – in the Balkans and the Middle East, for example – are the source of some of today’s gravest risks to regional and even world peace.	由此所造成的分裂区 — — 如巴尔干半岛和中东 — — 成为当今地区乃至世界和平的最大风险源。
After the Cold War’s end and the collapse of the Russian Empire’s Soviet successor, war returned to the Balkans under very similar conditions to those that prevailed in the period before 1914, with aggressive nationalism ultimately reconfiguring the disintegrating Yugoslavia as six separate states.	冷战结束以及沙俄帝国的后继者苏联解体后，战争回到了巴尔干半岛，因为那里的情况变得与1914年前极为相似，最后，激进的民族主义把南斯拉夫打散重组为六个独立国家。
Of course, Serbian President Slobodan Milošević, whose call for a “Greater Serbia” triggered the war, was not alone: For a moment, Europe was in danger of reverting to the confrontation of 1914, with France and the United Kingdom supporting Serbia, and Germany and Austria favoring Croatia.	当然，以提出“大塞尔维亚”而引发战争的塞尔维亚总统米洛舍维奇（Slobodan Milošević）并不孤独：有一段时间，欧洲大有重回1914年冲突之势，法国和英国支持塞尔维亚，德国和奥地利站在克罗地亚一边。
Fortunately, there was no relapse, because the West had learned its lessons from historical mistakes.	幸运的是，故态没有复萌，因为西方从历史错误中汲取了教训。
Today, three factors loom large in the avoidance of disaster: the United States’ military presence in Europe, the progress of European integration, and Europe’s abandonment of great-power politics.	如今，三大因素有助于有效地避免灾难：美国在欧洲的驻军、欧洲一体化进程以及欧洲放弃了大国政治。
Yet there is no point in fooling oneself: Only as long as the Balkan countries believe in the European Union and the benefits of membership will today’s precarious peace in the region become permanent.	但我们也不能自欺欺人：只有巴尔干国家相信欧盟并因为加入欧盟而获益，今天在该地区如履薄冰的和平才能持久。
No such hope currently exists for the Middle East, whose contemporary political borders were largely established by Britain and France during WWI, when the diplomats Mark Sykes and François Georges-Picot negotiated the division of the Ottoman Empire.	中东则不存在这样的希望。 当代中东的政治边界大体由英国和法国在一战期间划定，双方外交官赛克斯（Mark Sykes）和皮科（François Georges-Picot）商议了分割奥斯曼帝国的计划。
Likewise, the creation of Israel harks back to the 1917 Balfour Declaration, whereby the subsequent British mandatory power in Palestine supported the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people.	类似地，以色列的建立可以追溯到1917年巴尔福宣言（Balfour Declaration ） ， 后来巴勒斯坦英国托管政权据此支持为犹太人建立一个国家。
The Middle East created back then is, more or less, the Middle East today.	当时所建立起来的欧洲或多或少地就是今天的欧洲。
Yet we are now witnessing its disintegration, because the Sykes-Picot design always implied a strong external hegemonic power (or two) able and willing to maintain stability by channeling (or suppressing) the region’s numerous conflicts.	但如今我们正在目睹中东的分崩离析，因为赛克斯-皮科方案需要一个（或两个）强大的外部霸权能够也愿意通过疏导（或镇压）该地区的众多冲突维持稳定。
Great Britain and France, the first hegemonic powers, were succeeded by the US and the Soviet Union – and, finally, by the US alone.	一开始的霸权是英国和法国，后来是美国和苏联，最后只剩下美国一个。
America’s misadventure in Iraq, its exhaustion as a world power, and its unwillingness to maintain its previous level of commitment to the region have rendered the Sykes-Picot structure untenable, because no other external force for order is available.	美国在伊拉克的出师不利、其作为世界超级大国的衰落以及其不愿维持如同过去那样的对中东地区的干涉程度导致赛克斯-皮科结构不再能够维持下去，因为再无其他外部势力或秩序可用。
The resulting vacuum has been filled by various currents of political Islam, terrorism, protest movements, uprisings, secession attempts by national or religious minorities, and aspiring regional hegemons (Iran and Saudi Arabia).	填补由此造成的真空的是如今一波又一波的政治伊斯兰教、恐怖主义、反抗运动、起义、民主或宗教少数派的分裂活动以及雄心勃勃的地区霸权（伊朗和沙特阿拉伯 ） 。
Indeed, the partial withdrawal of the US implies that the end of the enforced stability of the old Middle East will not spare the Sykes-Picot borders.	事实上，美国的局部撤退意味着旧中东的强迫稳定的结束不会仅限于赛克斯-皮科边界。
Developments in Syria and Iraq already suggest as much, and the future of Lebanon and Jordan has become increasingly uncertain.	叙利亚和伊拉克的局面已经证明了这一点，黎巴嫩和约旦的未来也变得越来越不确定。
One of the few positive features of the region is that no global power rivalries are currently playing out there.	极少数积极特征之一是目前该地区不存在世界级大国的对立。
But the regional struggle for mastery between Iran and Saudi Arabia (with Israel as a third actor) could prove to be all the more dangerous, given the prevailing – and deeply entrenched – mindset of traditional power politics.	但是，考虑到主流的、根深蒂固的传统实力政治思维，伊朗和沙特阿拉伯（以色列则是第三方）质检的霸权之争可能十分危险。
Institutions and traditions supporting cooperative conflict resolution hardly exist in the region.	支持合作性冲突解决方案的制度和传统在该地区几乎不存在。
The memory of 1914 may trigger the most concern in East Asia, where all the ingredients of a similar disaster have accumulated: nuclear weapons, the rise of China as a global power, unresolved territorial and border disputes, the division of the Korean Peninsula, historical resentments, an obsession with status and prestige, and hardly any cooperative conflict-resolution mechanisms.	对1914年的记忆可能引发亚洲最大的隐忧，在亚洲，爆发类似于一战的灾难的所有要素都已经积累起来：核武器、中国崛起为全球强国、悬而未决的领土和边境纠纷、朝鲜半岛的分裂、历史恩怨，对地位和特权的着迷，以及缺乏任何合作性冲突解决机制。
Distrust and power politics are the order of the day.	不信任和实力政治就是当前的秩序。
And yet there are grounds for optimism in East Asia.	但对于东亚同样存在了管理有。
The world has changed dramatically since the summer of 1914.	世界从1914年夏天以来已有了显著的变化。
At the time, the world’s population was two billion; now it is seven billion.	当时，世界人口只有二十亿；如今是七十亿。
This, together with the communications revolution, has created even more interdependencies and has forced more cooperation upon governments – as has the continued presence of the US as a stabilizer in the region, which has proved to be indispensable.	这一点加上通信革命已经造成更大的相互依赖型，并迫使各国更多地建立政府间的合作 — — 比如美国一直作为稳定器存在于该地区，其作用被证明是不可或缺的。
Moreover, while nuclear weapons pose a continuing danger, they also inhibit the risk of war as a means of power politics by making mutual destruction a certainty.	此外，尽管核武器代表了永久性威胁，但也因为让互相毁灭成为笃定之事而降低了将战争作为实力政治手段的风险。
Military technology, the mindset of politicians and citizens, the structure of international diplomacy, and much more have changed in the century since WWI erupted.	军事技术、政治家和人民的思维、国际外交结构以及其他诸多因素改变了自一战爆发以来的这个世纪。
And, yes, we have even learned a few things from history, which has made the world safer.	是的，我们甚至从历史中学到了一些教训，这让世界变得更加安全。
But, lest we forget: in the summer 1914, most actors regarded the impending disaster as an impossibility.	但是，我们不能忘记，在1914年夏天，大部分行动方也认为即将到来的灾难是不可能事件。
	
Europe’s Ukrainian Blunder	欧洲在乌克兰问题上严重失策
BERLIN – The European Union has probably never experienced anything like it before: Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych’s government pretended to negotiate an association agreement, only to back out at the last minute.	柏林—欧盟可能从未遇到过这样的经验：乌克兰总统亚努科维奇的政府装作与欧盟谈判加入协定，直到最后一刻突然反悔。
EU leaders felt duped; in Moscow, however, the mood was celebratory.	欧盟领导人有被骗的感觉，而在莫斯科，则是群情激动。
As we now know, Yanukovych’s real motivation for the negotiations was to raise the price that Russia would have to pay to keep Ukraine in its strategic orbit.	现在我们知道，亚努科维奇谈判的真正动机是提高俄罗斯拉拢乌克兰的出价。
Only a few days later, Yanukovych and Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a Russian loan worth $15 billion, a cut in natural-gas prices, and various trade agreements.	几天后，亚努科维奇和俄罗斯总统普京宣布俄罗斯将向乌克兰提供价值150亿美元的贷款、降低天然气价格，并签订一系列贸易协议。
From Yanukovych’s point of view, this agreement made sense in the short run: the gas deal would help Ukraine survive the winter, the loan would help keep it from defaulting on its debt, and the Russian market, on which the economy depends, would remain open.	从亚努科维奇的角度看，这一协议在短期相当有效：天然气协议有助于乌克兰度过严冬，贷款有助于避免债务违约，而乌克兰经济所依靠的俄罗斯市场也将保持大门敞开。
In the medium term, however, by rejecting the EU and embracing Russia, Ukraine faces the risk of losing its independence – on which the post-Soviet order in Europe depends.	但是，从中期看，拒绝欧盟、投入俄罗斯怀抱的乌克兰有可能丧失其独立性，而这一独立性也是后苏联时代欧洲秩序的基础。
In terms of its strategic orientation, Ukraine is a divided country.	从战略方向角度看，乌克兰已经陷入分裂。
Its eastern and southern regions (especially Crimea) want to return to Russia, whereas its western and northern regions insist on moving toward Europe.	东部和南部（特别是克里米亚）希望回归俄罗斯，而西部和北部坚持倒向欧洲。
For the foreseeable future, this domestic conflict can be resolved, if at all, only with a lot of violence involved, as the ongoing mass protests in Kyiv suggest.	在可预见的未来，这一国内冲突只有通过暴力才可能得到解决，基辅的大规模游行示威已经说明了这一点。
But no sensible person can seriously desire such an outcome.	但没有任何理由去追求这一结果。
Ukraine needs a peaceful, democratic solution, and this will be found only within the status quo.	乌克兰需要和平、民主的解决方案，而这唯有在现状框架内才能找到。
The EU’s behavior demands explanation.	欧盟的行动需要扩大。
Yanukovych had always been the Kremlin’s ally.	亚努科维奇一直是克里姆林宫的盟友。
Indeed, his election in 2010 marked the end of Ukraine’s pro-European Orange Revolution, which had defeated his effort to steal the presidential election in 2004 and keep Ukraine in the Russian camp.	事实上，2010年亚努科维奇当选总统标志着乌克兰亲欧洲的橙色革命的结束。 2004年的橙色革命挫败了他窃取总统宝座、将乌克兰引向俄罗斯阵营的图谋。
So why did the EU press for an association agreement, without being able to offer Ukraine anything comparable to what Russia offered?	那么，欧盟为什么还要在无法提供能与俄罗斯相媲美的条件的情况下与乌克兰展开入盟谈判呢？
The answer can be found in the relationship between Europe and Russia.	答案可以在欧洲和俄罗斯的关系中寻找。
With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia not only lost its status as a world power; within Europe, it was forced to withdraw toward a frontier that it had extended westward since Peter the Great – ultimately to the Elbe and Thuringia.	苏联解体后，俄罗斯不但失去了欧洲超级大国地位，也被迫从彼得大帝以来不断向西扩张、一度曾到达易北河和图林根的版图上退却。
After Putin succeeded Boris Yeltsin as President of the Russian Federation, he followed three strategic goals, which he continues to pursue: an end to post-Soviet Russia’s strategic submission to the West; reestablishment of sovereignty over most of the ex-Soviet republics, or at least enough control over them to stop NATO’s eastward expansion; and gradual recovery of Russia’s status as a global power.	普京接替叶利钦成为俄罗斯联邦总统后一直在追求三大战略目标：停止自苏联解体以来对西方的屈服；重新建立对大部分前苏联共和国的主权，或至少获得足够的控制权阻止北约东扩；以及逐渐恢复俄罗斯全球超级大国的地位。
These goals were not to be enforced by the Red Army, but by Russia’s economic potential, especially a strategic energy policy supported by vast oil and natural-gas reserves.	这些目标的推动力量不是红军，而是俄��斯的经济实力，特别是倚靠巨量石油和天然气储量的战略性能源政策。
This would require securing control over these resources. It would also require establishing new export routes to Europe that, by circumventing Ukraine, would make the country vulnerable to blackmail, because a cutoff of gas supplies to it would no longer trouble Europe.	这就需要确保对这些资源的控制，此外还需要建立新的对欧出口模式 — — 绕过乌克兰，让乌克兰处于非常被动的局面，因为切断对乌供气不会影响到欧洲。
The ultimate goal would be to regain Russian control over the Ukrainian pipeline network.	其最终目标是让俄罗斯重新获得对乌克兰管网的控制。
At that point, Ukraine could be coaxed into joining Putin’s “Eurasian Union,” a Russian alternative to the EU aimed at keeping ex-Soviet countries within Russia’s sphere of influence.	然后就可以引诱乌克兰加入普京的“欧亚联盟 ” （ Eurasian Union，俄罗斯提出的与欧盟抗衡的联盟，旨在保持俄罗斯对前苏联国家的控制 ） 。
Apart from using the Nord Stream and South Stream pipelines to disconnect Ukraine from Russian energy exports to Europe, the Kremlin successfully blocked European access to the hydrocarbon-rich Caspian Sea and Central Asia.	除了用北方（Nord Stream）和南方（South Stream）管网将乌克兰与俄罗斯对欧能源出口分离，克里姆林宫还成功地阻止了欧洲与富于能源的里海和中亚的联系。
Virtually the only way that countries like Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan can export their output to the West is via Russia’s pipeline network.	阿塞拜疆、土库曼斯坦和哈萨克斯坦等国家只有通过俄罗斯的管网才能向西方出口能源。
The sole exception, the Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline from Azerbaijan to Turkey, was pushed through by the United States; Europe has done nothing similar.	唯一的例外是阿塞拜疆到土耳其的巴库-第比利斯-杰伊汉（BTC）石油管道，该管道为美国所设，欧洲在这方面毫无作为。
None of this is exactly a secret in Western capitals; on the contrary, Putin’s ultimate goal – a far-reaching revision of the post-Cold War strategic order in Europe – has become increasingly clear as Russia has moved closer to achieving it.	这些对西方国家都不是秘密；相反，普京的最终目标 — — 改变后冷战时代的欧洲战略秩序 — — 也随着俄罗斯向这一目标的步步逼近而变得日渐清晰。
But neither the EU nor the US has been willing or able (so far) to formulate an effective response.	但不管是欧盟还是美国，都不愿或不能（到目前为止）予以有效应对。
The EU’s Ukraine initiative was supposed to be an attempt to provide such an answer.	欧盟的乌克兰计划将试图提供一个解决方案。
Europe played for high stakes, because if Ukraine does lose its independence in one way or another, European security will be at risk – a risk nowhere more keenly felt than in Poland and the Baltic states.	欧洲的赌注很大，因为如果乌克兰以某种方式失去其独立性，欧洲的安全就将告急 — — 尤其是波兰和波罗的海国家。
With Yanukovych’s rejection of the association agreement, the EU has lost its bet.	亚努科维奇拒绝入盟协议意味着欧盟已经输掉了这场豪赌。
Putin cannot be faulted for skillfully pursuing his interpretation of Russian interests.	普京追求俄罗斯的利益无可厚非。
The blame for the outcome in Ukraine falls squarely on the EU’s leaders, who represented European interests so badly.	乌克兰局面的急转直下完全是欧盟领导人的责任，他们根本没有代表欧洲利益。
Grand gestures and paper-thin statements cannot mask Europe’s neglect of its own strategic interests, which will not be helpful in its relations with Russia.	装腔作势和文过饰非无法掩盖欧洲队其自身战略利益的忽视，也无助于其与俄罗斯的关系。
If Europeans want to change this, they will have to invest in their interests and devise an effective approach to ensure that these investments pay off.	如果欧洲人想改变这一局面，就必须投资于自身利于，并以有效的方式确保这些投资获得回报。
This is true not only with respect to Ukraine.	不仅在乌克兰问题上是如此。
At the end of 2013, Russian diplomacy can look back on a year of impressive successes: Syria, the interim nuclear agreement with Iran, and now Ukraine’s rejection of Europe.	在2013年行将结束之际，回顾一整年，俄罗斯外交硕果累累：叙利亚、伊朗临时核协议，最近又有乌克兰拒绝欧洲。
Whether Europe’s leaders see the connections and understand the consequences remains a serious question.	欧洲领导人是否看到了其中的联系、明白其中的后果仍然是个严重的问题。
That fact alone gives rise to considerable concern.	这一事实就足以引起巨大的担忧。
	
Defusing Iran	接触伊朗的风险
BERLIN – On February 18, crucial negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program began in Vienna between Iran and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany (the P5+1).	柏林 — — 2月18日，联合国安理会五大常任理事国加德国（P5+1）与伊朗间就伊朗核计划的关键谈判在维也纳开始。
The alternative to the talks is a further nuclear buildup by Iran, followed by additional international sanctions and, eventually, another war in the Middle East, which no one believes can resolve the problem.	谈判的替代方案是任由伊朗核问题继续发酵，进一步加码国际制裁并最终引发又一场中东战争。 没有人认为这种方法能够解决问题。
So, can a comprehensive agreement that respects Iran’s right to civilian nuclear energy, while allaying the international community’s fears of weaponization, be achieved?	那么，究竟能否签署一项尊重伊朗民用核能权、同时又能缓解国际社会对核能武器化担忧的全面协议？
The interim agreement reached last November in Geneva reflected the West’s de facto acceptance that Iran is entitled to carry out limited low-grade uranium enrichment within the framework of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).	去年十一月在日内瓦达成临时协议，这表明西方在事实上承认了伊朗在核不扩散条约（NPT）框架内进行有限度低级铀浓缩的权利。
The West released about $7 billion of frozen Iranian funds and relaxed some sanctions (in particular, on crude oil and auto parts), while Iran agreed to a quasi-freeze of its nuclear program.	西方解冻了约70亿美元被冻结的伊朗资金，此外还放宽了某些制裁限制（尤其是在原油和汽车零部件领域 ） ， 而伊朗则同意对其核计划采取准冻结措施。
That created the basis for a lasting agreement. But realizing that potential will be difficult.	虽然这项进展为最终订立持久协议打下了基础，但将这种可能性变为现实还需要经过艰苦的努力。
First and foremost, a mountain of mutual distrust will need to be overcome.	首先，双方需要解决相互不信任的问题。
The West and Israel do not believe that Iran’s nuclear program is meant to serve merely civilian aims.	西方和以色列并不相信伊朗的核计划仅仅服务于民用目的。
Otherwise, why would Iran invest billions of dollars in a program that is almost tailor-made for military purposes, including long-distance delivery systems?	否则伊朗怎么会为一项几乎纯粹为军事目的服务的计划投资数十亿美元，其中还包括研制远程运输系统？
The Iranian leadership, for its part, remains convinced that the United States still seeks to bring about regime change.	而伊朗领导人仍然相信美国依旧以政��更迭为目的。
From Iran’s perspective, accepting an American hand extended in a spirit of conciliation could turn it into a fist.	从伊朗的角度看，美国以调停为目的伸出的手可能演变为重拳出击。
Moreover, any compromise would be fiercely contested within both camps, possibly leading to serious domestic political conflict.	此外，任何妥协都可能在两方阵营引发严重的争议，甚至可能导致严重的国内政治冲突。
And even if both sides’ current leaderships are sincere, will this hold true for their successors?	而且就算双方目前领导人本着真诚的态度，他们的继任者是否也能如此？
The absence of trust between Iran and the West leads directly to the second obstacle to a comprehensive agreement: verification and monitoring.	伊朗和西方间欠缺信任也直接导致了达成全面协议的另一个障碍：那就是核查和监测措施。
The central issue in these negotiations, around which everything else revolves, concerns Iran’s “breakout capability” – the time it would need, within the framework of any agreement with the West, to renege and build a nuclear weapon.	谈判中的一切都围绕伊朗“突破能力”这一核心问题。 具体来讲，就是伊朗在西方协议框架下会用多长时间背信弃义制造出核武器。
How much supervision will be required not just to verify compliance but also to detect any possible attempt at a breakout?	如何监管才能确保伊朗遵守协议规定，并发现可能突破的蛛丝马迹？
The technical questions are complex, and the proverbial devil really is in the countless details.	技术问题的确复杂，众所周知魔鬼也的确藏在无数细节中。
But prospects for a deal will hinge on resolving three broad issues.	但能否达成协议将取决于能否解决三大问题。
The first two issues reflect the two paths toward the bomb: uranium enrichment and plutonium production.	前两个问题反映了制造核弹的两条必由之路：铀浓缩和钚制造。
Any workable agreement will require Iran to renounce uranium enrichment above the 5% level needed for a civilian nuclear-power program; accept limits on enrichment volumes, the number of centrifuges, and technology; agree to forgo reprocessing; and address operations at the heavy-water reactor in Arak.	任何可行的协议都要求伊朗放弃高于民用核能项目要求的5%以上的铀浓缩计划;伊朗还必须接受提取数量上的限制，离心机的数量和技术；同意放弃后处理并妥善处理阿拉克重水反应堆的操作。
The third issue concerns supervision and monitoring, which for quite some time would probably have to go beyond that agreed in the Additional Protocol to the NPT and include certain military installations.	第三个问题与督促和监测机制有关，它在特定时间内很可能会超出双方同意的不扩散条约附加议定书的范畴，并包含某些特定的军事设施。
Indeed, the duration the agreement will be of vital importance.	事实上，协议的持续时间在这里至关重要。
The West wants it to be implemented for as long as possible, while Iran would prefer a very short timeframe within which to achieve its central objectives: a comprehensive and lasting repeal of international sanctions and recognition as an NPT non-military nuclear power.	西方希望持续的时间越长越好，而伊朗则希望在短时间内达到其全面永久废除国际制裁和跻身不扩散核武器条约非军用有核国家的核心目标。
That raises another important question: Does US President Barack Obama really have a domestic mandate for negotiating a comprehensive repeal of the sanctions?	由此又引出了另外一个重要问题：那就是美国总统奥巴马是否真的能在全面废止制裁措施的谈判中说话算数？
Here, we are brought back to the central issue in this process: technical questions, though important, are still only an expression of the underlying political conflicts and animosities.	这里我们又重新回到整个过程的核心：技术问题无论多重要，仍始终不过是表达了潜在的仇恨和政治冲突。
These are the real factors driving the confrontation that the Vienna negotiations are meant to defuse over the next six months.	这些才是今后六个月维也纳谈判想要化解对抗的真正驱动因素。
And the current regional and sectarian confrontation in the Middle East affects the nuclear negotiations directly.	而当前的中东地区和宗派对抗才是核谈判的直接影响因素。
All of the relevant players – including those, like Saudi Arabia and Israel, that are not sitting at the table but whose presence is very much felt – are clinging to their initial positions.	包括像沙特和以色列在内的所有相关势力虽然没有直接坐到谈判桌前，但他们的影响力却是切实存在的。 这些国家都坚持他们最初的立场。
The US does not want Iran to become a military nuclear power or gain regional predominance; above all, the Americans do not want another Middle East war.	美国不希望伊朗成为军事核国家或占据地区优势；毕竟美国人不希望中东再燃战火。 但伊朗则力争成为（非军事？
Iran, however, wants to become a (non-military?) nuclear power and shape a region in which it is heavily involved militarily (in Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq).	）核国家，在本国大量驻军的地区（叙利亚、黎巴嫩和伊拉克）扮演举足轻重的角色。
Europe shares the US position, but is more flexible.	欧洲与美国有着相似的立场，但欧洲人的态度却更加灵活。
Saudi Arabia, a Sunni power, wants to stop Shia Iran from becoming an emerging or, worse still, a military nuclear power in the Gulf, and has taken the opposite side in Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq.	逊尼派强国沙特希望阻止伊朗成为海湾地区新兴核力量甚至是军事核力量，并且在叙利亚、黎巴嫩和伊拉克都采取了与伊朗对立的态度。
Israel opposes Iran’s becoming a military nuclear power – or even a nuclear-threshold state – and is willing to try to prevent this by military means.	以色列则反对伊朗成为军事核力量 — — 甚至于基本核力量 — — 而且不惜使用武力达到自己的目标。
To achieve a sustainable compromise that all sides accept (even if with gritted teeth), the negotiations must be accompanied by diplomatic steps aimed at building trust both in the region and beyond.	为了实现各方都能接受的长期妥协（就算其中有人在咬牙切齿 ） ， 谈判就必须辅之以在区域内外建立信任的外交步骤。
Europe is very well versed in such processes and should put its experience to good use.	欧洲人非常熟悉这样的过程，应该很好利用自身经验完成这样的任务。
Iran must decide whether it wants to follow the North Korean route to international isolation, or some variation on the Chinese route to integration into the global economy.	伊朗必须决定是否要追随朝鲜的国际孤立线路，还是采取某种类似于中国的方式融入全球经济的范畴。
It must also understand that its relationship with both Israel and Saudi Arabia will affect the negotiations, either positive or negatively.	它还必须明白与以色列和沙特阿拉伯的关系会影响到谈判结果，而这种影响不是正面就是负面的。
And the West – the US, Europe, and, more than any other country, Israel – will have to get used to the idea of living with an Iranian civilian nuclear-power program, while limiting Iran’s capacity to become an emerging military nuclear power.	而西方（美国和欧洲，尤其是以色列）一定要接受与伊朗民用核计划共存的思想，同时限制伊朗成为新兴的核军事强国。
As the very different examples of the Soviet Union and China show, the Iranian regime might someday collapse or change fundamentally – probably when hardly anyone expects it.	虽然两者差别很大，但苏联和中国的例子都表明伊朗政权或许会在某天崩溃或发生根本变化 — — 很可能是在任何人都没有预料到时候。
Until then, we must do our best to defuse the nuclear time bomb together.	在此之前，我们必须竭尽全力共同化解伊朗这颗核定时炸弹的威胁。
	
Emerging Economies on Their Own	自谋生路的新兴市场
NEW YORK – There was a remarkable similarity between European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s statement after a recent meeting of the ECB Governing Council and US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen’s first testimony to Congress: both asserted that their policy decisions would take into account only domestic conditions.	发自纽约 — — 欧洲央行行长马里奥·德拉吉（Mario Draghi）最近在与欧洲央行管理委员会开会后发表的声明和美联储主席珍妮特·耶伦首次国会听证中的言论极为相似 — — 两者都宣称自己的政策决策只会考虑国内状况。
In other words, emerging-market countries, though subject to significant spillover effects from advanced economies’ monetary policies, are on their own.	换言之，那些新兴市场国家虽然承受了来自发达经济体货币政策的极大溢出效应，但也只能自谋生路了。
This confirms what emerging-country authorities have known for a while.	其实新兴国家政府要就意识到了这一点，只是现在才最终得到确认而已。
In 2010 – following the Fed’s announcement of a third round of quantitative easing – Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega accused advanced countries of waging a global “currency war.”	2010年时 — — 就在美联储宣布进行第三轮量化宽松政策之后 — — 巴西财政部长吉多·曼特加（Guido Mantega）就指责发达经济体发动了一场全球性“货币战争 ” 。
After all, advanced economies’ policies were driving large and volatile capital flows into the major emerging markets, pushing up their exchange rates and damaging their export competitiveness – a phenomenon that Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff later referred to as a “capital tsunami.”	毕竟发达国家的政策正驱使大量短期资本流入各大新兴市场国家，导致后者汇率上涨并削弱其出口竞争力 — — 巴西总统迪尔玛·罗塞夫最后将这一现场称之为“资本海啸 ” 。
Recently, the impact of the advanced economies’ withdrawal of monetary stimulus has been just as strong.	最近发达经济体退出货币刺激政策所造成的影响也同样严重。
Since last May, when the Fed announced its intention to begin tapering its asset purchases, capital has become less accessible and more expensive for emerging economies – a shift that has been particularly painful for countries whose large current-account deficits leave them dependent on foreign finance.	自去年五月美联储宣布有意缩减资产收购规模以来，新兴市场国家的资金获取渠道不断缩窄，融资成本日渐上升 — — 这对那些拥有大额经常帐户赤字并因此依赖国际融资的国家来说尤为痛苦。
In response, Raghuram Rajan, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, has called advanced-country policies “selfish,” declaring that “international monetary cooperation has broken down.”	对此印度储备银行行长拉古兰·拉贾（Raghuram Rajan）回应说发达国家的政策相当“自私 ” ， 并宣称“国际货币合作体系已经崩溃 。 ”
To be sure, emerging economies have plenty of their own problems to address.	无可否认，新兴经济体自身都存在着许多亟待解决的问题。
But there is no denying that these countries have been victims of advanced economies’ monetary policies, which have increased capital-flow volatility over the last three decades.	但也不能否认这些国家确实成为了发达国家货币政策的受害者，而这些政策在过去30年中令资金流的波动性不断增大。
According to the International Monetary Fund’s April 2011 World Economic Outlook, though the volatility of capital flows has increased worldwide, it is higher in emerging market economies than in advanced economies.	根据国际货币基金组织发布的《2011年4月实际经济展望 》 ， 虽然资本流动的波动性在全球范围内都有所上升，但新兴经济体的上升幅度要比发达经济体要大。
Boom-bust financial cycles are driven largely by shocks generated in advanced economies, but they are key determinants of emerging markets’ business cycles.	经济兴衰周期主要都是由发达经济体产生的冲击所驱动，但它们又是新兴市场国家商业周期关键决定者。
Moreover, the spillover effects of advanced economies’ monetary policies extend beyond financial shocks.	此外，发达经济体货币政策的溢出效应已经超出了金融冲击的范畴。
Emerging economies are also suffering from the effects of developed countries’ external imbalances – particularly the eurozone’s swelling current-account surplus.	新兴经济体同时也遭到了发达经济体外部失衡状况的影响 — — 尤其是欧元区不断膨胀的经常帐户盈余。
In the last few years, the deficit economies of the eurozone’s periphery – and, more recently, Italy – have undertaken massive external adjustments, while Germany and the Netherlands have sustained their large surpluses.	在过去几年中，位处欧元区核心圈外的逆差经济体 — — 比如说最近的意大利 — — 都实施了大规模的外部调整，同时德国和荷兰还依然维持着自身的大额顺差。
As a result, the burden of offsetting the eurozone’s rising surplus has fallen largely on emerging economies, contributing to their growth slowdown.	因此冲抵欧元区大额顺差的责任就主要落在了新兴经济体身上，导致后者增长放缓。
Such spillover effects are precisely what international policy cooperation – such as the “mutual assessment process” that the G-20 established in 2009 – was supposed to prevent.	这些溢出效应正是国际政策合作机制 — — 例如G20集团2009年建立的“多方评估进程 ” — —原本所要避免的状况。
The IMF has created an elaborate system of multilateral surveillance of major countries’ macroeconomic policies, including the “consolidated multilateral surveillance reports,” the spillover reports for the so-called “systemic five” (the US, the United Kingdom, the eurozone, Japan, and China), and the “external sector reports” assessing global imbalances.	国际货币基金组织创设了一个复杂精密的系统来对主要国家的宏观经济政策进行多边监控，其中包括“整合性多边监察报告 ” ， 以及对所谓“五大系统关键国（美、英、欧、日、中 ） ” 的溢出效应报告，还有评估国际贸易失衡状况的“外部部门报告 ” 。
But this system has proved to be utterly ineffective in preventing spillovers – not least because the Fed and the ECB simply ignore it.	但这一系统最终被证明在防范溢出效应方面极为低效 — — 特别是因为美联储和欧洲央行对此根本不屑一顾。
Given that the US dollar and the euro are the top two international reserve currencies, spillovers should be considered the new normal.	考虑到美元和欧元分别是世界前两大储备货币，溢出效应应该被视为一种新的常态。
Adding insult to injury, the $1.1 trillion appropriations bill for federal-government operations agreed last month by the US Congress does not include any money to recapitalize the IMF, the main instrument of international monetary cooperation.	更糟糕的是，美国国会去年批准的1.1万亿联邦政府年度支出预算案并未包含任何拨付给国际货币基金组织的资金，而后者却是国际货币合作机制的主要工具。
That decision represents yet another setback for IMF reforms aimed at increasing the influence of emerging economies.	那个决定意味着国际货币基金组织旨在增加新兴经济体影响力的改革遭遇了又一次失败。
Given the considerable benefits that stable and prosperous emerging countries bring to the world economy – exemplified by the role that they played in propping up global growth in the wake of the recent crisis – it is in everyone’s interest to change the status quo.	考虑到稳定而繁荣的新兴经济体国家为世界经济带来的巨大好处 — — 例如在最近一连串危机之后催动全球增长中所扮演的角色，对现状的改变符合所有人的利益。
The G-20 and the IMF’s International Monetary and Financial Committee must work to align reality with the rhetoric of macroeconomic-policy cooperation.	G20集团和国际货币基金组织下属的国际货币和金融委员会必须把宏观经济政策合作机制的宗旨和现实达成一致。
For that, the recent statements by Draghi and Yellen should be treated as ground zero.	为此，德拉吉和耶伦最近的言论应当被视为一个基点。
	
Revoking America’s Exorbitant Privilege	废除美国的过度特权
NEW YORK – The ongoing political stalemate in the United States holds two major implications for the international monetary system.	纽约—美国没完没了的政治僵局给国际货币体系带来了两大影响。
The better-known consequence has been deepening uncertainty about the US dollar, the main global reserve currency, and US Treasury securities, supposedly the world’s “safest” financial asset.	为人所熟知的后果是深化了主要全球储备货币 — — 美元和号称世界“最安全”金融资产的美国国债的不确定性。
Not surprisingly, the major investors in US Treasuries, China and Japan, have expressed alarm.	毫不奇怪，美国国债的主要投资者中国和日本纷纷拉响警报。
Simply put, the global economy has at its center a dysfunctional political regime that generates recurrent threats of default on the world’s major reserve asset.	简言之，全球经济的核心占据着一个无法正常运转的政治机制，这套机制时不时发出世界主要储备资产违约的风险。
The second implication is further postponement of the International Monetary Fund’s 2010 quota and governance reforms, which would double member countries’ contributions and modestly increase major emerging economies’ voting power.	第二个影响是国际货币基金组织（IMF）的2010年配额和治理改革被进一步推迟，这项改革将倍增成员国的出资额，并略微提高主要新兴经济体的投票权。
Prior to its approval by the IMF Board in December 2010, the reform, agreed at the G-20 Seoul Summit, had been hailed as a “historic” breakthrough.	在2010年12月被IMF理事会批准之前，已在G-20首尔峰会上达成一致的这一改革方案被称为“历史性”突破。
But history has stalled without approval by the US, which has an effective veto over major IMF decisions.	但没有美国的批准 — — 该国拥有IMF重大决策的实际否决权，历史将停滞不前。
The threat of a US default may well end in a political agreement to raise the US government’s debt ceiling, as occurred in 2011.	美国违约的风险很有可能因为关于提高美国政府债务上限形成了政治一致而结束，这一幕在2011年就发生过。
But, whatever the outcome, the latest episode makes it abundantly clear that our globalized world deserves a better international monetary system than the current “non-system” that evolved in an ad hoc manner after the collapse in the early 1970’s of the initial Bretton Woods arrangements.	但是，无论结果如何，最近的债务上限之争充分表明，我们的全球化的世界应该有一套更好的国际货币体系。 当前的“无体系”实际上是20世纪70年代初布雷顿森林体系崩溃后的权宜之计。
The need to overhaul the international monetary and financial system was one of the basic lessons of the global financial crisis.	修正国际货币和金融体系的需要是全球金融危机最根本的教训之一。
While there have been major, albeit incomplete, reforms of international finance, efforts in 2009 and 2010 to reform the international monetary system – including the proposed changes at the IMF – have led to no significant action.	国际金融方面已经有了重大（尽管有欠全面）的改革，但2009年和2010年改革国际货币体系的努力 — — 包括IMF的变革方案 — — 并未带来重大行动。
The reform proposals came from diverse quarters: the governor of the People’s Bank of China; a commission convened by the United Nations General Assembly on reform of the international monetary and financial system, headed by the Nobel laureate Joseph E. Stiglitz; and the French Palais Royal Initiative, led by former IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus.	改革方案来自各个方向：中国人民银行行长、联合国大会召集的以诺贝尔经济学奖获得者斯蒂格利茨（Joseph Stiglitz）为首的国际货币和金融体系改革委员会，以及以前IMF总裁康德苏（Michel Camdessus）为首的法国王宫倡议（French Palais Royal Initiative ） 。
There have been myriad academic contributions to the debate as well.	学界也纷纷为这一话题出谋划策。
The first element of reform should be to give a greater role to the only true international money that the world now has: the IMF’s Special Drawing Rights, created in 1969 as the result of another dollar crisis.	改革的第一要素应该是给予当今世界唯一真正的国际货币 — — 始创于1969年美元危机后的IMF特别提款权（SDR ） — —更大的角色。
The establishment of SDRs was accompanied by a commitment, included in the IMF Articles of Agreement, to “making the special drawing right the principal reserve asset in the international monetary system” (Article VIII, Section 7 and Article XXII).	SDR的创立伴随着一项承诺，并写入了IMF协定章程中 ： “ 让特别提款权成为国际货币体系的主要储备资产 ” （ 第八条第7款和第二十二条 ） 。
But this commitment has remained a dead letter, except for periodic emissions of SDRs during crises, including the equivalent of $250 billion in 2009.	但这一承诺至今形同虚设，SDR只是在危机爆发时发放过几次，包括2009年所发放的相当于2500亿美元的SDR。
The IMF Articles of Agreement should be amended to allow more flexible use of SDRs, replicating the way central banks operate.	IMF协定章程应该作出修订以允许更灵活地使用SDR，复制中央银行的操作方式。
That is, SDRs could be created during global recessions and withdrawn during booms.	也就是说，SDR应该在全球衰退期间创造，在全球繁荣期间收回。
They should be the major source of IMF financing as well, replacing quota subscriptions or lending to the Fund by member countries (potentially making the IMF a purely SDR-based institution, as proposed decades ago by the late IMF economist Jacques Polak).	SDR还应该成为IMF的主要资源，取代成员国的配额认购和IMF贷款（这有望使IMF成为纯粹的基于SDR的机构，如同已故的IMF经济学家波拉克（Jacques Polak）几十年前所建议的那样 ） 。
The simplest approach would be for countries to “deposit” the SDRs that they receive at the IMF, which could then lend them to countries and invest the remainder in sovereign bonds.	最简单的方法是各国将它们得到的SDR“储蓄”在IMF，IMF将这些SDR贷给各国并将剩下部分投资于主权债券。
This should be combined with a more active role for the IMF – rather than the G-20 – as the true instrument of global macroeconomic policy coordination.	此外，IMF — — 而不是G-20 — — 应该扮演更积极的角色，成为真正的全球宏观经济政策协调工具。
One essential (and generally agreed) goal of such coordination should be to reduce global imbalances like those caused in recent years by the European Union’s rising external surplus, which has forced many emerging economies to run growing deficits.	一个根本性（也被广泛接受的）协调目标应是减少类似于近几年来因欧盟外部盈余增加从而迫使许多新兴经济体赤字抬头而造成的失衡。
Because other global currencies – the dollar, the euro, and increasingly the renminbi – would continue to coexist with the SDRs as global reserve assets, another essential element of global macroeconomic cooperation should be defining the particular obligations of countries (or regions) issuing reserve currencies.	由于其他全球货币 — — 美元、欧元，人民币也日渐跻身其中 — — 将继续与SDR共存作为全球储备资产，因此，另一个全球宏观经济合作的根本性要素应该是定义发行储备货币的各国（或各地区）的具体义务。
Still another element of international monetary reform is better management of the global exchange-rate system (or, again, “non-system”), which should aim at avoiding currency “manipulation” – but only after defining precisely what that means.	国际货币改革的另一项要素是更好地管理全球汇率体系（或者说也是“无体系 ” ） ，此项改革的目标应该是避免货币“操纵 ” — —但必须明确定义什么是操纵。
It should also reduce the high levels of exchange-rate volatility – “a tax on international specialization,” as the economist Charles Kindleberger once put it – that we have seen in recent years, including among major currencies.	改革还应该降低近几年来出现的剧烈的汇率波动水平 — — 经济学家金德尔伯格（Charles Kindleberger）称之为“国际专业化税 ” — —包括主要货币对在内。
Long-term global-finance discussions have also made clear that, under certain conditions, regulation of capital flows (“capital-flow management measures,” in current IMF terminology) are warranted on “macroprudential” grounds – an understanding accepted by the G-20 at its 2011 Cannes meeting and by the IMF last year.	长期全球金融讨论还明确地表明，在一定条件下，资本流监管（用当前IMF术语讲，叫“资本流管理措施 ” ） 必须有“宏观审慎”基础，这一点在2011年的G-20戛纳峰会被接受，IMF也在去年接受了它。
Last but not least, the international monetary system requires governance reform, which includes giving a stronger voice to emerging and developing countries.	最后，国际货币体系需要治理改革，包括给予新兴和发展中国家更大的话语权。
Aside from the final adoption of the 2010 reforms and the forthcoming 2014 quota debates, the changes should include those recommended by the Stiglitz Commission, the Palais Royal Initiative, and the 2009 Committee on IMF Governance Reform headed by Trevor Manuel, among others.	除了最后采纳2010年的改革和即将到来的2014年配额争论外，还应该包括斯蒂格利茨委员会、王宫倡议和以曼努埃尔（Trevor Manuel）等人为首的2009年IMF治理改革委员会提出的变化。
One central element of these proposals is to eliminate, once and for all, the veto power of any individual country.	这些议案的一个核心要素是一劳永逸地取消任何单个国家的否决权。
With the world waiting anxiously for some of America’s political leaders to behave like adults, the cost of maintaining the current non-system has become all too obvious.	全世界正在焦急地等待美国政治领导人向成年人那样行动，维持无体系现状的成本早已一目了然了。
	
After the Dollar	美元之后
NEW YORK – It is symbolic that the recent BRICS summit in Fortaleza, Brazil, took place exactly seven decades after the Bretton Woods Conference that created the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.	纽约—最近在巴西福塔雷萨（Fortaleza）举行的金砖国家峰会具有象征意义，其召开正逢建立了国际货币进组织和世界银行的布雷顿森林会议七十周年。
The upshot of the BRICS meeting was the announcement of the New Development Bank, which will mobilize resources for infrastructure and sustainable development projects, and a Contingent Reserve Arrangement to provide liquidity through currency swaps.	金砖国家峰会的一个重要成果是宣布成立新开发银行为基础设施和可持续发展工程动员资源，以及建立一个应急储备安排（Contingent Reserve Arrangement）以通过货币互换提供流动性。
The Bretton Woods Conference marked one of history’s greatest examples of international economic cooperation.	布雷顿森林会议是历史上国际经济合作最伟大的范例之一。
And, while no one can say yet whether the BRICS’ initiatives will succeed, they represent a major challenge to the Bretton Woods institutions, which should respond.	而尽管没人能说金砖国家的最近举动能够成功，但它们构成了对布雷顿森林机构的重大挑战，后者应该有所回应。
Rethinking the role of the US dollar in the international monetary system is a case in point.	反思美元在国际货币体系中的作用是其中的应有之义。
One key feature of the Bretton Woods system was that countries would tie their exchange rates to the US dollar.	布雷顿森林体系的一个关键特征是各国将汇率与美元绑定。
While the system was effectively eliminated in 1971, the US dollar’s central role in the international monetary system has remained intact – a reality that many countries are increasingly unwilling to accept.	尽管该体系在1971年已事实解体，但美元在国际货币体系中的核心地位并未受到动摇 — — 许多国家日益不愿接受这一现实。
Dissatisfaction with the dollar’s role as the dominant global reserve currency is not new.	不满于美元首要全球储备货币地位并非新鲜事。
In the 1960s, French Finance Minister Valéry Giscard d’Estaing famously condemned the “exorbitant privilege” that the dollar’s status bestowed upon the United States.	20世纪60年代，法国财政部长德斯坦（Valéry Giscard d’Estaing）就有过著名的批评，他称美元的地位让美国拥有了“过度特权 ” 。
The issue is not merely one of fairness.	这一问题并不只是公平问题。
According to the Belgian economist Robert Triffin, an international monetary system based on a national currency is inherently unstable, owing to the resulting tensions among the inevitably divergent interests of the issuing country and the international system as a whole.	根据比利时经济学家特里芬（Robert Triffin）的理论，基于国家货币的国际货币体系具有内在不稳定性，因为这必然会导致货币发行国利益于国际体系整体利益的冲突。
Triffin issued his warning more than 50 years ago, but it has recently gained traction, as China’s rise has made the world increasingly disinclined to tolerate the instability caused by a dollar-denominated system.	特里芬在50多年前就提出了这一警告，但直到最近才获得重视，中国的崛起让世界越来越不愿意忍受美元计价体系带来的不稳定性。
The solution, however, lies not in replacing the dollar with the renminbi, but in strengthening the role of the world’s only truly global currency: the IMF’s Special Drawing Rights.	但是，解决方案并不在于用人民币取代美元，而在于强化世界唯一的全球货币 — — IMF的特别提款权（Special Drawing Rights，SDR）的作用。
Following the creation of SDRs in 1969, IMF members committed to make them “the principle reserve asset in the international monetary system,” as stated in the Articles of Agreement.	SDR建立于1969年，IMF成员国承诺让SDR成为“国际货币体系的主要储备资产 ” ， 这一点写入了IMF章程。
But the peculiar way in which SDRs were adopted limited their usefulness.	但SDR的特殊实施方式限制了它的用途。
For starters, the separation of the IMF’s SDR account from its general account made it impossible to use SDRs to finance IMF lending.	首先，IMF的SDR与其总账是隔离的，这意味着SDR不能用于为IMF贷款提供资金。
Furthermore, though countries accrue interest on their holdings of SDRs, they have to pay interest on the allocations they receive.	此外，尽管各国所持有的SDR都能获得利息，但也必须为得到的配额支付利息。
In other words, SDRs are both an asset and a liability, functioning like a guaranteed credit line for the holder – a sort of unconditional overdraft facility.	换句话说，SDR既是资产也是负债，起作用就像是持有者所获得的信用配额保证 — — 一种无条件的透支便利。
Nonetheless, SDRs have proved to be useful.	尽管如此，SDR仍起着作用。
After initial allocations in 1970-1972, more were issued to increase global liquidity during major international crises: in 1979-1981, in 1997, and, in particular, in 2009, when the largest issue – the equivalent of $250 billion – was made.	1970—1972年首次分配后又多次在主要国际危机期间增发以提高全球流动性：1979—1981年、1997年、2009年莫不如此，特别是2009年，增发量高达2,500亿美元。
While developed countries, including the US and the United Kingdom, have drawn on their allocations, the major users have been developing and, in particular, low-income countries.	尽管美国和英国等发达国家已充分利用了它们的配额，但主要使用者一直是发展中特别是低收入国家。
In fact, this is the only way in which developing countries (China aside) share in the creation of international money.	事实上，这是发展中国家（中国除外）唯一的参与国际货币创造的方式。
Several estimates indicate that, given the additional demand for reserves, the world could absorb annual allocations of $200-300 billion or even more.	一些测算表明，考虑到对储备的新增需求，世界每年可以吸收2,000—3,000亿美元甚至更多的配额。
This has prompted many – including People’s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan; the United Nations-backed Stiglitz Commission; the Palais-Royal Initiative, led by former IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus; and the Triffin International Foundation – to call for changes to the international monetary system.	这促使许多人呼吁改变国际货币体系，包括中国人民银行行长周小川、联合国支持的斯蒂格利茨委员会（Stiglitz Commission ） 、 前IMF总裁康德苏（Michel Camdessus）领衔的皇宫倡议（Palais Royal Initiative）和特里芬国际基金会（Triffin International Foundation）等。
In 1979, the IMF economist Jacques Polak, who had been part of the Dutch delegation at the Bretton Woods conference, outlined a plan for doing just that.	1979年，IMF经济学家波拉克（Jacques Polak，他是布雷顿森林会议荷兰代表团成员）就提出了一项这样做的计划。
His recommendations include, first and foremost, making all of the IMF’s operations in SDRs, which would require ending the separation of the IMF’s SDR and general accounts.	他的计划中最重要的内容是让IMF的所有操作都通过SDR进行，这要求结束将SDR与IMF总账分离的做法。
The simplest way to fulfill this vision would be to allocate SDRs as a full reserve asset, which countries could either use or deposit in their IMF accounts.	实现这一目标的最简单的办法是将SDR作为完全储备资产进行配置，各国可以使用它，也可以将它存在自己的IMF账户中。
The IMF would use those deposits to finance its lending operations, rather than having to rely on quota allocations or “arrangements to borrow” from members.	IMF将使用这些存款为其贷款项目提供资金，而不是依靠配额分配或来自成员国的“借贷安排 ” 。
Other provisions could be added.	还可以加入其他内容。
To address developing countries’ high currency demands, while enhancing their role in the creation of international money, a formula could be created to give them a larger share in SDR allocations than they now receive.	要满足发展中国家高企的货币需求，同时强化他们在国际货币创造中的作用，可以创造一套模式让它们获得比现在所得到的更大的SDR配额比例。
The private use of SDRs could also be encouraged, though that would likely be met with strong opposition from countries currently issuing international reserve currencies, especially the US.	SDR的私人用途也可以鼓励，尽管可能受到当前国际货币储备发行国特别是美国的反对。
Keeping SDRs as pure “central-bank money” would eliminate such opposition, enabling them to complement and stabilize the current system, rather than upend it.	将SDR作为纯粹的“央行货币”能消除这一番队，让SDR完胜和稳定当前体系而不是动摇它。
Just as the Bretton Woods framework restored order to the global economy after WWII, a new monetary framework, underpinned by a truly international currency, could strengthen much-needed economic and financial stability.	正如布雷顿森林框架在二战后重建了国际经济秩序，以真正的国际货币为基础的新的货币安排能够强化当前所急需的经济和金融稳定。
Everyone – even the US – would benefit from that.	所有人 — — 包括美国 — — 都能从中获益。
	
Waste Not, Want Not	无浪费，无欲求
ROME – Every year, we waste or lose 1.3 billion metric tons of food – one-third of the world’s annual food production.	罗马—我们每年要浪费13亿吨的粮食 — — 相当于世界粮食年产量的三分之一。
The sheer scale of the number makes it almost impossible to grasp, no matter how one approaches it.	这个规模之大是很难想象的，不管你用什么方法。
Try to imagine 143,000 Eiffel Towers stacked one on top of another, or a pile of 10 trillion bananas.	你可以试想143 000座彼此重叠的埃菲尔铁塔，或者10万亿根香蕉组成的大堆。
The figure is all the more unfathomable, given that, alongside this massive wastage and loss, 840 million people experience chronic hunger on a daily basis.	还有更加难以想象的数字。 在如此大规模浪费和损失的情况下，仍有8.4亿人经历着长期的每日饥饿。
Many millions more suffer from “silent hunger” – malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies.	更有千百万人遭受着“静默的饥饿 ” — —营养不良和微量元素缺乏。
For the more economically minded, here is another number: food wastage and loss, expressed in producer prices, costs roughly $750 billion per year.	从经济上看，还有另外一个数字：用生产者价格计算，粮食浪费和损失每年造成约7500亿美元损失。
If we were to consider retail prices and the wider impacts on the environment, including climate change, the figure would be much higher.	如果我们把零售价格和更广泛的环境冲击（如气候变化）考虑在内，这个数字还要大得多。
In an era of austerity, it is difficult to understand how such a massive hemorrhage of resources could be neglected.	在紧缩年代，很难理解如此大规模的资源渗漏会被忽视。
In fact, in some places, the volume of food wastage is rising.	事实上，在一些地区，粮食浪费量还在增长。
Now a new report by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization focuses on another troubling aspect of the problem: the negative consequences for the environment and the natural resources on which we rely for our survival.	眼下，联合国粮农组织的一份最新报告关注了这一问题的另一个棘手方面：对我们所赖以生存的环境和自然资源所造成的消极后果。
When food is lost or wasted, the energy, land, and water resources that went into producing it are squandered as well.	当粮食损失或被浪费时，生产粮食所投入的能源、土地和水资源也随之东流了。
At the same time, large amounts of greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere during production, processing, and cooking.	与此同时，在生产、加工和烹饪过程中有大量温室气体排入���气。
From any perspective – ethical, economic, environmental, or in terms of food security – we simply cannot tolerate the annual wastage of 1.3 billion tons of food.	从伦理、经济、环境以及粮食安全等诸多角度看，我们绝对不能容忍每年浪费13亿吨粮食。
This is why serious reduction of food loss and wastage is one of the five elements of UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s “Zero Hunger Challenge” and a major focus of the UN High Level Task Force on Global Food Security.	大幅减少粮食损失和浪费成为联合国秘书长潘基文的“零饥饿挑战 ” （ Zero Hunger Challenge）的五大要素之一以及联合国高级别全球粮食安全工作组（UN High Level Task Force on Global Food Security）的主要关注点之一，原因就在于此。
We are working together within the UN system and with a broad coalition of other partners to ensure universal access to adequate food all year round; eliminate childhood stunting; make all food systems sustainable; and eradicate rural poverty.	我们在联合国系统内共同合作，与其他合作伙伴组成广泛的同盟以确保人人都能全年获得充足的粮食、消灭儿童发育迟缓、让所有粮食体系变得可持续、并根除农村贫困。
Next week, the Global Green Growth Forum in Copenhagen will allow for a deeper look at this issue.	下周，哥本哈根全球绿色增长论坛（Global Green Growth Forum）将让我们根深度地检视这一问题。
There is much that can be done.	我们可以做很多事。
For starters, food loss and wastage needs to be seen as a cross-cutting policy issue, rather than a lifestyle choice to be left in the hands of individual consumers and their consciences.	首先，粮食损失和浪费需要被视为跨越性政策问题，而不只是个人消费者及其良心决定的生活方式选择问题。
The world needs to wake up to the need for policies that address all stages of the food chain, from production to consumption.	世界需要警醒 — — 我们需要针对包括从生产到消费的整个粮食链的所有阶段的政策。
Food loss – on farms, during processing, transport, and at markets – undermines food security in most developing countries, where post-harvest losses can reach as high as 40% of production.	粮食损失 — — 在地头、在加工过程中、在运输期间、在市场交易中 — — 威胁着大部分发展中国家的粮食安全，收获后损失可能高达产量的40 % 。
Investment in infrastructure for transport, storage, and marketing of food is badly needed, as are programs to train farmers in best practices.	粮食运输、存储和营销方面的基础设施投资严重不足，农民也急需培训以了解最佳行动方式。
In developed countries, food-retailing practices require a rethink.	在发达国家，粮食零售行为也需要反思。
For example, rejection of food products on the basis of aesthetic concerns is a major cause of wastage.	比如，因审美观念而拒绝粮食生产是极大的浪费源。
Some supermarkets have already begun relaxing standards on fruit appearance, selling “misshapen” items at reduced prices and helping to raise awareness that ugly does not mean bad.	一些超级市场已开始放松对水果外观的标准，以折扣价售卖“畸形”水果，这有助于让人们了解丑并不意味着差。
More approaches like this – and concerted efforts to find markets or uses for surplus food – are needed.	我们需要更多的类似行为以及共同寻找剩余粮食的市场和用途。
Businesses and households alike should monitor where and how they waste food and take corrective steps, because prevention of wastage is even more important than recycling or composting.	企业和家庭应该监控他们在哪些环节浪费了那些粮食，并采取矫正措施，因为预防浪费甚至比回收或堆肥更重要。
Yes, 1.3 billion tons is a mindboggling figure.	是的，13亿吨是一个令人咋舌的数字。
But these simple steps are easy enough to grasp – and within reach for everyone.	但这些简单措施很容易掌握，并且人人可以做到。
The world confronts many seemingly intractable problems; food wastage is one issue that we all can do something about now.	世界面临着诸多看似棘手的问题；粮食浪费是我们可以人人做起、从现在做起的问题。
	
Argentina’s Griesafault	阿根廷的葛里萨违约
NEW YORK – On July 30, Argentina’s creditors did not receive their semiannual payment on the bonds that were restructured after the country’s last default in 2001.	纽约—7月30日，阿根廷债权人没有收到该国2001年违约后经历重组的债券的半年利息。
Argentina had deposited $539 million in the Bank of New York Mellon a few days before.	几天前，阿根廷在纽约梅隆银行（Bank of New York Mellon）存入了5.39亿美元。
But the bank could not transfer the funds to the creditors: US federal judge Thomas Griesa had ordered that Argentina could not pay the creditors who had accepted its restructuring until it fully paid – including past interest – those who had rejected it.	但该银行无法把这笔钱转给债权人：美国联邦法官葛里萨（Thomas Griesa）判决，在连本带息足额偿付拒绝重组的债权人之前，阿根廷不能偿付接受重组的债权人。
It was the first time in history that a country was willing and able to pay its creditors, but was blocked by a judge from doing so.	这是历史上第一次由国家愿意也有能力支付债权人，却被法官阻挠。
The media called it a default by Argentina, but the Twitter hashtag #Griesafault was much more accurate.	媒体称之为阿根廷违约，但Twitter标签更加正确 — — “葛里萨违约 ” （ #Griesafault ） 。
Argentina has fulfilled its obligations to its citizens and to the creditors who accepted its restructuring.	阿根廷履行了其对国民和接受重组的债权人的义务。
Griesa’s ruling, however, encourages usurious behavior, threatens the functioning of international financial markets, and defies a basic tenet of modern capitalism: insolvent debtors need a fresh start.	但葛里萨的裁决却在鼓励高利贷行为，威胁了国际金融市场的运行，也践踏了现代资本主义的一条基本原则：资不抵债的债务人需要从新开始。
Sovereign defaults are common events with many causes.	主权违约是一个常见现象，原因多种多样。
For Argentina, the path to its 2001 default started with the ballooning of its sovereign debt in the 1990s, which occurred alongside neoliberal “Washington Consensus” economic reforms that creditors believed would enrich the country.	就阿根廷而言，2001年的违约起因是20世纪90年代积累了太多的主权债务，而这又是拜“华盛顿共识”所赐。 债权人相信，新自由主义的华盛顿共识经济改革能让阿根廷走向富裕。
The experiment failed, and the country suffered a deep economic and social crisis, with a recession that lasted from 1998 to 2002.	这场实验以失败告终，阿根廷也经历了深刻的经济和社会危机，衰退从1998年一直持续到2002年。
By the end, a record-high 57.5% of Argentinians were in poverty, and the unemployment rate skyrocketed to 20.8%.	最终，创纪录的57.5%的阿根廷人陷入贫困，失业率也一飞冲天，达到了20.8 % 。
Argentina restructured its debt in two rounds of negotiations, in 2005 and 2010.	阿根廷通过两轮谈判（2005年和2010年）重组了债务。
More than 92% of creditors accepted the new deal, and received exchanged bonds and GDP-indexed bonds.	92%的债权人接受了新协议，并获得了与GDP挂钩的替换债券。
It worked out well for both Argentina and those who accepted the restructuring.	对阿根廷和接受重组的债权人来说，这一新协议相当成功。
The economy soared, so the GDP-indexed bonds paid off handsomely.	阿根廷经济实现了腾飞，GDP挂钩债券的偿付情况也非常不错。
But so-called vulture investors saw an opportunity to make even larger profits.	但所谓的兀鹫投资者看到了攫取更大利润的机会。
The vultures were neither long-term investors in Argentina nor the optimists who believed that Washington Consensus policies would work.	这些“兀鹫”既非阿根廷长期投资者，亦非认为华盛顿共识能够奏效的乐观派。
They were simply speculators who swooped in after the 2001 default and bought up bonds for a fraction of their face value from panicky investors.	他们无非是投机客，在2001年违约时猛冲下来，以面值的几分之一从恐慌的投资者手中收购债券。
They then sued Argentina to obtain 100% of that value.	然后，他们把阿根廷告上法庭，要求获得100%的债券价值。
NML Capital, a subsidiary of the hedge fund Elliot Management, headed by Paul Singer, spent $48 million on bonds in 2008; thanks to Griesa’s ruling, NML Capital should now receive $832 million – a return of more than 1,600%.	对冲基金艾略特管理公司（Elliot Management）旗下的NML资本公司在保罗·辛格（Paul Singer）的带领下于2008年花了4,800万美元购买这些债券；根据葛里萨的裁决，NML资本公司现在应该获得8.32亿美元 — — 回报超过1,600 % 。
The figures are so high in part because the vultures seek to earn past interest, which, for some securities, includes a country-risk premium – the higher interest rate offered when they were issued to offset the larger perceived probability of default.	如此高的回报部分是因为兀鹫投资者要求获得过去的利息，而对一些证券来说，其中需要包含国家风险溢价 — — 当违约概率较高时，债券发行就必须提供更高的利率作为补偿。
Griesa found that this was reasonable.	葛里萨认为这是合理的。
Economically, though, it makes no sense.	但是，从经济上讲，这毫无意义。
When a country pays a risk premium on its debt, it means that default is a possibility.	当一国为其债务支付风险溢价时，这意味着违约成为可能。
But if a court rules that a country always must repay the debt, there is no default risk to be compensated.	但如果法庭裁决一国永远必须偿付债务，就不存在需要补偿的违约风险。
Repayment on Griesa’s terms would devastate Argentina’s economy.	根据葛里萨的要求实行偿付会毁掉阿根廷经济。
NML Capital and the other vultures comprise just 1% of the creditors, but would receive a total of $1.5 billion.	MNL资本公司和其他兀鹫投资者只占债权人的1 % ， 但总共可以获得15亿美元。
Other holdouts (6.6% of total creditors) would receive $15 billion.	其他坚持抵制的债权人（占债权人数量的6.6 % ） 可以获得150亿美元。
And, because the debt restructuring stipulated that all of the creditors who accepted it could demand the same terms as holdouts receive, Argentina might be on the hook for $140 billion more.	而由于债务重组规定所有者接受方案的债权人都可以要求与坚持抵制的债权人相同的条件，因此阿根廷可能会因此多付出1,400亿美元。
Every Argentine might thus owe more than $3,500 – more than one-third of average annual per capita income.	这样一来，每个阿根廷都背上了3,500多美元的债务 — — 相当于人均收入的三分之一以上。
In the United States, applying the equivalent proportion would mean forcing every citizen to pay roughly $20,000 – all to line the pockets of some billionaires, intent on wringing the country dry.	若是在美国，这相当于强迫每位公民付出约20,000美元，而这笔钱几乎全部流入了少数企图榨干这个国家的亿万富翁的腰包。
What’s more, the existence of credit default swaps creates the possibility of further gains for the vultures.	不仅如此，信用违约互换（CDS）的存在使得兀鹫投资者还有进一步获利的可能。
A CDS insures against a default, paying off if the bonds do not. They can yield substantial returns, regardless of whether the bonds are repaid – thus reducing their holders’ incentive to achieve an agreement.	CDS相当于违约保险，在债券无法偿付时赔偿持有人，它可以产生巨大的回报，不管债券是否被偿付 — — 从而刺激持有人达成协议。
In the run-up to July 30, the vultures conducted a scare campaign.	7月30日，兀鹫投资者发动了一场恐吓行动。
A second default in 13 years would be a big setback for Argentina, they claimed, threatening the country’s fragile economy.	他们说，13年后的第二次违约将是阿根廷的一次重大退步，威胁到脆弱的国家经济。
But all of this presumed that financial markets would not distinguish between a default and a Griesafault.	但他们的论断有一个前提：金融市场无法区分违约和葛里萨违约。
Fortunately, they did: Interest rates for different categories of Argentine corporate loans have not reacted to the event.	幸运的是，金融市场有这个能力：不同类型的阿根廷公司贷款的利率并未对此事件产生反应。
In fact, borrowing costs on July 30 were lower than the average for the whole year.	事实上，7月30日的借贷成本低于全年平均水平。
Ultimately, though, the Griesafault will carry a high price – less for Argentina than for the global economy and countries needing access to foreign financing.	但是，最终葛里萨违约会带来高昂代价 — — 相对于阿根廷，全球经济和需要外国融资的国家受影响更大。
America will suffer, too.	美国也会蒙受损失。
Its courts have been a travesty: As one observer pointed out,it was clear that Griesa never really fathomed the issue’s complexity.	美国法院已经成了嘲弄对象。 一位观察家指出，显然葛里萨根本不明白此事的复杂性。
The US financial system, already practiced at exploiting poor Americans, has extended its efforts globally.	大肆掠夺美国穷人的美国金融体系要把触手伸向全球。
Sovereign borrowers will not – and should not – trust the fairness and competence of the US judiciary.	主权债务人不会 — — 也不应该 — — 相信美国司法的公平和胜任能力了。
The market for issuance of such bonds will move elsewhere.	这些债券的发行市场会转向别处。
	
Debeaking the Vultures	切掉兀鹫之喙
NEW YORK – In the midst of the ongoing dispute between Argentina and the “vulture funds” that hold its bonds, a broad consensus has emerged concerning the need for sovereign-debt restructuring mechanisms (SDRMs).	纽约—在阿根廷与持有其债券的“兀鹫基金”之间闹得不可开交之际，一个共识已经浮现：我们需要主权债务重组机制（SDRM ） 。
Otherwise, US Federal Judge Thomas P. Griesa’s ruling that Argentina must pay the vultures in full (after 93% of other bondholders agreed to a restructuring) will give free rein to opportunistic behaviors that sabotage future restructurings.	否则，美国联邦法官托马斯·葛里萨（Thomas P. Griesa）的裁决 — — 阿根廷必须足额偿付兀鹫（尽管93%的其他债券持有者同意重组 ） — —将让机会主义者肆无忌惮地阻挠未来重组。
Most recently, the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) recommended new terms for government bonds.	最近，国际资本市场协会（International Capital Market Association，ICMA）建议对政府债券采取新条款。
Though the ICMA’s proposal leaves unresolved the hundreds of billions of bonds written under the old terms, the new framework says in effect that Griesa’s interpretation was wrong, and recognizes that leaving it in place would make restructuring impossible.	尽管ICMA的建议保留了数千亿已发行债券的旧条款，但新框架事实上宣判了葛里萨的裁决是错误的，并认为让该裁决继续存在下去将让重组无从进行。
The ICMA’s proposed contractual terms clarify the pari passu clause that was at the heart of Griesa’s muddle-headed ruling.	ICMA所建议的合约条款明确了作为葛里萨糊涂裁决核心的平等权利条款。
The intent of the clause – a standard component of sovereign-bond contracts – was always to ensure that the issuing country treated identical bondholders identically.	该条款是主权债券合约的标准组成部分，其初衷总是为了确保发行无差别地对待相同的债券持有人。
But it has always been recognized that senior creditors – for example, the International Monetary Fund – are treated differently.	但人们总是认为高级债权人 — — 比如国际货币基金组织（IMF）能受到区别对待。
Griesa did not seem to grasp the common understanding of the clause.	葛里萨似乎没有抓住对该条款的普遍理解。
After Argentina defaulted on its sovereign debt in 2001, vulture funds bought defaulted bonds in the secondary market at a fraction of their face value, and then sued for full payment.	在2001年阿根廷对其主权债务违约后，兀鹫基金在二级市场以面值的几分之一买入违约的债券，然后起诉要求足额偿付。
According to Griesa’s interpretation of pari passu, if Argentina paid the interest that it owed to creditors that accepted the restructuring, it had to pay the vultures in full – including all past interest and the principal.	根据葛里萨对权利平等条款的解释，如果阿根廷向接受重组的债券人偿付利息，就必须足额偿付兀鹫 — — 包括之前的所有本息。
The vultures’ business was enabled in part by litigation over the so-called champerty defense – based on a longstanding English common-law doctrine, later adopted by US state legislatures, prohibiting the purchase of debt with the intent of bringing a lawsuit.	兀鹫之所以能如此行事，部分是拜所谓的帮诉辩护（champerty defense）诉讼所赐 — — 其基础是由来已久的英国普通法概念，随后被美国州立法机关所采纳，禁止以打官司为目的购买债券。
Argentina is simply the latest victim in the vultures’ long legal battle to change the rules of the game to permit them to prey on poor countries seeking to restructure their debts.	阿根廷只是最新的受害者 — — 长期以来，兀鹫一直在进行法律斗争改变游戏规则，以使他们能掠食试图重组债务的穷国。
In 1999, in Elliot Associates, LP v. Banco de la Nacion and the Republic of Peru, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals determined that the plaintiff’s intent in purchasing the discounted debt was to be paid in full or otherwise to sue.	1999年，在艾略特联合工作四诉秘鲁共和国国民银行案（Elliot Associates, LP v. Banco de la Nacion and the Republic of Peru）中，第二巡回上诉法院裁决原告购买折价债务的意图是为了获得足额偿付，否则原告就会上诉。
The court then ruled that Elliot’s intent, because it was contingent, did not meet the champerty requirement.	因此，法院裁定艾略特公司的意图 — — 因其具有或有性 — — 不符合帮诉条件。
Though some other courts accepted the Second Circuit’s narrow reading of the champerty defense, the vultures were not satisfied and went to the New York state legislature, which in 2004 effectively eliminated the defense of champerty concerning any debt purchase above $500,000.	尽管其他一些法院接受了第二巡回法院关于帮诉辩护的狭义解读，但兀鹫并没有就此满足，而是来到纽约州立法机关。 2004年，纽约州立法机关事实上取消了金额超过500,000美元的所有债务购买行为的帮诉辩护。
That decision contradicted understandings according to which hundreds of billions of dollars of debt had already been issued.	这一决定有悖于数千亿美元已发行债务所根据的理解。
Investors who acquire defaulted sovereign debt at huge discounts should not expect repayment in full; the discount is an indication that the market does not expect that, and it is only through litigation that one could hope to receive anything close to it.	以巨大折价买入违约主权债务投资者不应该期待足额偿付；折价已经表明市场并不期待能够如此，只有诉讼才有可能让投资者接近这一目标。
An important change in the legal framework, such as the elimination of the champerty defense, is de facto a change in “property rights,” with the debtors losing, and creditors who purchase the bonds intending to sue if they are not paid what they want – the vultures – gaining.	法律框架的重要变化，比如取消帮诉辩护，实际上是一种“产权”变化，债务人受损，购买债券以便为了得不到想要的偿付时起诉的债权人 — — 即兀鹫 — — 获益。
The vultures were thus unjustly enriched, doubly so with the novel and unjustified interpretation of the pari passu clause.	因此，兀鹫大发不义之财，因为对平等权利条款的不公平的“奇葩”解释让利润翻番。
Will so-called collective-action clauses (CACs) – another aspect of the ICMA “reform” aimed at debeaking the vultures – save the day?	所谓的集体行动条款（collective-action clauses ） — —ICMA旨在打击兀鹫的“改革”的另一个重要方面 — — 能力挽狂澜吗？
In many countries, CACs stipulate that if, say, two-thirds of the investors accept a company’s (or a country’s) restructuring proposal, the other investors are bound to go along.	在许多国家，集体行动条款规定，如果（比如）三分之二的投资者接受某公司（或某国）的重组方案，其他投资者也必须遵守。
This mechanism prevents speculative holdouts from holding up the restructuring process and demanding ransom.	该机制阻止了投机性强硬派劫持重组程序、要求赎回。
But CACs do not exist for sovereign debt written in many jurisdictions, leaving the field open for the vultures.	但很多司法辖区所发行的主权债务中不含集体行动条款，这给兀鹫的行动创造了条件。
Moreover, CACs are no panacea.	此外，集体行动条款也不是万灵丹。
If they were, there would be no need for domestic bankruptcy law, which spells out issues like precedence and fair treatment.	如果是的话，就不需要国内破产法了，破产法的存在就是为了避免效仿先例和公平对待。
But no government has found CACs adequate for resolving domestic restructuring.	但没有一个政府发现集体行动条款已足以解决国内重组。
So why should we think that they would suffice in the much more complex world of sovereign-debt restructurings?	既然如此，我们又怎么能认为它们能胜任于复杂得多的主权债务重组问题呢？
In particular, CACs suffer from the problem of “aggregation.”	特别是，集体行动条款受“加总”问题的困扰。
If a CAC required, say, 75% of the holders of each bond class, vultures could buy 26% of only one bond class and block the entire restructuring.	如果集体行动条款要求（比如）每种债券级别都有75%多数的持有者，那么兀鹫只要买入一种债券类别的26 % ， 就可以阻挠整个重组。
The recent Greek debt restructuring had to confront this issue.	最近的希腊债务重组就不得不面临这一问题。
The ICMA’s new framework seems to provide a way out: The supermajority would be defined by the acceptance of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities of all of the affected series.	ICMA的新框架似乎提供了解决之道：绝对多数由所有受影响序列的未偿还债务政权的总本金数量决定。
The supermajority’s decisions would be binding on all other investors.	所有其他投资者都必须遵守绝对多数的决定。
But this, too, poses a problem: The more junior creditors could vote to have themselves treated in the same way as more senior creditors.	但这也存在一个问题：多数低级债权人可以投票使自己获得与多数高级债权人同样的地位。
What recourse would the senior creditors then have?	那么，高级债权人能获得什么索偿权呢？
In bankruptcy court, they would have grounds for objecting, and the judge would have to weigh the equities.	在破产法庭，他们有反对权，法官将根据他们的要求权衡。
These issues are especially important in the context of sovereign-debt restructurings, because the claimants to a country’s resources include not only formal creditors; others, too – for example, pensioners – might not be paid if bondholders are paid in full.	这些问题在主权债务重组中特别重要，因为对某国的索偿权的主张者不但包括正式债权人；如果债券持有人获得足额偿付，其他人 — — 比如退休者 — — 也可能无法获得偿付。
Chapter 9 of the US Bankruptcy Code (which applies to public entities) recognizes these rights – unlike Griesa and the vultures.	美国破产法第九章（适用于公共实体）承认这些权利 — — 这与葛里萨和兀鹫不同。
Today, the international community faces two challenges.	如今，国际社会面临两大挑战。
One is to deal with the hundreds of billions of dollars of debt written under the old terms, which cannot be restructured under Griesa’s ruling.	一是处置根据旧条款发行的数千亿美元债务，它们无法根据葛里萨的裁决重组。
The second is to decide on the terms that should be imposed in the future.	二是决定应在未来采用的条款。
The investing community has made a serious proposal.	投资界提出了严肃的方案。
But changes of this magnitude must be based on discussions among creditors and debtor governments – and more is needed than tweaking the terms of the agreements.	但这种程度的变化必须基于债权人和债务人政府之间的讨论 — — 也不是光在协议条款问题上扯皮就行的。
An initiative at the United Nations to encourage the establishment of SDRMs is receiving the support of prominent academic economists and practitioners.	联合国鼓励建立主权债务重组机制的计划受到了著名经济学者和实践家的支持。
Global efforts are good first steps to remedy the damage to international financial markets that the US courts have inflicted.	全球努力是弥补美国法院所造成的国际金融市场伤害的可喜的第一步。
For the sake of a healthy global economy, the vultures must be grounded.	为了全球经济的健康，不能放纵兀鹫肆虐。
	
Stagnation by Design	人造停滞
NEW YORK – Soon after the global financial crisis erupted in 2008, I warned that unless the right policies were adopted, Japanese-style malaise – slow growth and near-stagnant incomes for years to come – could set in.	纽约—2008年，全球金融危机爆发不久，我警告说除非采取正确的政策，否则将会出现日本式问题 — — 多年的经济增长缓慢和收入近乎停滞。
While leaders on both sides of the Atlantic claimed that they had learned the lessons of Japan, they promptly proceeded to repeat some of the same mistakes.	尽管大西洋两岸的领导人纷纷表示已经吸取了日本的教训，但他们仍在积极地重复相同的错误。
Now, even a key former United States official, the economist Larry Summers, is warning of secular stagnation.	如今，甚至前美国高级官员、经济学家萨默斯（Larry Summers）也在警告长期停滞。
The basic point that I raised a half-decade ago was that, in a fundamental sense, the US economy was sick even before the crisis: it was only an asset-price bubble, created through lax regulation and low interest rates, that had made the economy seem robust.	我在五年前所提出的的基本要点是，从根本上说，美国经济在危机之前便已出现问题：它只是一个被宽松的监管和低利率资产价格泡沫，经济只是看起来强健。
Beneath the surface, numerous problems were festering: growing inequality; an unmet need for structural reform (moving from a manufacturing-based economy to services and adapting to changing global comparative advantages); persistent global imbalances; and a financial system more attuned to speculating than to making investments that would create jobs, increase productivity, and redeploy surpluses to maximize social returns.	在表面之下，诸多问题正在发酵：不平等性日益增加、结构性改革（从基于制造业的经济转向服务业并适应全球比较优势的变化）的需要得不到满足、持续的全球失衡；以及金融系统更习惯于投机而不是创造就业岗位、提高生产率和利用盈余实现社会回报最大化的投资。
Policymakers’ response to the crisis failed to address these issues; worse, it exacerbated some of them and created new ones – and not just in the US.	决策者对危机的反应并没有纠正这些问题；更糟糕的是，反而加剧了其中一些问题并创造了新的问题 — — 不仅美国是如此。
The result has been increased indebtedness in many countries, as the collapse of GDP undermined government revenues.	结果是随着GDP暴降影响了政府岁入，许多国家负债水平增加。
Moreover, underinvestment in both the public and private sector has created a generation of young people who have spent years idle and increasingly alienated at a point in their lives when they should have been honing their skills and increasing their productivity.	此外，公共和私人部门的投资不足让一代年轻人在应该打磨技能、提高生产率的时期荒废并日益疏远着。
On both sides of the Atlantic, GDP is likely to grow considerably faster this year than in 2013.	在大西洋两岸，今年GDP增长有望大大快于2013年。
But, before leaders who embraced austerity policies open the champagne and toast themselves, they should examine where we are and consider the near-irreparable damage that these policies have caused.	但是，在采取紧缩政策领导人开香槟庆祝之前，他们应该考察一下我们的现状并看看这些政策所导致的几乎不可挽回的伤害。
Every downturn eventually comes to an end.	任何衰退终究有结束的一天。
The mark of a good policy is that it succeeds in making the downturn shallower and shorter than it otherwise would have been.	好政策的标志是它能让衰退期变得更浅、更短。
The mark of the austerity policies that many governments embraced is that they made the downturn far deeper and longer than was necessary, with long-lasting consequences.	许多政府所亲爱去的紧缩政策的标志是它们让衰退变得比必要程度深得多、长得多，而且还造成了长期后果。
Real (inflation-adjusted) GDP per capita is lower in most of the North Atlantic than it was in 2007; in Greece, the economy has shrunk by an estimated 23%.	大部分北大西洋国家的实际（经通胀调整的）GDP低于2007年；在希腊，经济收缩幅度估计达到了23 % 。
Germany, the top-performing European country, has recorded miserly 0.7% average annual growth over the last six years.	表现最出色的欧洲国家德国在过去六年里年均增长率也只有0.7 % 。
The US economy is still roughly 15% smaller than it would have been had growth continued even on the moderate pre-crisis trajectory.	美国经济规模仍比增长延续危机前温和水平的情形小15 % 。
But even these numbers do not tell the full story of how bad things are, because GDP is not a good measure of success.	但这些数字也不能充分说明事情到底有多坏，因为GDP不是一个衡量成功的好指标。
Far more relevant is what is happening to household incomes.	更相关的指标是家庭收入情况。
Median real income in the US is below its level in 1989, a quarter-century ago; median income for full-time male workers is lower now than it was more than 40 years ago.	美国中位实际收入比1989年（即二十五年前）的水平还要低；全职男性员工中位收入还不如40多年前的水平。
Some, like the economist Robert Gordon, have suggested that we should adjust to a new reality in which long-term productivity growth will be significantly below what it has been over the past century.	经济学家戈登（Robert Gordon）等人指出，我们应该对新的现实做出反应 — — 长期生产率增长将远低于过去一个世纪。
Given economists’ miserable record – reflected in the run-up to the crisis – for even three-year predictions, no one should have much confidence in a crystal ball that forecasts decades into the future.	经济学家的预测向来靠不住 — — 哪怕是预测短短三年，这在此次危机过程中已经尽显无疑 — — 因此对于几十年后的未来，我们不能对水晶球抱有多大信心。
But this much seems clear: unless government policies change, we are in for a long period of disappointment.	但有一点是显而易见的：除非政府政策有所变化，否则我们将迎来长期失望。
Markets are not self-correcting.	市场不是自我纠正的。
The underlying fundamental problems that I outlined earlier could get worse – and many are.	我早前所列举的基本问题可能会进一步恶化 — — 其中许多确实恶化了。
Inequality leads to weak demand; widening inequality weakens demand even more; and, in most countries, including the US, the crisis has only worsened inequality.	不平等性让需求萎靡不振；加剧的不平等性让需求更加萎靡不振；而在包括美国在内的许多国家，危机正是恶化了不平等性。
The trade surpluses of northern Europe have increased, even as China’s have moderated.	北欧的贸易盈余有所增加，虽然中国贸易盈余有所减少。
Most important, markets have never been very good at achieving structural transformations quickly on their own; the transition from agriculture to manufacturing, for example, was anything but smooth; on the contrary, it was accompanied by significant social dislocation and the Great Depression.	最重要的是，市场从不擅长自动快速实现结构转型；比如，从农业到制造业的转型是非常不平滑的；而是伴随着巨大的社会动荡和大萧条。
This time is no different, but in some ways it could be worse: the sectors that should be growing, reflecting the needs and desires of citizens, are services like education and health, which traditionally have been publicly financed, and for good reason.	这次也不会不一样，但从某种程度上说可能更加糟糕：应该出现增长的部门 — — 因为它们反映了人民的需要和渴望 — — 是教育和健康等服务部门，在传统上，这些部门都是由公共资金支撑的，其中的道理不言自明。
But, rather than government facilitating the transition, austerity is inhibiting it.	但是，政府不但没有协助转型，还通过紧缩制约了它。
Malaise is better than a recession, and a recession is better than a depression.	停滞比衰退好，衰退又比萧条好。
But the difficulties that we are facing now are not the result of the inexorable laws of economics, to which we simply must adjust, as we would to a natural disaster, like an earthquake or tsunami.	但我们目前所面临的困难不是无情的经济定律 — — 对于经济定律，我们只能适应，就像对地震和海啸等自然灾难那样。
They are not even a kind of penance that we have to pay for past sins – though, to be sure, the neoliberal policies that have prevailed for the past three decades have much to do with our current predicament.	我们目前所面临的困境甚至也算不上因为过去的罪恶而不得不付出的苦行 — — 尽管平心而论，过去三十年所流行的新自由主义政策与当前困境关系很大。
Instead, our current difficulties are the result of flawed policies.	相反，我们当前的困难是政策缺陷带来的。
There are alternatives.	我们有不同的政策可用。
But we will not find them in the self-satisfied complacency of the elites, whose incomes and stock portfolios are once again soaring.	但在精英自我满足的自鸣得意中 — — 他们的收入和股票组合又开始飙涨了 — — 我们无法看到不同的政策。
Only some people, it seems, must adjust to a permanently lower standard of living.	看起来只有一部分人必须作出调整以适应持久的生活水平下降。
Unfortunately, those people happen to be most people.	不幸的是，这部分人正好是大部分人。
	
The Innovation Enigma	创新之谜
NEW YORK – Around the world, there is enormous enthusiasm for the type of technological innovation symbolized by Silicon Valley.	纽约—环顾世界，人们对以硅谷为象征的科技创新有着无尽的热情。
In this view, America’s ingenuity represents its true comparative advantage, which others strive to imitate.	在这些人看来，美国的聪慧代表着它的真正比较优势，其他国家都在尽力模仿。
But there is a puzzle: it is difficult to detect the benefits of this innovation in GDP statistics.	但在这里有一个迷：很难看出这种创新对GDP统计数字的贡献。
What is happening today is analogous to developments a few decades ago, early in the era of personal computers.	今天所发生的事情与几十年前个人电脑时代肇始时有几分相似。
In 1987, economist Robert Solow – awarded the Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on growth – lamented that “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.”	1987年，因在增长方面的开创性贡献而荣获诺贝尔奖的经济学家罗伯特·索洛（Robert Solow）哀叹 ： “ 电脑时代的印记随处可见，就是在生产率数据中看不到 。 ”
There are several possible explanations for this.	对于这一点，可能的原因有好几个。
Perhaps GDP does not really capture the improvements in living standards that computer-age innovation is engendering.	也许GDP并不真正能够体现电脑时代的创新所带来的生活水平的提高。
Or perhaps this innovation is less significant than its enthusiasts believe.	或者这一创新并没有热烈支持者所认为的那么意义重大。
As it turns out, there is some truth in both perspectives.	事实表明，两者兼而有之。
Recall how a few years ago, just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the financial sector prided itself on its innovativeness.	不妨回忆一下，几年前，雷曼兄弟倒闭前夕，金融部门以创新而自负。
Given that financial institutions had been attracting the best and brightest from around the world, one would have expected nothing less.	金融机构吸引着全世界最优秀、最聪明的人才，你还能期待什么呢？
But, upon closer inspection, it became clear that most of this innovation involved devising better ways of scamming others, manipulating markets without getting caught (at least for a long time), and exploiting market power.	但是，近距离的检视表明，金融创新大部分无非是更好地蒙骗他人、操纵市场而不被抓住（或者在相当长的时间里不被抓住）以及利用市场权力。
In this period, when resources flowed to this “innovative” sector, GDP growth was markedly lower than it was before.	在此期间，资源纷纷流入这一“创新”部门，而GDP增长比此前显著地降低了。
Even in the best of times, it did not lead to an increase in living standards (except for the bankers), and it eventually led to the crisis from which we are only now recovering.	即使在最佳时期，它也没有提高生活水平（银行家除外 ） ， 最终还导致了我们至今仍在尽力摆脱的危机。
The net social contribution of all of this “innovation” was negative.	这一“创新”的净社会贡献是负数。
Similarly, the dot-com bubble that preceded this period was marked by innovation – Web sites through which one could order dog food and soft drinks online.	类似地，前一次互联网泡沫也打着创新的幌子，尽是些可以让你在线订购狗粮和软饮料的网站。
At least this era left a legacy of efficient search engines and a fiber-optic infrastructure.	这次创新潮好歹还留下了管用的搜索引擎和光纤基础设施。
But it is not an easy matter to assess how the time savings implied by online shopping, or the cost savings that might result from increased competition (owing to greater ease of price comparison online), affects our standard of living.	但很难说在线购物所节省的时间，或者竞争的提高（因为上网比较价格比以前方便了很多）所节省的成本在多大程度上影响了我们的生活水平。
Two things should be clear.	有两点应该澄清。
First, the profitability of an innovation may not be a good measure of its net contribution to our standard of living.	首先，创新的盈利能力并不是衡量其对我们的生活水平的净贡献的耗指标。
In our winner-takes-all economy, an innovator who develops a better Web site for online dog-food purchases and deliveries may attract everyone around the world who uses the Internet to order dog food, making enormous profits in the process.	在赢家通吃的经济中，开发出更好的在线狗粮购买和递送网站的创新者可能把全世界所有用互联网订购狗粮的用户都吸引过去，在此过程中赚取大笔利润。
But without the delivery service, much of those profits simply would have gone to others.	但若没有递送服务，这笔利润的大部分将流入他人的腰包。
The Web site’s net contribution to economic growth may in fact be relatively small.	网站对经济增长的净贡献事实上可能相对很小。
Moreover, if an innovation, such as ATMs in banking, leads to increased unemployment, none of the social cost – neither the suffering of those who are laid off nor the increased fiscal cost of paying them unemployment benefits – is reflected in firms’ profitability.	此外，如果一项创新，如银行ATM机，增加了失业，则这一社会成本 — — 不管是被裁员者所遭遇的困难还是给他们发放失业救济增加的财政负担 — — 并不会体现在企业的盈利能力中。
Likewise, our GDP metric does not reflect the cost of the increased insecurity individuals may feel with the increased risk of a loss of a job.	类似地，我们的GDP数字也不会反映个体因丢掉工作风险增加而感受到了不安全感。
Equally important, it often does not accurately reflect the improvement in societal wellbeing resulting from innovation.	同样重要的是，它通常无法准确反映创新所带来的社会福利改善。
In a simpler world, where innovation simply meant lowering the cost of production of, say, an automobile, it was easy to assess an innovation’s value.	在更简单的世界中，创新无非意味着降低（比如汽车的）生产成本，评估创新的价值就比较容易。
But when innovation affects an automobile’s quality, the task becomes far more difficult.	但如若创新影响的是汽车的质量，则评估其价值就比较困难了。
And this is even more apparent in other arenas: How do we accurately assess the fact that, owing to medical progress, heart surgery is more likely to be successful now than in the past, leading to a significant increase in life expectancy and quality of life?	其他领域就更加如此了：我们如何准确地评现在估心脏手术因为医学进步而比过去增加的成功率，从而极大地增加了寿命预期、改善了生命质量这一事实？
Still, one cannot avoid the uneasy feeling that, when all is said and done, the contribution of recent technological innovations to long-term growth in living standards may be substantially less than the enthusiasts claim.	但是，你无法摆脱一种不安感，即，当一切都说到做尽时，最新的科技创新对长期生活水平增长的贡献可能远远不如拥趸所宣称的。
A lot of intellectual effort has been devoted to devising better ways of maximizing advertising and marketing budgets – targeting customers, especially the affluent, who might actually buy the product.	大量知识创新被用在了构思更好的最大化广告和影响预算的办法上 — — 将目标定位在实际可能购买产品的客户，特别是生活丰裕人群。
But standards of living might have been raised even more if all of this innovative talent had been allocated to more fundamental research – or even to more applied research that could have led to new products.	但如果创新天才用在更基本的研究上，或者用在能带来新产品的应用性更强的研究上，生活水平或许能得到更多的提升。
Yes, being better connected with each other, through Facebook or Twitter, is valuable.	是的，通过Facebook和Twitter更好地与他人互联是很有价值的。
But how can we compare these innovations with those like the laser, the transistor, the Turing machine, and the mapping of the human genome, each of which has led to a flood of transformative products?	但我们如何将这类创新与激光、晶体管、图灵机和人类基因组图谱这样的创新相比？ 后四者都带来了如潮水般的变革型产品。
Of course, there are grounds for a sigh of relief.	当然，我们也有理由不必瞎操心。
Although we may not know how much recent technological innovations are contributing to our wellbeing, at least we know that, unlike the wave of financial innovations that marked the pre-crisis global economy, the effect is positive.	尽管我们可能不知道最近的科技创新能给我们的福利形成多大贡献，但我们至少知道它们不是代表危机前全球经济的金融创新，它们的效果至少是正数。
	
Reforming China’s State-Market Balance	改革中国的国家-市场平衡
BEIJING – No country in recorded history has grown as fast – and moved as many people out of poverty – as China over the last thirty years.	北京—在有记录的历史中，没有一个国家可以向过去三十年中的中国那样增长得如此之快、将如此之多的人口带出贫困。
A hallmark of China’s success has been its leaders’ willingness to revise the country’s economic model when and as needed, despite opposition from powerful vested interests.	中国的成功的一大标志是其领导人愿意在需要时改变经济模式，即使面对强大的既得利益。
And now, as China implements another series of fundamental reforms, such interests are already lining up to resist.	如今，当中国再次实施根本性改革时，既得利益又要竭力阻止了。
Can the reformers triumph again?	改革派能够再次取胜吗？
In answering that question, the crucial point to bear in mind is that, as in the past, the current round of reforms will restructure not only the economy, but also the vested interests that will shape future reforms (and even determine whether they are possible).	要��答这一问题，一个需要铭记的关键点是，和过去一样，当前的改革重构的将不止是经济，还包括将决定未来改革面貌（甚至决定是否会发生未来改革）的既得利益。
And today, while high-profile initiatives – for example, the government’s widening anti-corruption campaign – receive much attention, the deeper issue that China faces concerns the appropriate roles of the state and the market.	如今，尽管高姿态的措施 — — 比如扩大反腐运动 — — 吸引了大量注意力，但中国面临的更深层次的问题是国家和市场的合适角色问题。
When China began its reforms more than three decades ago, the direction was clear: the market needed to play a far greater role in resource allocation.	三十年前中国开始改革开放时，方向是明确的：市场应该在资源配置中起到远比现状更大的作用。
And so it has, with the private sector far more important now than it was.	结果也是如此，如今私人部门比昔日重要不知凡几。
Moreover, there is a broad consensus that the market needs to play what officials call a “decisive role” in many sectors where state-owned enterprises (SOEs) dominate.	此外，一个广泛的共识是市场应该在许多国有企业主导的部门扮演官方所谓的“基础性作用 ” 。
But what should its role be in other sectors, and in the economy more generally?	但在其他部门以及作为整体的经济中，市场应该扮演什么作用？
Many of China’s problems today stem from too much market and too little government.	当今中国的许多问题源自市场太多而政府太少。
Or, to put it another way, while the government is clearly doing some things that it should not, it is also not doing some things that it should.	或者换句话说，尽管政府显然做了一些不该做的事，但也有一些应该做的事没做。
Worsening environmental pollution, for example, threatens living standards, while inequality of income and wealth now rivals that of the United States and corruption pervades public institutions and the private sector alike.	比如，环境污染的恶化威胁到生活水平，而收入和财富不平等已可以与美国相提并论，腐败在公私机构和部门中横行。
All of this undermines trust within society and in government – a trend that is particularly obvious with respect to, say, food safety.	所有这些都破坏了社会内部的信任和公众对政府的信任 — — 这在（比如）食品安全问题上表现的淋漓尽致。
Such problems could worsen as China restructures its economy away from export-led growth toward services and household consumption.	随着中国的经济结构向出口拉动型增长专线服务和家庭消费，这些问题可能进一步恶化。
Clearly, there is room for growth in private consumption; but embracing America’s profligate materialist life-style would be a disaster for China – and the planet.	显然，私人消费有增长的空间；但采取美国式的物质享乐生活方式对中国（以及全世界）来说将是一场灾难。
Air quality in China is already putting peoples’ lives at risk; global warming from even higher Chinese carbon emissions would threaten the entire world.	中国的空气质量已经威胁到人民的生命；中国不断增加的碳排放导致的全球变暖威胁着整个世界。
There is a better strategy.	有更好的战略。
For starters, Chinese living standards could and would increase if more resources were allocated to redress large deficiencies in health care and education.	首先，如果更多的资源被用于解决巨大的医疗和教育不足，中国人的生活水平可以也将会有所提高。
Here, government should play a leading role, and does so in most market economies, for good reason.	在这方面，政府应该起到领导作用，许多最“市场”的经济体也是如此，理由很充分。
America’s privately-based health-care system is expensive, inefficient, and achieves far worse outcomes than those in European countries, which spend far less.	美国的基于私人的医疗制度昂贵、低效，效果比花钱少得多的欧洲国家低得多。
A more market-based system is not the direction in which China should be going.	基于市场的医疗制度不是中国应该努力的方向。
In recent years, the government has made important strides in providing basic health care, especially in rural areas, and some have likened China’s approach to that of the United Kingdom, where private provision is layered atop a public base.	近几年来，政府在提供基本医疗方面（特别是农村地区）做出了巨大的努力，一些人认为中国的方法类似于英国，即在公共供给的基础上加上私人供给。
Whether that model is better than, say, French-style government-dominated provision may be debated.	这一模式是否优于（比如）法国式的政府主导供给还有待讨论。
But if one adopts the UK model, the level of the base makes all the difference; given the relatively small role of private health-care provision in the UK, the country has what is essentially a public system.	但如果你采取了英国模式，那么基础水平将决定最后结果的差异；英国的私人医疗供给程度相对较低，从本质上说是一套公共制度。
Likewise, though China has already made progress in moving away from manufacturing toward a service-based economy (the GDP share of services exceeded that of manufacturing for the first time in 2013), there is still a long way to go.	类似地，尽管中国在从基于制造的经济向基于服务的经济转变方面已经取得了不少进展（2013年，服务业占GDP比重第一次超过了制造业 ） ， 但还有很长的路要走。
Already, many industries are suffering from overcapacity, and efficient and smooth restructuring will not be easy without government help.	许多行业已经遭遇了产能过剩，没有政府的帮助，高效平滑的重组决非易事。
China is restructuring in another way: rapid urbanization.	中国正在以另一种方式重组：快速城镇化。
Ensuring that cities are livable and environmentally sustainable will require strong government action to provide sufficient public transport, public schools, public hospitals, parks, and effective zoning, among other public goods.	确保城市宜居、环境可持续需要政府花大力气提供充足的公共交通、公共学校、公共医院、公园和有效的区划以及其他公共品。
One major lesson that should have been learned from the post-2008 global economic crisis is that markets are not self-regulating.	2008年全球经济危机的一个主要教训是市场并不是自我监管的。
They are prone to asset and credit bubbles, which inevitably collapse – often when cross-border capital flows abruptly reverse direction – imposing massive social costs.	市场很难阻挡资产和信用泡沫，而泡沫必然会破裂 — — 通常在跨境资本流动突然转向是发生 — — 造成巨大的社会成本。
America’s infatuation with deregulation was the cause of the crisis.	美国沉迷于去监管化是危机的起源。
The issue is not just the pacing and sequencing of liberalization, as some suggest; the end result also matters.	这一问题并不像一些人所指出的那样仅仅是决定自由化节奏和顺序的问题；最终结果也十分重要。
Liberalization of deposit rates led to America’s savings and loan crisis in the 1980’s.	存款利率自由化导致了美国20世纪80年代的储贷危机。
Liberalization of lending rates encouraged predatory behavior that exploited poor consumers.	贷款利率自由化助长了掠夺贫穷消费者的行为。
Bank deregulation led not to more growth, but simply to more risk.	银行去监管话没有带来更多增长，只是带来了更多风险。
China, one hopes, will not take the route that America followed, with such disastrous consequences.	我们希望中国不会重蹈美国的覆辙，发生如此灾难性的后果。
The challenge for its leaders is to devise effective regulatory regimes that are appropriate for its stage of development.	中国领导人的挑战是设计有效的监管制度，与其发展阶段相适应。
That will require the government to raise more money.	这需要政府筹集更多资金。
Local governments’ current reliance on land sales is a source of many of the economy’s distortions – and much of the corruption.	目前，地方政府依赖卖地是许多经济扭曲（以及腐败）的源头。
Instead, the authorities should boost revenue by imposing environmental taxes (including a carbon tax), a more comprehensive progressive income tax (including capital gains), and a property tax.	相反，当局应该通过征收环境税（包括碳税 ） 、 采取更全面的累进所得税（包括资本利得税）和物业税增加收入。
Moreover, the state should appropriate, through dividends, a larger share of SOEs’ value (some of which might be at the expense of these firms’ managers.)	此外，国家应该获得国有企业的更大比例的价值（一些国有企业管理者将因此遭受损失 ） ， 这可以通过分红实现。
The question is whether China can maintain rapid growth (though somewhat slower than its recent breakneck pace), even as it reins in credit expansion (which could cause an abrupt reversal in asset prices), confronts weak global demand, restructures its economy, and fights corruption. In other countries, such daunting challenges have led to paralysis, not progress.	问题在于中国能否在遏制信用扩张（可能导致资产价格的突然逆转 ） 、 面临全球需求疲软、实现经济结构重组和打击腐败的同事维持快速增长（尽管略慢于最近的高速 ） 。
The economics of success is clear: higher spending on urbanization, health care, and education, funded by increases in taxes, could simultaneously sustain growth, improve the environment, and reduce inequality.	成功的经济学是明确的：以征税为筹资手段提高城镇化、医疗和教育的支出可以同时实现维持增长、改善环境和降低不平等性。
If China’s politics can manage the implementation of this agenda, China and the entire world will be better off.	如果中国的政治能够设法实施这一日程，那么中国和全世界都将受益。
	
Democracy in the Twenty-First Century	二十一世纪民主论
NEW YORK – The reception in the United States, and in other advanced economies, of Thomas Piketty’s recent book Capital in the Twenty-First Century attests to growing concern about rising inequality.	纽约—美国和其他发达经济体对托马斯·皮克提（Thomas Piketty）的近著《二十一世纪资本论 》 （ Capital in the Twenty-First Century）的反应彰显出人们对不平等性恶化的日益担忧。
His book lends further weight to the already overwhelming body of evidence concerning the soaring share of income and wealth at the very top.	他的书为已有压倒性证据添砖加瓦，证明了收入和财富正在急剧地向最顶层集中。
Piketty’s book, moreover, provides a different perspective on the 30 or so years that followed the Great Depression and World War II, viewing this period as a historical anomaly, perhaps caused by the unusual social cohesion that cataclysmic events can stimulate.	此外，皮克提的书还提供了新的视角审视大萧条和第二次世界大战之后的三十来年，将这段时间视为历史的异常期，其出现的原因也许是灾难性事件能够刺激不同寻常的社会凝聚力。
In that era of rapid economic growth, prosperity was widely shared, with all groups advancing, but with those at the bottom seeing larger percentage gains.	在这个经济高速增长的时代，繁荣被广泛分享，所有群体都在进步，但位于��层的人群改善比例最大。
Piketty also sheds new light on the “reforms” sold by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s as growth enhancers from which all would benefit.	皮克提还提出了新的视角审视罗纳德·里根和玛格丽特·撒切尔在20世纪80年代所实施的“改革 ” ， 他们的改革带来了让所有人受益的增长提振。
Their reforms were followed by slower growth and heightened global instability, and what growth did occur benefited mostly those at the top.	随之而来的是增长的减速和全球不平等性的高企，而增长所带来的好处大部分给顶层人群拿走了。
But Piketty’s work raises fundamental issues concerning both economic theory and the future of capitalism.	但皮克提的著作给经济学理论和资本主义的未来都提出了根本性问题。
He documents large increases in the wealth/output ratio.	他记录了财富/产出比的大幅上升。
In standard theory, such increases would be associated with a fall in the return to capital and an increase in wages.	在标准经济学理论中，这类上升应该伴随着资本回报的下降和工资的增长。
But today the return to capital does not seem to have diminished, though wages have.	但眼下资本回报似乎并未下降，倒是工资下降了。
(In the US, for example, average wages have stagnated over the past four decades.)	（比如，在美国，过去四十年来平均工资一直停滞不前。 ）
The most obvious explanation is that the increase in measured wealth does not correspond to an increase in productive capital – and the data seem consistent with this interpretation.	最显而易见的解释是测得的财富增长并不同步于生产性资本的增加 — — 数据也与这一解释相符。
Much of the increase in wealth stemmed from an increase in the value of real estate.	财富的增加有很大一部分来自房地产价值的升高。
Before the 2008 financial crisis, a real-estate bubble was evident in many countries; even now, there may not have been a full “correction.”	2008年金融危机前，房地产泡沫在许多国家显而易见；甚至现在或许也不曾得到完全的“修正 ” 。
The rise in value also can represent competition among the rich for “positional” goods – a house on the beach or an apartment on New York City’s Fifth Avenue.	房地产价值的上升也体现了富人的“地位”商品竞争 — — 争相购买海滨别墅或纽约第五大道公寓。
Sometimes an increase in measured financial wealth corresponds to little more than a shift from “unmeasured” wealth to measured wealth – shifts that can actually reflect deterioration in overall economic performance.	fenp2052有时测得金融财富的增长无非是因为一些“未测得”财富变成了测得财富 — — 这一变化实际上可能反映了总体经济绩效的恶化。
If monopoly power increases, or firms (like banks) develop better methods of exploiting ordinary consumers, it will show up as higher profits and, when capitalized, as an increase in financial wealth.	如果垄断实力提高，或企业（如银行）发展出更好的掠夺不同消费者的办法，就会表现出更高的利润，如果对此资本化，就表现出金融财富的增加。
But when this happens, of course, societal wellbeing and economic efficiency fall, even as officially measured wealth rises.	但是，当这一幕发生时，显然社会福利和经济效率将下降，即使官方测得财富增加了。
We simply do not take into account the corresponding diminution of the value of human capital – the wealth of workers.	我们根本就不会记录与之相应的人力资本价值 — — 工人的财富 — — 的下降。
Moreover, if banks succeed in using their political influence to socialize losses and retain more and more of their ill-gotten gains, the measured wealth in the financial sector increases.	此外，如果银行成功地利用政治影响力实现成本社会化，同时留存越来越多的不当得利，那么金融部门的测得财富就会增加。
We do not measure the corresponding diminution of taxpayers’ wealth.	我们不会测量相应的纳税人财富的下降。
Likewise, if corporations convince the government to overpay for their products (as the major drug companies have succeeded in doing), or are given access to public resources at below-market prices (as mining companies have succeeded in doing), reported financial wealth increases, though the wealth of ordinary citizens does not.	类似地，如果公司说服政府给其产品支付过高价格（大型制药公司在这方面做得相当成功 ） ， 或者能够以抵御市场价格获得公共资源（矿业公司在这方面做得相当成功 ） ， 报告金融财富就会增加，尽管普通公民财富的下降不会被记录。
What we have been observing – wage stagnation and rising inequality, even as wealth increases – does not reflect the workings of a normal market economy, but of what I call “ersatz capitalism.”	我们所观察到的现象 — — 工资停滞和不平等性恶化，尽管财富在增加 — — 并非正常的市场经济的作用结果，而是我所谓的“伪资本主义”作用的结果。
The problem may not be with how markets should or do work, but with our political system, which has failed to ensure that markets are competitive, and has designed rules that sustain distorted markets in which corporations and the rich can (and unfortunately do) exploit everyone else.	问题后续不是市场应该如何作用或实际如何作用，而在于我们的政治制度，这套制度无法确保市场的竞争性，其所涉及的规则维持了市场的扭曲性，让公司和富人能够（不幸的是，他们确实这么做了）掠夺其他所有人。
Markets, of course, do not exist in a vacuum.	当然，市场并不是存在于真空中的。
There have to be rules of the game, and these are established through political processes.	必须有游戏规则，而游戏规则是通过政治过程建立的。
High levels of economic inequality in countries like the US and, increasingly, those that have followed its economic model, lead to political inequality.	在美国 — — 追随其经济模式的国家也正在日益变得这样 — — 经济不平等性高企导致了政治不平等性。
In such a system, opportunities for economic advancement become unequal as well, reinforcing low levels of social mobility.	在这样的制度中，经济进步的机会也变得不平等，进一步降低了社会流动性。
Thus, Piketty’s forecast of still higher levels of inequality does not reflect the inexorable laws of economics.	因此，皮克提的预测 — — 不平等性程度还会继续加剧 — — 所反映的并非不可撼动的经济学定律。
Simple changes – including higher capital-gains and inheritance taxes, greater spending to broaden access to education, rigorous enforcement of anti-trust laws, corporate-governance reforms that circumscribe executive pay, and financial regulations that rein in banks’ ability to exploit the rest of society – would reduce inequality and increase equality of opportunity markedly.	简单地改变 — — 包括提高资本利得税和遗产税、增加教育普及支出、严格执行反垄断法律、约束高管薪酬的公司治理改革、遏制银行掠夺社会其他部门的能力的金融监管等 — — 就能显著降低不平等性，增加机会平等性。
If we get the rules of the game right, we might even be able to restore the rapid and shared economic growth that characterized the middle-class societies of the mid-twentieth century.	如果我们为游戏设置正确的规则，甚至有望重塑快速且被各群体所共享的经济增长，就像二十世纪中叶中产阶级社会那样。
The main question confronting us today is not really about capital in the twenty-first century. It is about democracy in the twenty-first century.	我们今天所面临的主要问题其实并非关于二十一世纪的资本，而是关于二十一世纪的民主。
	
Creating a Learning Society	打造学习型社会
NEW YORK – Citizens in the world’s richest countries have come to think of their economies as being based on innovation.	纽约—最发达国家的公民已开始认为他们的经济建立在创新的基础上。
But innovation has been part of the developed world’s economy for more than two centuries.	但创新成为发达世界经济的一部分已有两个多世纪的历史。
Indeed, for thousands of years, until the Industrial Revolution, incomes stagnated.	事实上，几千年来，直到工业革命前，收入一直处于停滞状态。
Then per capita income soared, increasing year after year, interrupted only by the occasional effects of cyclical fluctuations.	工业革命后，人均收入开始激增，一年更比一年高，只是时常会受到周期性波动的干扰。
The Nobel laureate economist Robert Solow noted some 60 years ago that rising incomes should largely be attributed not to capital accumulation, but to technological progress – to learning how to do things better.	60年前，诺贝尔经济学奖获得者罗伯特·索洛（Robert Solow）指出，收入的提高主要不是来自资本积累，而是来自技术进步 — — 即学习如何将事情做得更好。
While some of the productivity increase reflects the impact of dramatic discoveries, much of it has been due to small, incremental changes.	尽管生产率的提高部分反映了重大发现的影响，但大部分都要归因于渐进的小变革。
And, if that is the case, it makes sense to focus attention on how societies learn, and what can be done to promote learning – including learning how to learn.	果真如此的话，就应该将注意力集中在社会如何学���以及如何促进学习上 — — 包括学习如何学习。
A century ago, the economist and political scientist Joseph Schumpeter argued that the central virtue of a market economy was its capacity to innovate.	一个世纪前，经济学家兼政治学家约瑟夫·熊彼特（Joseph Schumpeter）指出，市场经济的最大好处是其创新能力。
He contended that economists’ traditional focus on competitive markets was misplaced; what mattered was competition for the market, not competition in the market.	他认为，传统上经济学家关注竞争市场，这是个错误；真正重要的是为创造市场而竞争，而不是在市场中竞争。
Competition for the market drove innovation.	为创造市场而竞争推动了创新。
A succession of monopolists would lead, in this view, to higher standards of living in the long run.	根据这一观点，从长期看，前赴后继的垄断者能带来生活水平的提高。
Schumpeter’s conclusions have not gone unchallenged.	熊彼特的结论受到了挑战。
Monopolists and dominant firms, like Microsoft, can actually suppress innovation.	垄断者和主导且 — — 如微软等 — — 实际上可能抑制创新。
Unless checked by anti-trust authorities, they can engage in anti-competitive behavior that reinforces their monopoly power.	除非受到反垄断当局制约，否则它们可能采取反竞争行为以强化垄断力。
Moreover, markets may not be efficient in either the level or direction of investments in research and learning.	此外，市场在决定研究和学习投资水平或方向方面未必有效。
Private incentives are not well aligned with social returns: firms can gain from innovations that increase their market power, enable them to circumvent regulations, or channel rents that would otherwise accrue to others.	私人激励与社会回报并不完美匹配：企业可以从增强器市场实力的创新中获益，使它们能够绕过监管或将本可能流向他人的租引导到自己囊中。
But one of Schumpeter’s fundamental insights has held up well: Conventional policies focusing on short-run efficiency may not be desirable, once one takes a long-run innovation/learning perspective.	但熊彼特的一个基本洞见是成立的：从长期创新/学习角度看，关注短期效率的传统政策或许并不值得追求。
This is especially true for developing countries and emerging markets.	对于发展中国家和新兴市场而言尤其如此。
Industrial policies – in which governments intervene in the allocation of resources among sectors or favor some technologies over others – can help “infant economies” learn.	产业政策 — — 政府干预资源在各部门间的配置或优待某些技术 — — 有助于“婴儿经济体 ” （ infant economy）学习。
Learning may be more marked in some sectors (such as industrial manufacturing) than in others, and the benefits of that learning, including the institutional development required for success, may spill over to other economic activities.	一些部门（如工业生产部门）的学习可能会胜过其他部门，而学习的好处，包括成功所必须的制度发展 — — 可能溢出到其他经济活动中。
Such policies, when adopted, have been frequent targets of criticism.	当采取这些政策时，往往会招来批评。
Government, it is often said, should not be engaged in picking winners.	人们常说，政府不应该主动去挑选赢家。
The market is far better in making such judgments.	在这方面，市场的判断要好得多。
But the evidence on that is not as compelling as free-market advocates claim.	但这方面的证据并不如自由市场鼓吹者宣称的那样令人信服。
America’s private sector was notoriously bad in allocating capital and managing risk in the years before the global financial crisis, while studies show that average returns to the economy from government research projects are actually higher than those from private-sector projects – especially because the government invests more heavily in important basic research.	美国私人部门在全球金融危机前几年的配置资本和管理风险水平之低已是众所周知，而研究表明，经济得自政府研究项目的平均回报其实要高于私人部门项目 — — 特别是因为政府投资更偏向重要的基础研究。
One only needs to think of the social benefits traceable to the research that led to the development of the Internet or the discovery of DNA.	只要想一想催生了互联网的发展和DNA的发现的研究就能一窥端倪。
But, putting such successes aside, the point of industrial policy is not to pick winners at all.	但是，除却这些成功不谈，产业政策的要点决非挑选赢家。
Rather, successful industrial policies identify sources of positive externalities – sectors where learning might generate benefits elsewhere in the economy.	相反，成功的产业政策要识别具有正外部性的资源 — — 即本部门学习可能给经济的其他部门带来好处的部门。
Viewing economic policies through the lens of learning provides a different perspective on many issues.	从学习的角度看待经济政策让我们能用不同的目光审视许多问题。
The great economist Kenneth Arrow emphasized the importance of learning by doing.	著名经济学家肯尼斯·阿罗（Kenneth Arrow）强调干中学（learning by doing）的重要性。
The only way to learn what is required for industrial growth, for example, is to have industry.	比如，学习产业成长的必要基础的唯一办法是拥有该产业。
And that may require either ensuring that one’s exchange rate is competitive or that certain industries have privileged access to credit – as a number of East Asian countries did as part of their remarkably successful development strategies.	而这需要有高竞争力的汇率或者某些产业拥有获得信用的特权 — — 这正是许多东亚国家取得巨大成功的发展战略的要点。
There is a compelling infant economy argument for industrial protection.	婴儿经济体有一个很强大的产业保护理由。
Moreover, financial-market liberalization may undermine countries’ ability to learn another set of skills that are essential for development: how to allocate resources and manage risk.	此外，金融市场自由化可能破坏一国学习发展所必须的技能组合的能力，即如何配置资源和管理风险。
Likewise, intellectual property, if not designed properly, can be a two-edged sword when viewed from a learning perspective.	类似地，知识产权如能得到合理设计，可以成为学习角度看来的双刃剑。
While it may enhance incentives to invest in research, it may also enhance incentives for secrecy – impeding the flow of knowledge that is essential to learning while encouraging firms to maximize what they draw from the pool of collective knowledge and to minimize what they contribute.	它能够强化研究投资激励，但也可能强化保密激励 — — 阻止学习的关键知识的流动并鼓励企业尽可能在集体知识总量中占取最大份额、贡献最小力量。
In this scenario, the pace of innovation is actually reduced.	在这一情形中，创新的速度实际上可能受到削弱。
More broadly, many of the policies (especially those associated with the neoliberal “Washington Consensus”) foisted on developing countries with the noble objective of promoting the efficiency of resource allocation today actually impede learning, and thus lead to lower standards of living in the long run.	更广地看，许多打着促进当今资源配置效率的冠冕堂皇的口号强加给发展中国家的政策（特别是与新自由主义“华盛顿共识”相关的政策）实际上在阻碍学习，从而导致长期生活水平下降。
Virtually every government policy, intentionally or not, for better or for worse, has direct and indirect effects on learning.	几乎所有政府政策 — — 不管有意还是无意，好还是差 — — 都会对学习造成直接和间接的影响。
Developing countries where policymakers are cognizant of these effects are more likely to close the knowledge gap that separates them from the more developed countries.	决策者认识到这一影响的发展中国家更有可能弥补让它们与发达国家产生区别的知识差距。
Developed countries, meanwhile, have an opportunity to narrow the gap between average and best practices, and to avoid the danger of secular stagnation.	与此同时，发达国家有机会缩小一般实践和最佳实践之间的差别，避免长期停滞的危险。
	
South Africa Breaks Out	南非的爆发
NEW YORK – International investment agreements are once again in the news.	纽约—国际投资协定再一次成为新闻。
The United States is trying to impose a strong investment pact within the two big so-called “partnership” agreements, one bridging the Atlantic, the other the Pacific, that are now being negotiated. But there is growing opposition to such moves.	美国正在试图在两份大型的所谓“合作伙伴”协定中纳入强大的贸易契约，其中一个协定联系大西洋，另一个联系太平洋，目前都在谈判中。
South Africa has decided to stop the automatic renewal of investment agreements that it signed in the early post-apartheid period, and has announced that some will be terminated.	南非决定不再为后种族隔离时代早期签署的投资协定自动更新，并且宣布一些投资协定将会终结。
Ecuador and Venezuela have already terminated theirs.	厄瓜多尔和委内瑞拉已经终结了它们的投资协定。
India says that it will sign an investment agreement with the US only if the dispute-resolution mechanism is changed.	印度表示只有在争议解决机制做出改变后才会与美国签署投资协定。
For its part, Brazil has never had one at all.	而巴西则没有签署贸易协定。
There is good reason for the resistance.	如此抵制，其来有自。
Even in the US, labor unions and environmental, health, development, and other nongovernmental organizations have objected to the agreements that the US is proposing.	即使在美国，工会和环保、健康、发展和其他非政府组织也在反对美国正在推行的协定。
The agreements would significantly inhibit the ability of developing countries’ governments to protect their environment from mining and other companies; their citizens from the tobacco companies that knowingly purvey a product that causes death and disease; and their economies from the ruinous financial products that played such a large role in the 2008 global financial crisis.	这些协定会极大地制约发展中国家政府保护其环境不受矿业和其他公司伤害、其人民不受有意识地推销致病致死产品的烟草公司的伤害、以及其经济不受在2008年全球金融危机中扮演重要角色的破坏性金融产品伤害的能力。
They restrict governments even from placing temporary controls on the kind of destabilizing short-term capital flows that have so often wrought havoc in financial markets and fueled crises in developing countries.	这些协定甚至还限制政府，使其难以采取针对破坏性短期资本流的临时性管制，这类资本流经常造成发展中国家金融市场浩劫、助长危机。
Indeed, the agreements have been used to challenge government actions ranging from debt restructuring to affirmative action.	事实上，这些协定被利用来制约从债务重组到平权行动的各种政府行为。
Advocates of such agreements claim that they are needed to protect property rights.	这些协定的支持者宣称需要靠它们来保护产权。
But countries like South Africa already have strong constitutional guarantees of property rights.	但南非等国家已经建立了强大的宪法产权保护。
There is no reason that foreign-owned property should be better protected than property owned by a country’s own citizens.	外国���有的产权没有道理应该获得比本国公民所有产权更好的保护。
Moreover, if constitutional guarantees are not enough to convince investors of South Africa’s commitment to protecting property rights, foreigners can always avail themselves of expropriation insurance provided by the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (a division of the World Bank) or numerous national organizations providing such insurance.	此外，如果宪法保护仍不足以说服南非投资者信任南非的产权保护承诺，那么外国人还可以投保没收险，多边投资担保机构（Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency，世界银行的一个分支）和其他多个国家组织提供这种保险。
(Americans, for example, can buy insurance from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.)	（比如，美国可以向海外私人投资公司（Overseas Private Investment Corporation）购买这种保险。 ）
But those supporting the investment agreements are not really concerned about protecting property rights, anyway.	但支持投资协定者并不真关心产权保护。
The real goal is to restrict governments’ ability to regulate and tax corporations – that is, to restrict their ability to impose responsibilities, not just uphold rights.	他们的真正目标是限制政府对公司进行监管和课税的能力 — — 也就是说，不仅要保护权利，还要限制政府施加义务的能力。
Corporations are attempting to achieve by stealth – through secretly negotiated trade agreements – what they could not attain in an open political process.	公司试图通过公开政治流程无法提供的地下途径实现这一点 — — 如秘密贸易协定谈判。
Even the notion that this is about protecting foreign firms is a ruse: companies based in country A can set up a subsidiary in country B to sue country A’s government.	即使是这事关保护外国企业的概念也只是一条诡计：以A国为总部的公司可以在B国开设分公司起诉A国政府。
American courts, for example, have consistently ruled that corporations need not be compensated for the loss of profits from a change in regulations (a so-called regulatory taking); but, under the typical investment agreement, a foreign firm (or an American firm, operating through a foreign subsidiary) can demand compensation!	比如，美国法院一直判定不必因为监管变化导致的利润损失（所谓的监管征收）赔偿公司；但是，在典型的投资协定中，外国企业（或者通过外国分公司经营的美国企业）可以要求赔偿！
Worse, investment agreements enable companies to sue the government over perfectly sensible and just regulatory changes – when, say, a cigarette company’s profits are lowered by a regulation restricting the use of tobacco.	更糟糕的是，投资协定让公司能够因为完全合理合规的变化起诉政府 — — 比如当某香烟公司利润因为监管规则限制烟草的使用而利润下降时。
In South Africa, a firm could sue if it believes that its bottom line might by harmed by programs designed to address the legacy of official racism.	在南非，企业若认为其利润因为旨在纠正官方种族主义遗留问题的计划而受损，就可以提起诉讼。
There is a long-standing presumption of “sovereign immunity”: states can be sued only under limited circumstances.	关于“主权豁免”的推定由来已久：国家只有在极为有限情形中可以被提起诉讼。
But investment agreements like those backed by the US demand that developing countries waive this presumption and permit the adjudication of suits according to procedures that fall far short of those expected in twenty-first-century democracies.	但美国所支持的投资协定要求放弃这一推定，允许根据与21世纪民主要求差距甚远的先例的裁定诉讼。
Such procedures have proved to be arbitrary and capricious, with no systemic way to reconcile incompatible rulings issued by different panels.	这些先例早已被证明是武断的、反复无常的，缺少协调不同方面给出的不相容规则的系统性办法。
While proponents argue that investment treaties reduce uncertainty, the ambiguities and conflicting interpretations of these agreements’ provisions have increased uncertainty.	支持者指出投资条约能减少不确定性，但这些协定条款的模糊性和解读的冲突性实际上增加了不确定性。
Countries that have signed such investment agreements have paid a high price.	签署了这类投资协定的国家为此付出了沉重代价。
Several have been subject to enormous suits – and enormous payouts.	一些国家诉讼缠身，并付出了巨额赔付。
There have even been demands that countries honor contracts signed by previous non-democratic and corrupt governments, even when the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral organizations have recommended that the contract be abrogated.	协定要求签署国尊重在非民主时期的腐败政府所签署的契约，即便IMF和其他多边机构建议废除这些契约。
Even when developing-country governments win the suits (which have proliferated greatly in the last 15 years), the litigation costs are huge.	即使发展中国家赢得诉讼（在过去15年中，这样的案例很多 ） ， 法律成本也极其高昂。
The (intended) effect is to chill governments’ legitimate efforts to protect and advance citizens’ interests by imposing regulations, taxation, and other responsibilities on corporations.	其（有意造成的）结果是制约了政府通过对公司施加监管、税收和其他责任来保护和促进公民利益的合法努力。
Moreover, for developing countries that were foolish enough to sign such agreements, the evidence is that the benefits, if any, have been scant.	此外，对不慎签署了这类协定的发展中国家而言，证据表明利（如果有的话）大于弊。
In South Africa’s review, it found that it had not received significant investments from the countries with which it had signed agreements, but had received significant investments from those with which it had not.	在南非看来，它并未从签署了协定的国家那里获得多少投资，反而从未签署协定的国家中获得了大量投资。
It is no surprise that South Africa, after a careful review of investment treaties, has decided that, at the very least, they should be renegotiated.	毫不奇怪，南非在再三权衡投资条约后决定至少应该进行重新谈判。
Doing so is not anti-investment; it is pro-development.	这样做并不是反投资；而是支持发展。
And it is essential if South Africa’s government is to pursue policies that best serve the country’s economy and citizens.	而如果南非政府意在推行最适合本国经济和国民的政策，这样做更是必不可少的。
Indeed, by clarifying through domestic legislation the protections offered to investors, South Africa is once again demonstrating – as it has repeatedly done since the adoption of its new Constitution in 1996 – its commitment to the rule of law.	事实上，通过国内立法明确对投资者的保护，南非再一次证明了 — — 自1996年采取新宪法以来已经有过多次先例 — — 其对法治精神的坚持。
It is the investment agreements themselves that most seriously threaten democratic decision-making.	投资协定本身才是民主决策的最大威胁。
South Africa should be congratulated.	南非应该获得掌声。
Other countries, one hopes, will follow suit.	我们希望其他国家也能效而仿之。
	
A Light Unto Cities	照向城市的光
NEW YORK – Last month, a remarkable gathering occurred in Medellín, Colombia.	纽约—上个月，在哥伦比亚麦德林发生了一场令人瞩目的集会。
Some 22,000 people came together to attend the World Urban Forum and discuss the future of cities.	大约22,000人聚集于此参加世界城市论坛（World Urban Forum ） ， 讨论城市的未来。
The focus was on creating “cities for life” – that is, on promoting equitable development in the urban environments in which a majority of the world’s citizens already live, and in which two thirds will reside by the year 2050.	论坛中心议题是创造“生活之城 ” ， 即促进城市环境下的公平发展。 目前，世界大部分人民生活在城市中，到2050年，城市居民比例将超过三分之二。
The location itself was symbolic: Once notorious for its drug gangs, Medellín now has a well-deserved reputation as one of the most innovative cities in the world.	会议地点本身便具有象征意义：麦德林曾经以贩毒黑帮闻名于世，现在大可跻身于最具创精神城市之列。
The tale of the city’s transformation holds important lessons for urban areas everywhere.	麦德林的故事可以作为所有城市地区的重要经验。
In the 1980’s and 1990’s, cartel bosses like the infamous Pablo Escobar ruled Medellín’s streets and controlled its politics.	在20世纪八九十年代，大名鼎鼎的帕博罗·埃斯科巴（Pablo Escobar）等卡特尔老板统治者麦德林的街头、掌握着麦德林的政治。
The source of Escobar’s power was not just the hugely profitable international cocaine trade (fueled by demand in the United States), but also extreme inequality in Medellín and Colombia.	埃斯科巴权力的源泉不仅来自国际可卡因贸易的巨大利润（受美国需求推动 ） ， 也来源于麦德林和哥伦比亚的极端不平等。
On the steep Andean slopes of the valley that cradles the city, vast slums, virtually abandoned by the government, provided a ready supply of recruits for the cartels.	麦德林坐落于陡峭的安第斯山谷，在这里，位数庞大的贫民被政府所抛弃，从而为卡特尔提供了大量人力资源。
In the absence of public services, Escobar won the hearts and minds of Medellín’s poorest with his largesse – even as he terrorized the city.	在缺乏公共服务的情况下，埃斯科巴用他的慷慨赢得了麦德林贫民的心 — — 即便他对麦德林实施着恐怖统治。
One can hardly recognize those slums today.	如今，你很难看到贫民窟的存在。
In the poor neighborhood of Santo Domingo, the city’s new Metrocable system, consisting of three lines of aerial gondolas, serves residents hundreds of vertical feet up a mountainside, ending their isolation from the city center.	在圣多明各（Santo Domingo）的贫穷社区，政府架设了三条悬空式城市铁轨，为居住在数百英尺高的半山腰的居民提供通勤，使他们不再与市中心隔离。
The commute is now minutes, and the social and economic barriers between the informal settlements and the rest of the city are on their way to being broken down.	如今，通勤时间可以用分钟计算，地下定居点和麦德林其他地区之间的社会和经济壁垒正在被消除。
The problems of the city’s poor neighborhoods have not been erased, but the benefits that the infrastructure improvements have brought are brilliantly evident in the well-kept houses, murals, and soccer fields perched near the gondola stations.	麦德林贫穷社区的问题并没有被根治，但基础设施改善带来了巨大的好处 — — 在城铁站周边，整洁的房屋、壁画和足球场随处可见。 城铁只是麦德林最具代表性的工程。
The cable cars are only the most iconic of the projects for which Medellín last year won Harvard University’s Veronica Rudge Green Prize in Urban Design, the most prestigious award in the field.	去年，麦德林赢得业内最富盛名的哈佛大学维罗妮卡·拉齐绿色城市设计奖（Veronica Rudge Green Prize in Urban Design ） 。
Beginning with the mayoralty of Sergio Fajardo (now the governor of Medellín’s department, Antioquia), who took office in 2004, the city has made major efforts to transform its slums, improve education, and promote development.	从塞尔吉奥·法亚尔多（Sergio Fajardo，现为麦德林所在的安提奥奎亚（Antioquia）省省长）2004年出任市长以来，麦德林在改变贫民窟、改善教育和促进发展方面做出了巨大的努力。
(The current mayor, Aníbal Gaviria, has affirmed his commitment to continuing on this path.)	（现任市长阿尼巴尔·加维里亚（Aníbal Gaviria）也承诺将继续沿着这一方向努力。 ）
Medellín constructed avant-garde public buildings in areas that were the most run down, provided house paint to citizens living in poor districts, and cleaned up and improved the streets – all in the belief that if you treat people with dignity, they will value their surroundings and take pride in their communities.	麦德林在最破败的地区建设了一批后现代风格的公房，为生活在贫困区的市民提供住房，并对道路做了清洁和改善 — — 麦德林这样做的信条是，如果你给予人民尊严，他们就会珍视环境并以社区为荣。
And that faith has been more than borne out.	这一信条得到了验证。
Throughout the world, cities are both the locus and the focus of society’s major debates, and for good reason.	放眼全世界，城市是社会主要争议的中心和焦点，这可谓名符其实。
When individuals live in close quarters, they cannot escape major societal problems: growing inequality, environmental degradation, and inadequate public investment.	当个体挨得很近生活时，就无法摆脱主要社会问题：不平等性增加、环境恶化以及公共投资不足。
The forum reminded participants that livable cities require planning – a message at odds with prevailing attitudes in much of the world.	论坛提醒与会者，宜居城市需要规划，这与世界大部分地区流行的观点相悖。
But without planning and government investment in infrastructure, public transportation and parks, and the provision of clean water and sanitation, cities won’t be livable.	但若不进行规划和基础设施、公共交通和公园的政府投资、不提供清洁水源和卫生服务，城市就不可能宜居。
And it is the poor who inevitably suffer the most from the absence of these public goods.	而这些公共品的缺失影响最大的难免是穷人。
Medellín holds some lessons for America, too.	麦德林也给美国带来了一些教训。
Indeed, recent research shows how inadequate planning has fueled economic segregation in the United States, and how poverty traps have formed in cities without public transportation, owing to a shortage of accessible jobs.	事实上，最新研究表明，规划不充分导致美国经济隔离加剧，缺乏公共交通的城市由于易得职位的短缺而陷入了贫穷陷阱。
The conference went beyond this, emphasizing that “livable cities” are not enough.	此次会议的意义不止于此，会议强调 ， “ 宜居城市”不是终点。
We need to create urban areas in which individuals can flourish and innovate.	我们需要居民可以发展和创新的城市地区。
It is no accident that the Enlightenment – which led in turn to the fastest and largest increases in living standards in human history – unfolded in cities.	启蒙运动 — — 它反过来引领了人类历史上最快、最大的生活水平提升 — — 出现在城市中不是偶然。
New thinking is a natural consequence of high population density, provided the right conditions are met – conditions that include public spaces in which people can interact and culture can thrive, and a democratic ethos that welcomes and encourages public participation.	新思想是高人口密度的自然结果，只要满足正确的条件 — — 这些条件包括人们可以互动、文化可以繁荣的公共空间以及欢迎和鼓励公共参与的民主氛围。
A key theme of the forum was the emerging consensus on the need for environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable development.	论坛的一个中心主题是新出现的共识：我们需要环境、社会和经济可持续的发展。
All of these aspects of sustainability are intertwined and complementary, and cities provide the context in which this is most clear.	这三大可持续性是相辅相成的，城市提供了最显而易见的显例。
One of the biggest obstacles to achieving sustainability is inequality.	阻止实现可持续性的最大障碍之一是不平等性。
Our economies, our democracies, and our societies pay a high price for the growing gap between the rich and poor.	我们的经济、我们的民主和我们的社会为贫富差距的不断扩大付出了高昂的代价。
And perhaps the most invidious aspect of the widening income and wealth gap in so many countries is that it is deepening inequality of opportunity.	也许众多国家收入和财富差距加剧最危险的方面在于机会不平等的深化。
Some cities have shown that these widely observed patterns are not the result of immutable economic laws.	一些城市已经证明，这些被广泛观察到的模式并非永恒的经济定律的结果。
Even in the advanced country with the most inequality – the US – some cities, like San Francisco and San Jose, are comparable to the best-performing economies in terms of equality of opportunity.	即使在不平等性最大的发达国家 — — 美国，也有旧金山和圣何塞等在机会平等方面可以与表现最优秀经济体相媲美的城市。
With political gridlock afflicting so many national governments around the world, forward-thinking cities are becoming a beacon of hope.	政治僵局困扰着世界范围内许多国家的政府，在这样的情况下，前瞻性城市就成了希望的灯塔。
A divided US seems incapable of addressing its alarming increase in inequality.	分裂的美国似乎无法纠正其值得警惕的不平等性加剧问题。
But in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio was elected on the promise of doing something about it.	但在纽约市，比尔·德布拉西奥（Bill de Blasio）市长因为承诺努力改变这一点而当选。
While there are limits to what can be done at the local level – national taxation, for instance, is far more important than municipal taxes – cities can help ensure the availability of affordable housing.	尽管地方层面的作为具有局限性 — — 比如，国税比市政税重要得多 — — 但城市可以帮助确保平价房的可获得性。
And they have a special responsibility to provide high-quality public education and public amenities for all, regardless of income.	城市也在向不论收入如何的全体市民提供高质量公共教育和公共康乐设施方面具有特别责任。
Medellín and the World Urban Forum have shown that this is not just a pipe dream.	麦德林和世界城市论坛证明，这不仅仅是白日梦。
Another world is possible; we need only the political will to pursue it.	新世界是可能存在的；我们需要的只是追求新世界的政治意愿。
	
Advanced Malaise	发达国家之恙
NEW YORK – Economics is often called the dismal science, and for the last half-decade it has come by its reputation honestly in the advanced economies.	纽约—经济学常常被称为忧郁的科学，对于过去五年的发达经济体来说，这一称谓名符其实。
Unfortunately, the year ahead will bring little relief.	不幸的是，刚刚到来的新的一年也不会有多少改变。
Real (inflation-adjusted) per capita GDP in France, Greece, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States is lower today than before the Great Recession hit.	如今，法国、希腊、意大利、西班牙、英国和美国的实际（经通胀调整的）人均GDP比大衰退来临前更低。
Indeed, Greece’s per capita GDP has shrunk nearly 25% since 2008.	事实上，希腊的人均GDP比2008年低了近25 % 。
There are a few exceptions: After more than two decades, Japan’s economy appears to be turning a corner under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government; but, with a legacy of deflation stretching back to the 1990’s, it will be a long road back.	也有少数例外：在经历了二十多年的停滞后，日本经济在首相安倍晋三政府的带领下扭转了局面；但是，通缩从20世纪90年代就开始困扰日本，走出通缩还有很长的路要走。
And Germany’s real per capita GDP was higher in 2012 than it was in 2007 – though an increase of 3.9% in five years is not much to boast about.	2012年，德国的实际人均GDP高于2007年，尽管五年增长3.7%实在没什么好值得骄傲的。
Elsewhere, though, things really are dismal: unemployment in the eurozone remains stubbornly high and the long-term unemployment rate in the US still far exceeds its pre-recession levels.	但是，在其他地区，情况名符其实地令人忧郁：欧元区失业率仍居高不下，美国的长期失业率仍高于衰退前水平。
In Europe, growth appears set to return this year, though at a truly anemic rate, with the International Monetary Fund projecting a 1% annual increase in output.	在欧洲，增长有望在今年回归，尽管速度将非常缓慢，国际货币基金组织（IMF）的产出增长预测是1 % 。
In fact, the IMF’s forecasts have repeatedly proved overly optimistic: the Fund predicted 0.2% growth for the eurozone in 2013, compared to what is likely to be a 0.4% contraction; and it predicted US growth to reach 2.1%, whereas it now appears to have been closer to 1.6%.	事实上，IMF的预测总是过于乐观：它预测今年欧元区能增长0.2 % ， 实际上可能是0.4%的衰退；它预测美国经济能增长2.1 % ， 实际上是近1.6 % 。
With European leaders wedded to austerity and moving at a glacial pace to address the structural problems stemming from the eurozone’s flawed institutional design, it is no wonder that the continent’s prospects appear so bleak.	欧洲领导人纷纷祭出通缩，而纠正欧元区有缺陷的制度设计所造成的结构性问题的速度又极为缓慢，因此欧洲大陆前景如此凄惨并不令人意外。
But, on the other side of the Atlantic, there is cause for muted optimism.	但是，在大西洋另一端，我们有理由保持适度乐观。
Revised data for the US indicate that real GDP grew at an annual pace of 4.1% in the third quarter of 2013, while the unemployment rate finally reached 7% in November – the lowest level in five years.	修正后的美国数据表明2013年前三季度实际GDP增长年率为4.1 % ， 而失业率在11月终于降到了7 % — —五年来的最低水平。
A half-decade of low construction has largely worked off the excess building that occurred during the housing bubble.	五年的低开工数大致消除了房地产泡沫期间产生的过剩建筑。
The development of vast reserves of shale energy has moved America toward its long-sought goal of energy independence and reduced gas prices to record lows, contributing to the first glimmer of a manufacturing revival.	巨量页岩能源储量的开发让美国有望实现长期追求的能源自给目标，也让天然气价格降到了历史最低点，帮助制造业初现复苏曙光。
And a booming high-tech sector has become the envy of the rest of the world.	而繁荣的高技术部门也让世界其他地区艳羡不已。
Most important, a modicum of sanity has been restored to the US political process.	最重要的是，美国政坛也恢复了一点清醒。
Automatic budget cuts – which reduced 2013 growth by as much as 1.75 percentage points from what it otherwise would have been – continue, but in a much milder form.	自动预算削减 — — 它可能让2013年增长降低了1.75个百分点 — — 在继续进行，但比以前温和了许多。
Moreover, the cost curve for health care – a main driver of long-term fiscal deficits – has bent down.	此外，医疗成本曲线 — — 长期财政赤字的主因 — — 也在往下走。
Already, the Congressional Budget Office projects that spending in 2020 for Medicare and Medicaid (the government health-care programs for the elderly and the poor, respectively) will be roughly 15% below the level projected in 2010.	国会预算办公室预测，2020年联邦医疗保险（Medicare）和医疗补助（Medicaid，两者分别是针对老人和穷人的政府医疗计划）支出将2010年所预测的水平低大约15 % 。
It is possible, even likely, that US growth in 2014 will be rapid enough to create more jobs than required for new entrants into the labor force.	有可能，甚至可以说有极大的可能，2014年美国增长速度将能够创造足够的就业岗位容纳劳动力市场新晋大军而有余。
At the very least, the huge number (roughly 22 million) of those who want a full-time job and have been unable to find one should fall.	至少庞大的寻找全职工作而不得的人群（大约2200万人）会有所缩小。
But we should curb our euphoria.	但我们应该克制乐观情绪。
A disproportionate share of the jobs now being created are low-paying – so much so that median incomes (those in the middle) continue to decline.	目前所创造的就业岗位中有很大一部分是低薪职位，以至于中位收入（在收入分配中位于正中）继续下跌。
For most Americans, there is no recovery, with 95% of the gains going to the top 1%.	对大部分美国人来说，根本不存在复苏，95%的利益都流入了最顶层1%手中。
Even before the recession, American-style capitalism was not working for a large share of the population.	即使在衰退前，美国式资本主义已然不利于很大一部分人口。
The recession only made its rough edges more apparent.	衰退只是让这一现象变得清晰可见。
Median income (adjusted for inflation) is still lower than it was in 1989, almost a quarter-century ago; and median income for males is lower than it was four decades ago.	中位收入（经通胀调整后）仍低于近四分之一个世纪前的1989年水平；而男性中位收入更是比四十年前还要低。
America’s new problem is long-term unemployment, which affects nearly 40% of those without jobs, compounded by one of the poorest unemployment-insurance systems among advanced countries, with benefits normally expiring after 26 weeks.	美国的新问题是长期失业，如今这一问题影响着近40%的失业者，而美国的失业保险又是发达国家中最差的，失业救济通常只能领26周。
During downturns, the US Congress extends these benefits, recognizing that individuals are unemployed not because they are not looking for work, but because there are no jobs.	在衰退期间，美国国会扩大了失业救济，认识到个体之所以失业不是因为不找工作，而是因为没有工作可做。
But now congressional Republicans are refusing to adapt the unemployment system to this reality; as Congress went into recess for the holidays, it gave the long-term unemployed the equivalent of a pink slip: as 2014 begins, the roughly 1.3 million Americans who lost their unemployment benefits at the end of December have been left to their own devices.	但如今国会共和党拒绝根据现实调整失业制度，随着国会因假期休会，长期失业者也收到了遗弃通知书：2014年伊始，大约130万在12月底失去失业救济的美国人处于自生自灭的状态。
Happy New Year.	新年快乐。
Meanwhile, a major reason that the US unemployment rate is currently as low as it is, is that so many people have dropped out of the labor force.	与此同时，如今美国失业如此之低的一个主要原因是大量人口退出了劳动力大军。
Labor-force participation is at levels not seen in more than three decades.	劳动力参与率处于三十多年未见的低水平。
Some say that this largely reflects demographics: an increasing share of the working-age population is over 50, and labor-force participation has always been lower among this group than among younger cohorts.	有人说这主要是人口因素造成的：越来越多的工作年龄人口超过了50岁，而该人群的劳动力参与率总是比更年轻人群低。
But this simply recasts the problem: the US economy has never been good at retraining workers.	但这只是换了一个问题：美国经济从来不善于留住员工。
American workers are treated like disposable commodities, tossed aside if and when they cannot keep up with changes in technology and the marketplace.	美国工人就像是可处置的商品，如果不能适应技术和市场的变化就会被扫地出门。
The difference now is that these workers are no longer a small fraction of the population.	现在的区别是，这类工人不再是人口的一小撮。
None of this is inevitable.	所有这些都不是不可避免的。
It is the result of bad economic policy and even worse social policy, which waste the country’s most valuable resource – its human talent – and cause immense suffering for affected individuals and their families.	这是坏经济政策和更坏的社会政策的结果，坏政策浪费了美国最宝贵的资源 — — 人的才能，而受到影响的个人和他们的家庭遭到了严重伤害。
They want to work, but the US economic system is failing them.	他们希望工作，但美国的经济制度让他们工作无望。
So, with Europe’s Great Malaise continuing in 2014 and the US recovery excluding all but those at the top, count me dismal.	因此，看到欧洲带着大问题走进2014年，而美国的复苏只适用于最顶层人群时，我实在是忧郁不可自胜。
On both sides of the Atlantic, market economies are failing to deliver for most citizens.	在大西洋两岸，市场经济没能惠及大部分公民。
How long can this continue?	这一状况会持续多久？
	
The Great Malaise Drags On	大萎靡的拖累
NEW YORK – There’s something dismal about writing year-end roundups in the half-decade since the eruption of the 2008 global financial crisis.	纽约—给2008年爆发的全球金融危机写一个五年总结是令人抑郁的。
Yes, we avoided a Great Depression II, but only to emerge into a Great Malaise, with barely increasing incomes for a large proportion of citizens in advanced economies.	是的，我们避免了大萧条II，但进入了大萎靡（Great Malaise ） ， 发达经济体的大部分人收入几乎没有增长。
We can expect more of the same in 2014.	2014年也将如此。
In the United States, median incomes have continued their seemingly relentless decline; for male workers, income has fallen to levels below those attained more than 40 years ago.	在美国，中位收入继续着残酷的跌势；男性员工的收入水平已经回到了四十年前。
Europe’s double-dip recession ended in 2013, but no one can responsibly claim that recovery has followed.	欧洲的二次探底在2013年结束了，但但凡有点理性的人都不会说随后就能迎来复苏。
More than 50% of young people in Spain and Greece remain unemployed.	西班牙和希腊有一半以上的年轻人仍处于失业状态。
According to the International Monetary Fund, Spain can expect unemployment to be above 25% for years to come.	根据国际货币基金组织（IMF）的数据，西班牙今后几年的失业率预计都将在25%以上。
The real danger for Europe is that a sense of complacency may set in.	欧洲的真正危险在于自满情绪开始涌现。
As the year passed, one could feel the pace of vital institutional reforms in the eurozone slowing.	在今年，我们可以感到欧元区关键的制度性改革节奏正在放慢。
For example, the monetary union needs a real banking union – including not just common supervision, but also common deposit insurance and a common resolution mechanism – and Eurobonds, or some similar vehicle for mutualizing debt.	比如，欧元区需要真正的银行联盟（不仅要有共同监督，也要有共同存款保险和共同清算机制）和欧元债券（或类似的债务共同化机制 ） 。
The eurozone is not much closer to implementing either measure than it was a year ago.	对于这两点，欧元区和一年前相比没有多少进步。
One could also sense a renewed commitment to the austerity policies that incited Europe’s double-dip recession.	你还可以感到把欧洲带入二次探底衰退的紧缩政策又卷土重来了。
Europe’s continuing stagnation is bad enough; but there is still a significant risk of another crisis in yet another eurozone country, if not next year, in the not-too-distant future.	欧洲的持续停滞已经够糟糕的了；但仍有很大的可能在新的欧元区国家爆发新的危机，就算不是明年，恐怕也不会遥远。
Matters are only slightly better in the US, where a growing economic divide – with more inequality than in any other advanced country – has been accompanied by severe political polarization.	美国的情况也只是略好。 在美国，日益严重的经济差距 — — 其不平等程度为发达国家之最 — — 伴随着严重的政治两极分化。
One can only hope that the lunatics in the Republican Party who forced a government shutdown and pushed the country to the brink of default will decide against a repeat performance.	我们只能希望迫使政府关门、让美国走向违约悬崖的共和党狂人们不会一再如此。
But even if they do, the likely contraction from the next round of austerity – which already cost 1-2 percentage points of GDP growth in 2013 – means that growth will remain anemic, barely strong enough to generate jobs for new entrants into the labor force.	但即使他们真的不再如此，新一轮紧缩所可能造成的衰退 — — 目前紧缩已经造成2013年1—2个百分点的GDP增长损失 — — 也意味着增长将继续萎靡，无法创造足够的就业岗位吸收新晋劳动力。
A dynamic tax-avoiding Silicon Valley and a thriving hydrocarbon sector are not enough to offset austerity’s weight.	充满活力的避税硅谷和繁荣的能源部门并不足以抵消紧缩的影响。
Thus, while there may be some reduction of the Federal Reserve’s purchases of long-term assets (so-called quantitative easing, or QE), a move away from rock-bottom interest rates is not expected until 2015 at the earliest.	因此，尽管美联储购买长期资产（所谓的量化宽松，简称QE）的手笔可能有所减小，但利率告别历史低位可能不会遭遇2015年。
Ending low-interest-rates now would not be sensible, though QE has probably benefited the US economy only slightly, and may have raised risks abroad.	现在就结束低利率肯定是不明智的，尽管QE给美国经济带来的好处可能极为有限，在海外还提高了风险。
The tremors in global financial markets set off by discussions earlier in 2013 of tapering QE highlighted the extent of interdependence in the global economy.	2013年早些时候关于逐渐减少QE的讨论引起了全球金融市场动荡，这凸显出全球经济相互依赖的程度。
Just as QE’s introduction fueled currency appreciation, announcing its eventual end triggered depreciation.	正如QE的引入助长了货币升值，宣布其最终结束触发了贬值。
The good news was that most major emerging countries had built up large foreign-exchange reserves and had sufficiently strong economies that they could withstand the shock.	好消息是大部分主要新兴国家建立了庞大的外汇储备和足够强劲的经济，能够抵御冲击。
Still, the growth slowdown in emerging economies was disappointing – all the more so because it is likely to continue through 2014.	尽管如此，新兴经济体的增长放缓令人失望 — — 特别是考虑到2014年可能延续这一趋势。
Each country produced its own story: India’s downturn, for example, was attributed to political problems in New Delhi and a central bank worried about price stability (though there was little reason to believe that raising interest rates would do much about the price of onions and the other items underlying Indian inflation).	每个国家都有每个国家的故事：比如，印度的减速被归因于新德里的政治问题和担心物价稳定的央行（尽管很少有证据证明提高利率能大大影响洋葱和其他决定印度通胀的物品的价格 ） 。
Social unrest in Brazil made it clear that, despite remarkable progress in reducing poverty and inequality over the past decade, the country still has much to do to achieve broadly shared prosperity.	巴西的社会动荡明确地表明，尽管该国在过去十年中在减贫和减少不平等方面取得了令人瞩目的进步，但实现广泛共享的繁荣仍然任重道远。
At the same time, the wave of protest showed the growing political clout of the country’s expanding middle class.	与此同时，示威潮表明巴西崛起的中产阶级政治力量日增。
China’s decelerating growth had a significant impact on commodity prices, and thus on commodity exporters around the world.	中国增长的减速对商品价格形成了严重冲击，全球商品出口国也因此受到影响。
But China’s slowdown needs to be put in perspective: even its lower growth rate is the envy of the rest of the world, and its move toward more sustainable growth, even if at a somewhat lower level, will serve it – and the world – well in the long run.	但中国的减速要真确地予以解读：其减速后的增长率仍然令世界其他国家艳羡，并且正在朝可持续增长迈进（虽然增长水平降低了 ） ， 从长期看，这有利于中国，也有利于世界。
As in previous years, the fundamental problem haunting the global economy in 2013 remained a lack of global aggregate demand.	和前几年一样，2013年困扰全球经济的根本性问题仍然是全球总需求不足。
This does not mean, of course, that there is an absence of real needs – for infrastructure, to take one example, or, more broadly, for retrofitting economies everywhere in response to the challenges of climate change.	当然，这并不意味着缺少真实需求 — — 比如在基础设施方面以及更广泛的调整各国经济以适应气候变化挑战方面。
But the global private financial system seems incapable of recycling the world’s surpluses to meet these needs.	但全球私人金融系统似乎无法利用全球盈余来满足这些需求。
And prevailing ideology prevents us from thinking about alternative arrangements.	而主流思想则阻止了我们考虑其他安排。
We have a global market economy that is not working.	我们的全球市场经济运转出现了问题。
We have unmet needs and underutilized resources.	我们的需求没有得到满足，资源没有得到充分利用。
The system is not delivering benefits for large segments of our societies.	当前体系没有为社会中的许多群体带来好处。
And the prospect of significant improvement in 2014 – or in the foreseeable future – seems unrealistic.	2014年（或者可预见的未来）发生重大改进的可能性也不现实。
At both the national and global levels, political systems seem incapable of introducing the reforms that might create prospects for a brighter future.	不管在国家还是在全球层面，政治制度都不足以引入可以带来更光明的未来前景的改革。
Maybe the global economy will perform a little better in 2014 than it did in 2013, or maybe not.	或许全球经济在2014年会比2013年略有进步，或许不会。
Seen in the broader context of the continuing Great Malaise, both years will come to be regarded as a time of wasted opportunities.	但从持续大萎靡的更广的角度看，今明两年都将被视为浪费机会之年。
	
American Delusions Down Under	美国妄想症贻害无穷
NEW YORK – For better or worse, economic-policy debates in the United States are often echoed elsewhere, regardless of whether they are relevant.	纽约—不管是好是坏，美国经济政策争论常常在未必有关系的别国引起回响。
Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s recently elected government provides a case in point.	澳大利亚总理阿伯特的新当选政府就提供了这样一个例子。
As in many other countries, conservative governments are arguing for cutbacks in government spending, on the grounds that fiscal deficits imperil their future.	和其他许多国家一样，保守派政府认为要削减政府支出，以免财政赤字威胁国家的未来。
In the case of Australia, however, such assertions ring particularly hollow – though that has not stopped Abbott’s government from trafficking in them.	但是，在澳大利亚，这一主张显得特别空洞，但这并没有阻止阿伯特政府推行它。
Even if one accepts the claim of the Harvard economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff that very high public debt levels mean lower growth – a view that they never really established and that has subsequently been discredited – Australia is nowhere near that threshold.	即使你同意哈佛经济学家莱因哈特（Carmen Reinhart）和罗格夫（Kenneth Rogoff ） ， 认为高公债水平意味着低增长 — — 这一观点从来没有真正提出过，并且随后就被推翻了 — — 澳大利亚也远远没有达到阈值水平。
Its debt/GDP ratio is only a fraction of that of the US, and one of the lowest among the OECD countries.	其债务/GDP 之比只有美国的几分之一，为经合组织最低水平之一。
What matters more for long-term growth are investments in the future – including crucial public investments in education, technology, and infrastructure.	影响长期增长的重要因素是未来投资 — — 包括教育、科技和基础设施等方面的关键公共投资。
Such investments ensure that all citizens, no matter how poor their parents, can live up to their potential.	这些投资确保所有公民，不管家庭出身是穷是富，都能实现自己的潜能。
There is something deeply ironic about Abbott’s reverence for the American model in defending many of his government’s proposed “reforms.”	阿伯特奉美国模式为圭臬，顽固坚持他的政府所提出的“改革 ” ， 这看起来相当讽刺。
After all, America’s economic model has not been working for most Americans.	毕竟，美国经济模式对大部分美国人也不灵光。
Median income in the US is lower today than it was a quarter-century ago – not because productivity has been stagnating, but because wages have.	如今，美国中位收入还不如二十五年前 — — 不是因为生产率没有增长，而是因为工资停滞不前。
The Australian model has performed far better.	澳大利亚模式的表现远好于美国。
Indeed, Australia is one of the few commodity-based economies that has not suffered from the natural-resource curse.	事实上，澳大利亚是极少数逃脱自然资源魔咒的大宗商品经济体之一。
Prosperity has been relatively widely shared.	相对而言，其经济增长被广大国民所分享。
Median household income has grown at an average annual rate above 3% in the last decades – almost twice the OECD average.	过去十年中位家庭收入年均增长率超过3 % ， 是经合组织平均水平的近两倍。
To be sure, given its abundance of natural resources, Australia should have far greater equality than it does.	平心而论，考虑到丰富的自然资源，到达利亚的平等性应该更加出色。
After all, a country’s natural resources should belong to all of its people, and the “rents” that they generate provide a source of revenue that could be used to reduce inequality.	毕竟，一国的自然资源应属于全体人民，这些自然资源所产生的“租”提供了可用于降低不平等性的收入。
And taxing natural-resource rents at high rates does not cause the adverse consequences that follow from taxing savings or work (reserves of iron ore and natural gas cannot move to another country to avoid taxation).	而对自然资源租课以高额税率并不会产生对储蓄或工作课税所引起的消极后果（铁矿石和天然气储量不可能为了避税而转移到他国 ） 。
But Australia’s Gini coefficient, a standard measure of inequality, is one-third higher than that of Norway, a resource-rich country that has done a particularly good job of managing its wealth for the benefit of all citizens.	但澳大利亚的基尼系数（衡量不平等程度的指标）比挪威高三分之一。 同为资源丰富国的挪威在管理国家财富以使全民受益方面做得非常出色。
One wonders whether Abbott and his government really understand what has happened in the US?	你或许会感到奇怪，阿伯特及其政府真的明白美国发生了什么吗？
Does he realize that since the era of deregulation and liberalization began in the late 1970s, GDP growth has slowed markedly, and that what growth has occurred has primarily benefited those at the top?	他意识到自20世纪79年代末开始去监管化和自由化以来，GDP增长显著放缓，并且增长果实主要被最顶尖人群攫取了吗？
Does he know that prior to these “reforms,” the US had not had a financial crisis – now a regular occurrence around the world – for a half-century, and that deregulation led to a bloated financial sector that attracted many talented young people who otherwise might have devoted their careers to more productive activities?	他知道在这些“改革”之前，美国已有半个世纪没有经历过金融危机（眼下金融危机倒成了全球范围内见怪不怪之事了 ） ， 并且去监管化导致了金融部门不断坐大、吸引了本应将职业生涯贡献给生产率更高的活动的年轻才俊吗？
Their financial innovations made them extremely rich but brought America and the global economy to the brink of ruin.	他们的金融创新给自己带来了巨富，但却将美国和全球经济推向了毁灭边缘。
Australia’s public services are the envy of the world.	澳大利亚的公共服务令全世界艳羡。
Its health-care system delivers better outcomes than the US, at a fraction of the cost.	其医疗体系比美国效果更好，而成本只有美国的几分之一。
It has an income-contingent education-loan program that permits borrowers to spread their repayments over more years if necessary, and in which, if their income turns out to be particularly low (perhaps because they chose important but low-paying jobs, say, in education or religion), the government forgives some of the debt.	澳大利亚拥有基于收入的教育贷款机制，允许借款人在必要时延长还款年限，如果他们的收入非常低（也许是因为他们选择了重要但低薪的工作，如教育或宗教方面的工作 ） ， 政府还可以豁免一些债务。
The contrast with the US is striking.	澳大利亚与美国可谓对比鲜明。
In the US, student debt, now in excess of $1.2 trillion (more than all credit-card debt), is becoming a burden for graduates and the economy.	在美国，学生债务目前已超1.2万亿美元（比信用卡债务还要高 ） ， 成为毕业生和经济的一大负担。
America’s failed financial model for higher education is one of the reasons that, among the advanced countries, America now has the least equality of opportunity, with the life prospects of a young American more dependent on his or her parents’ income and education than in other advanced countries.	美国的机会平等状况在发达国家中垫底，与其他发达国家相比，美国年轻人的生活前景更多地取决于父母亲的收入和教育，之所以如此，失败的高等教育金融模式难辞其咎。
Abbott’s notions about higher education also suggest that he clearly does not understand why America’s best universities succeed.	阿伯特的高等教育观也表明，他完全不知道为什么美国顶尖大学能获得成功。
It is not price competition or the drive for profit that has made Harvard, Yale, or Stanford great.	让哈佛、耶鲁和斯坦福名垂世界的并不是价格竞争或逐利。
None of America’s great universities are for-profit-institutions.	美国顶尖大学都不是营利组织。
They are all not-for-profit institutions, either public or supported by large endowments, contributed largely by alumni and foundations.	它们都是非盈利组织，或者是公立学校，或者拥有庞大的捐赠（主要来自校友和基金会 ） 。
There is competition, but of a different sort.	竞争是存在的，但是另一种竞争。
They strive for inclusiveness and diversity.	美国顶尖大学竞争的是包容性和多样性。
They compete for government research grants.	它们竞争政府研究补助。
America’s under-regulated for-profit universities excel in two dimensions: the ability to exploit young people from poor backgrounds, charging them high fees without delivering anything of value, and the ability to lobby for government money without regulation and to continue their exploitative practices.	美国不受监管的盈利性大学在两方面很在行：一是剥削出身贫寒的年轻人，向他们征收高额学费，而提供的教学内容毫无价值；二是游说政府给它们不受监管的拨款，继续从事剥削行动。
Australia should be proud of its successes, from which the rest of the world can learn a great deal.	澳大利亚应该为它的成功而骄傲，世界其他国家能够从澳大利亚身上学到很多教益。
It would be a shame if a misunderstanding of what has happened in the US, combined with a strong dose of ideology, caused its leaders to fix what is not broken.	不能理解美国所发生的事情而又被意识形态所蒙蔽，以至于其领导人向根本不必纠正之处开刀，这将是澳大利亚之祸。
	
Europe’s Austerity Zombies	欧洲的紧缩僵尸
NEW YORK – “If the facts don’t fit the theory, change the theory,” goes the old adage.	纽约 — “ 如果事实和理论不符，那么就改理论 ， ” 老话如是说。
But too often it is easier to keep the theory and change the facts – or so German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other pro-austerity European leaders appear to believe.	但往往保持理论改变事实才更容易 — — 或者说，德国总理默克尔和其他支持紧缩的欧洲领导人是这么认为的。
Though facts keep staring them in the face, they continue to deny reality.	尽管频繁被事实打脸，他们仍拒绝接受现实。
Austerity has failed.	紧缩失败了。
But its defenders are willing to claim victory on the basis of the weakest possible evidence: the economy is no longer collapsing, so austerity must be working!	但紧缩的辩护者仍要以极其脆弱的证据宣布胜利“经济不再崩溃，因此一定是紧缩见效了！
But if that is the benchmark, we could say that jumping off a cliff is the best way to get down from a mountain; after all, the descent has been stopped.	但如果以此为准，我们可以说跳下悬崖是最好的下山方式；毕竟，下坡之势被止住了。
But every downturn comes to an end.	但所有的衰退总有重点。
Success should not be measured by the fact that recovery eventually occurs, but by how quickly it takes hold and how extensive the damage caused by the slump.	成功不能用复苏终于发生这一事实来衡量，而应该用复苏多快、衰退创造的伤害多大来衡量。
Viewed in these terms, austerity has been an utter and unmitigated disaster, which has become increasingly apparent as European Union economies once again face stagnation, if not a triple-dip recession, with unemployment persisting at record highs and per capita real (inflation-adjusted) GDP in many countries remaining below pre-recession levels.	从这些标准看，紧缩是一场彻头彻尾的灾难。 我们日益明确地看到，欧盟经济体再次面临着停滞甚至三次探底，失业高居创纪录的水平，许多国家的人均真实（经通胀调整的） GDP仍低于衰退前水平。
In even the best-performing economies, such as Germany, growth since the 2008 crisis has been so slow that, in any other circumstance, it would be rated as dismal.	即使在德国等表现最好的经济体，2008年以来的增长也变得非常缓慢，若是换作其他时期，只能用凄凉来形容。
The most afflicted countries are in a depression.	受冲击最大的国家则陷入了萧条。
There is no other word to describe an economy like that of Spain or Greece, where nearly one in four people – and more than 50% of young people – cannot find work.	除此之外你找不到其他词汇来形容西班牙和希腊的经济了 — — 每四个人中就有一个无法找到工作，年轻人的这一比例更是超过50 % 。
To say that the medicine is working because the unemployment rate has decreased by a couple of percentage points, or because one can see a glimmer of meager growth, is akin to a medieval barber saying that a bloodletting is working, because the patient has not died yet.	说解药正在起效，因为失业率下降了几个百分点或者能够看到一丁点儿微弱的增长迹象，就好比是中世纪理发师宣布放血疗法起了效果，因为病人还没有死一样。
Extrapolating Europe’s modest growth from 1980 onwards, my calculations show that output in the eurozone today is more than 15% below where it would have been had the 2008 financial crisis not occurred, implying a loss of some $1.6 trillion this year alone, and a cumulative loss of more than $6.5 trillion.	从1980年以来欧洲温和增长出发，我测算今天的欧元区产出比2008年不发生金融危机的情形要低15%以上，这意味着光是在今年，损失就高达1.6万亿美元，累计损失则超过6.5万亿美元。
Even more disturbing, the gap is widening, not closing (as one would expect following a downturn, when growth is typically faster than normal as the economy makes up lost ground).	更令人担忧的是，这一缺口还在扩大而不是缩小（按理说缺口应该减小，因为随着经济收复失地，增长通常要快于常态 ） 。
Simply put, the long recession is lowering Europe’s potential growth.	简言之，长期衰退正在拖累欧洲的潜在增长。
Young people who should be accumulating skills are not.	理应积累技能的年轻人没有这样做。
There is overwhelming evidence that they face the prospect of significantly lower lifetime income than if they had come of age in a period of full employment.	压倒性证据表明，与充分就业时期进入劳动力市场的轻型相比，他们面临着显著更低的终身收入。
Meanwhile, Germany is forcing other countries to follow policies that are weakening their economies – and their democracies.	与此同时，德国正在强迫其他国家跟进削弱经济 — — 以及民主的政策。
When citizens repeatedly vote for a change of policy – and few policies matter more to citizens than those that affect their standard of living – but are told that these matters are determined elsewhere or that they have no choice, both democracy and faith in the European project suffer.	如果公民一再将选票投给政策变革 — — 并且很难找出比影响人民生活水平的政策对人民的影响更大的政策了 — — 却被告知此事由其他国家决定，他们别无选择，那么民主和对欧洲工程的信任都将遭到打击。
France voted to change course three years ago.	三年前，法国人把选票投给了改变道路。
Instead, voters have been given another dose of pro-business austerity.	但他们得到的却是又一波有利于商业的紧缩。
One of the longest-standing propositions in economics is the balanced-budget multiplier – increasing taxes and expenditures in tandem stimulates the economy.	经济学中历史最悠久的一个理论是平衡预算乘数 — — 同时增加税收和支出能刺激经济。
And if taxes target the rich, and spending targets the poor, the multiplier can be especially high.	而如果课税目标是富人而支出目标是穷人，该乘数将非常大。
But France’s so-called socialist government is lowering corporate taxes and cutting expenditures – a recipe almost guaranteed to weaken the economy, but one that wins accolades from Germany.	但法国的所谓社会主义（socialist）政府却在降低公司税、削减支出 — — 这一组合几乎肯定会削弱经济，但它得到了德国的赞扬。
The hope is that lower corporate taxes will stimulate investment.	人们寄希望于更低的公司税能刺激投资。
This is sheer nonsense.	纯属无稽之谈。
What is holding back investment (both in the United States and Europe) is lack of demand, not high taxes.	拖累投资（不管在美国还是在欧洲）的是缺少需求，而不是高税率。
Indeed, given that most investment is financed by debt, and that interest payments are tax-deductible, the level of corporate taxation has little effect on investment.	事实上，由于大部分投资通过债务融资，而利息偿付可以抵扣应税项目，因此公司税水平对投资几乎没有影响。
Likewise, Italy is being encouraged to accelerate privatization.	类似地，意大利被鼓励加快私有化。
But Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has the good sense to recognize that selling national assets at fire-sale prices makes little sense.	但总理伦齐明智地认识到以跳楼价出售国家资产无济于事。
Long-run considerations, not short-run financial exigencies, should determine which activities occur in the private sector.	长期考虑而不是短期金融之急才是决定私人部门行为的因素。
The decision should be based on where activities are carried out most efficiently, serving the interests of most citizens the best.	决策应该基于哪些活动效率最高、最能符合大多数人民的利益。
Privatization of pensions, for example, has proved costly in those countries that have tried the experiment.	比如，试水养老金私有化的国家无不发现代价沉重。
America’s mostly private health-care system is the least efficient in the world.	美国的医疗体系私有化程度最高，但效率堪称全世界最低。
These are hard questions, but it is easy to show that selling state-owned assets at low prices is not a good way to improve long-run financial strength.	这些问题很困难，但很容易看到，低价出售国有资产不是改善长期金融健康的好办法。
All of the suffering in Europe – inflicted in the service of a man-made artifice, the euro – is even more tragic for being unnecessary.	更加悲剧的是，欧洲的所有苦难 — — 为了有利于人为造成的阴谋欧盟服务 — — 根本毫无必要。
Though the evidence that austerity is not working continues to mount, Germany and the other hawks have doubled down on it, betting Europe’s future on a long-discredited theory.	尽管紧缩没有奏效的证据一天比一天多，但德国和其他鹰派仍在加倍下注，根据早已站不住脚的理论赌欧洲的未来。
Why provide economists with more facts to prove the point?	为什么还要为经济学家提供更多事实证明这一点呢？
	
Rethinking Pharmaceutical Business Models	反思医药商业模式
ZURICH – The world’s health needs are changing dramatically.	苏黎世 — — 世界健康需求正在发生着巨大的改变。
Demographic trends, shifting patterns of disease, and strained public funding are placing new burdens on health-care systems.	人口趋势、不断变化的疾病模式和紧张的公共资源正在给医疗卫生系统造成新的负担。
For developed and developing countries alike, the new demands cannot be met if health care continues to operate in the same way.	发达国家和发展中国家一样，如果继续以原有模式运营医疗保健行业将无法满足新的需求。
What is required are new business models that spread risks, take a broader view of health, and address the needs of the world’s poorest people.	这就需要全新商业模式来分散风险、从更广阔的视角看待医疗卫生行业并满足全世界贫困民众的需求。
Demographic changes will present significant challenges for countries’ long-term health planning.	人口结构改变将为各国长期健康规划带来重大的挑战。
By 2050, the number of people worldwide who are 60 or older will exceed the number of children under 15.	到2050年，全世界60岁以上人口的数量将超过 15岁以下儿童。
Moreover, an additional three billion people will join the global middle class over the next two decades, altering the types of health issues that countries will face, and the way health care is financed.	此外，今后二十年内还将有三十亿人进入全球中产阶级行列，从而改变国家面临的健康问题和医疗保健的资金来源。
At the same time, non-communicable diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes, are rising, while previously deadly conditions, such as HIV/AIDS, are now more treatable and have been deemed chronic diseases.	同时，癌症、心脏疾病、糖尿病等非传染性疾病愈演愈烈，而HIV/艾滋病等曾经的致命疾病因为已经可以得到治疗而成为新的慢性病。
Keeping up with these changes would be difficult in the best of times.	即使在黄金时期适应这样的变化也非常困难。
But a stagnant global economy is straining health-care budgets to the breaking point.	但停滞不前的全球经济正将医疗保健预算推向崩溃的边缘。
Governments, insurers, and other health-care payers are becoming ever more concerned about getting value for money.	政府、保险公司和其他为医疗保健业掏钱的人对性价比的关注度正越来越高。
In response, pharmaceutical companies and policymakers are looking for innovative ways to reduce these pressures, not just by developing new drugs, but also by rethinking how the industry operates.	因此，制药公司和决策者都在探索新方法来缓解压力，其中不仅涉及新药研发，还涉及对行业运营方式的重新思考。
My company, for one, has tested three business models that have shown encouraging results.	比方说我公司就已经试验了三种商业模式并取得了令人鼓舞的成果。
One involves risk sharing, in which the user pays for the drug only if his treatment turns out to be successful.	其中一种涉及到风险分担机制，只有治疗见效的患者才需要支付药品费用。
If it is not, the pharmaceutical company refunds the cost.	反之制药公司将接受退款。
We have used risk-sharing programs in Germany, where we cooperate with two major payers on the pricing for Aclasta, an osteoporosis treatment.	我们已经在德国执行了风险分担计划，与两家重要支付主体就治疗骨质疏松药物密固达的定价进行了合作。
If a patient suffers a bone fracture after treatment (signifying that the drug has not worked), Novartis repays the cost.	如果患者治疗后发生骨折（这显示该药没起作用 ） ， 那么诺华公司需要将收取的款项退还给患者。
The payer benefits from this system, because risk sharing minimizes the cost of failure.	付费方从这一体制中受益，因为风险分担最大限度地降低了失败的成本。
The pharmaceutical firm gains as well, because the effective guarantee underpins public confidence in its products.	制药企业同样也是赢家，因为有效保障增强了公众对其产品的信心。
The risk-sharing model has limitations, though.	但风险分担模式亦有其局限性。
Some payers find that the system is too complex, especially when trying to define a successful outcome, and that they must wait too long for refunds.	有些付费方发现这项制度尤其在确定治疗是否成功时显得过于复杂，而且他们要等太长时间才能拿到退款。
Nevertheless, risk sharing is a good starting point from which to develop a fairer and more efficient business model – and one that can be refined or simplified over time.	尽管如此，风险分担仍不失为一个制��公平有效商业模式的不错起点 — — 这一模式可以随着时间推移逐步得到细化或简化。
A second business model brings patients, payers, and health-care professionals together to provide an integrated program to complement treatment for a specific illness.	第二种商业模式让患者、付费方和医疗专业人士合作建立补充治疗特定疾病的医疗计划。
In Brazil, for example, our Vale Mais Saúde program uses this approach to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a potentially fatal lung condition forecast to be the world’s third biggest killer by 2030.	以巴西为例，我们的Vale Mais Saúde医疗计划利用这种方法来治疗慢性阻塞性肺病（COPD ） ， 有预测认为这种潜在的致命肺病到2030年可能成为世界第三大杀手。
In addition to providing Onbrez Breezhaler, a daily treatment to improve lung function in COPD patients, the program provides a comprehensive treatment package covering all symptoms.	除提供改善慢性肺阻塞患者肺功能的日常治疗外，该计划还针对所有症状提供一揽子治疗。
Patients can receive discounted flu vaccines, nicotine replacement therapies, help in enrolling in pulmonary rehabilitation sessions, and health information sent to their homes.	患者能够以折扣价得到流感疫苗、接受尼古丁替代疗法、报名听取肺部康复课程并获得上门健康信息服务。
These interventions alleviate symptoms, prevent other illnesses from exacerbating them, and help patients continue their normal daily activities.	这些干预措施能够缓解症状，防止其他疾病导致症状加剧，并帮助患者延续正常的日常活动。
But it is in the poorest countries with the least developed health-care systems and weakest infrastructure that new business models are needed the most.	但最需要全新商业模式的恰恰是医疗保健制度最落后、基础设施也最薄弱的贫困国家。
In the past, corporate philanthropy has gone some way to help, but such an approach is neither sustainable nor scalable.	过去，企业慈善在这方面做过一些有益的尝试，但这种方法既不可持续也很难推广。
If companies are to make a significant difference, they must find ways to work with existing health-care systems over the long term.	如果公司要想取得显著变化，他们必须找到长期适应现有医疗保健制度的方法。
One way to do this is through social ventures.	一种方法是通过社会企业。
For example, our Arogya Parivar (or “Healthy Family”) program reaches millions of India’s poorest citizens.	比方说，我们的Arogya Parivar（即“健康家庭 ” ） 计划服务于数百万最贫困的印度民众。
It is organized around four principles: awareness, acceptability, availability, and adaptability.	这项计划的基石是宣传、接受性、有效性和适应性。
Arogya Parivar raises general public awareness of health issues by training educators to teach disease prevention and treatment in villages, helping some 2.5 million rural inhabitants in 2012 alone.	Arogya Parivar计划通过开展农村疾病预防治疗教育培训培养公众健康意识，仅2012年一年就为250万农村居民提供了帮助。
The program reaches more than 45,000 local doctors through a network of 90 medical distributors, ensuring that medicines are available in 28,000 of India’s remotest pharmacies.	该计划通过下属90家医疗分销商网络覆盖超过45,000名当地医生，确保为28,000家印度最偏远的药房提供药物。
To ensure affordability, especially to those on a daily wage, we sell smaller, over-the-counter doses.	为保证普通百姓，尤其是工薪阶层能买得起药，我们出售小包装非处方药物。
The program is also flexible, adapting medicines, packaging, and training according to the different health and cultural needs of India’s diverse communities.	这项计划也相当灵活，根据印度不同群体的健康和文化需求来调整药品、包装和培训内容。
These three examples demonstrate that, with innovative thinking, we can meet the world’s changing health needs.	这三个例子表明通过创新思维，我们能够满足全球不断变化的健康需求。
Pharmaceutical companies are doing what they can – but they need help.	制药企业都在竭尽全力，但他们需要帮助。
Most important, governments, payers, and physicians must come together to test, support, and roll out the best and most cost-effective ideas.	最重要的是，政府、支付公司和医生必须同心协力，试验、支持并推广性价比最高的优秀理念。
Only then can we improve the health of all people, rich and poor alike, regardless of where they live.	这样我们才能改善全民健康状况，不管他们在哪里生活，也不管他们是穷是富。
	
A Healthier, Wealthier Africa	更健康、更富有的非洲
ZURICH – The BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) have long been the focus of emerging-market investors.	苏黎世—金砖四国（巴西、俄罗斯、印度和中国）一直是新兴市场投资者关注的焦点。
But it is in Africa, a region with the world’s second-fastest growth, where the next big business opportunities lie.	但增长速度位居世界第二的非洲地区才是下一个大商业机会的所在地。
In about one-third of the continent’s 55 countries, annual GDP growth is above 6%, and Sub-Saharan Africa grew at an estimated 5.1% pace in 2013.	非洲大陆55个国家中有大约三分之一年GDP增长率超过6 % ， 2013年撒哈拉以南非洲地区预计增长率为5.1 % 。
Foreign investors report that their return on investment in Africa is higher than in any other emerging region.	外国投资者报告其在非洲的投资回报率比其他任何新兴地区都要高。
By 2040, the continent’s working-age population will total an estimated 1.1 billion people, providing businesses with a larger labor pool than even China or India.	到2040年，非洲大陆的工作适龄人口预计将达到11亿人，成为比中国和印度更大的劳动力储备大军。
Moreover, economic expansion is taking place not just in urban centers, but in small towns and villages as well.	此外，经济扩张并不局限于城市中心，小村镇也在增长。
However, Africa also faces major challenges.	但是，非洲也面临着重大挑战。
One of the biggest concerns is inadequate health care.	最大的担忧之一是医疗不足。
Preventable and treatable diseases plague the population.	可预防和可治愈疾病困扰着大量人口。
Life expectancy is 14 years below the global average.	非洲预期寿命比全球平均水平低14岁。
Nearly one in 20 adults in the 15-49 age group in Sub-Saharan Africa lives with HIV – roughly six times the global average.	撒哈拉以南非洲地区的15—49岁年龄段人口中每20人就有一人携带艾滋病毒 — — 大概是全球水平的六倍。
Every minute, an African child dies from malaria.	每一分钟都有一名非洲儿童死于疟疾。
Africa’s rapid economic growth and urbanization are also creating new health challenges.	非洲的快速经济增长和城市化也在造成新的健康挑战。
Non-communicable diseases are projected to become the most common causes of death by 2030.	据估计，到2030年，非传染性疾病将成为最大的死因。
The number of diabetes cases, for example, is expected nearly to double over the next two decades.	比如，糖尿病人数量预计会在未来二十年里翻一番。
If left unaddressed, the dual burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases could jeopardize Africa’s economic potential.	如果放任问题发展，传染性和非传染性疾病的双重压力可能压垮非洲的经济潜力。
To avoid this, three critical areas of health care must be addressed: technology, infrastructure, and education.	为了避免这一幕，必须解决好医疗领域的三个关键问题：技术、基础设施和教育。
Africa has witnessed some remarkable technological leaps.	非洲已经有了一些令人瞩目的技术进步。
A decade ago, telecoms infrastructure was almost non-existent.	十年前，通信基础设施基本上不存在。
Today, one in six people owns a mobile phone, the benefits of which go far beyond easy communication.	如今，每六个人就拥有一部移动电话，移动电话带来的好处远远不止于通信的便捷。
Africa has pioneered the use of mobile banking, with local players like M-Pesa and global corporations like Citi demonstrating how new technology can provide vital financial services to the unbanked population.	非洲是移动银行的先锋，M-Pesa等本地公司和花旗银行等跨国公司证明了新技术可以为无法接触到银行的人口提供至关重要的金融服务。
Mobile money and digital wallets accessed on cellphones eliminate the need for physical cash in rural areas, where financial services are limited and carrying large amounts of cash is risky.	可以通过手机操作的移动支付和数字钱包消除了在农村地区携带实体现金的需要。 由于金融服务的缺乏，在非洲农村地区携带大笔现金是很危险的。
Joining this mobile-phone revolution, Novartis is working with five African governments and private-sector partners to improve drug distribution and monitor the supply of anti-malaria medicines in rural areas, using text messaging and electronic mapping.	诺华制药公司也加入了这场移动电话革命，与五个非洲国家的政府和私人部门合作使用手机短信和电子地图改善药品分销和监测疟疾药物在农村地区的供应情况。
Previously, patients would travel to distant health clinics only to find that the medicines that they needed were no longer in stock.	此前，病人必须长途跋涉前往诊所买药，并且时常遇到所需药品没有库存的情况。
Now, thanks to the SMS for Life project, vital medicines can be quickly redistributed to where they are most needed.	如今，有了“生命短信 ” （ SMS for Life）项目的支持，关键药品可以迅速地分配给最需要的地区。
A second crucial aspect of improving Africa’s health care is infrastructure.	改善非洲健康状况的第二个关键领域是基础设施。
Good rail lines, roads, and ports allow products and services to be distributed widely at lower cost, and to benefit from economies of scale.	良好的铁路、公路和港口能让产品和服务以低廉的成本得到广泛的分销，并能获得规模经济带来的好处。
This is an essential component of any country’s economic development.	这对于任何一个国家的经济发展来说都是必不可少的。
And nowhere are the benefits more evident than in the provision of health care.	而非洲更是从医疗供���中获益最大的地区。
Fortunately, several companies are rising to the challenge.	幸运的是，一些公司正在应对这一挑战。
Coca-Cola, for example, is contributing its supply-chain expertise to map out health facilities and implement stock-management software to support the distribution of bed nets, contraceptives, anti-AIDS drugs, and vaccines to remote villages.	比如，可口可乐正在改善其供应链的专业水平，优化医疗设施布局，改善库存管理软件，从而支持面向偏远村庄的蚊帐、避孕药、艾滋病治疗药和疫苗的分配。
Meanwhile, Novartis is piloting a “social venture” business model to give poor people in remote villages access to vital medicines that are packaged in small, affordable doses.	与此同时，诺华制药公司正在试验一套“社会创业”模式，让偏远村庄的穷人也能获得廉价的小包装必须药物。
Finally, education is one of the most powerful tools for reducing poverty and generating sustainable, inclusive economic growth.	最后，教育是消除贫困、产生可持续的包容性经济增长的最有力的武器。
But, given limited resources and few teachers, too many children are being left behind.	但是，由于教育和教师资源的局限，太多儿童输在了起跑线上。
Public-private partnerships are helping to change this.	公私合作正在改变这一状况。
The IT company Cisco, for example, works with NGOs to connect communities and help students develop skills in information and communications technology.	比如，IT行业的思科公司与非政府组织合作建立了社区之间的联系并帮助学生发展信息和通信技术方面的技能。
Poor education also affects health.	拙劣的教育也影响健康。
Although Africa accounts for one-seventh of the world’s population, it bears one-quarter of the global disease burden, yet has a mere 2% of the world’s doctors.	尽管非洲拥有世界七分之一的人口，但却承受了全球四分之一的疾病负担，只拥有全世界2%的医生。
Unsurprisingly, many health problems stem from ignorance about diseases and basic hygiene.	毫不奇怪，许多健康问题源自对疾病和基本卫生知识的无知。
So Novartis has formed a partnership with the Earth Institute, the United Nations, and private-sector groups to train and deploy by 2015 a million community health workers in Sub-Saharan Africa to deliver basic treatment and preventive care, and to track disease outbreaks.	因此，诺华制药公司与地球研究所（Earth Institute ） 、 联合国和私人部门集团建立了合作伙伴关系，致力于到2015年在撒哈拉以南非洲地区培训和部署一百万社区健康工作者提供基本治疗和预防措施并追踪疾病的爆发。
The idea is that local people will learn how to support their communities, rather than rely on handouts, and thereby lift themselves out of poverty permanently.	这一方案的构想是让本地人学到如何支持他们的社区，而不是依赖宣传，从而让他们本身永远摆脱贫困。
Africa is increasingly showing signs of its promise, but innovative solutions to improve its people’s health are essential if the continent is to approach its potential.	非洲正在日益显示出未来的活力，但如果这片大陆要实现它的潜力，就必须有创新型方案来改善其人民的健康。
This will require more than philanthropy: it will demand new commercial models that solve health-care issues, help the economy to grow, and benefit those who invest in Africa’s future.	这不光光是慈善问题：这需要新的商业模式来解决健康问题、刺激经济增长并让投资非洲未来的人获益。
	
Putin’s Calculus	普京的如意算盘
CAMBRIDGE – By most accounts, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been the winner in the Ukraine crisis, at least so far.	坎布里奇 — — 多数人认为至少到目前为止，俄罗斯总统普京一直是乌克兰危机的赢家。
His annexation of Crimea, which Nikita Khrushchev arbitrarily transferred to Ukraine in 1954, has been widely applauded at home, and he has largely shrugged off Western governments’ responses.	他吞并1954年赫鲁晓夫强制移交给乌克兰的克里米亚的举动在国内赢得了广泛赞誉，他也在很大程度上对西方政府的反应嗤之以鼻。
But, from a longer-term perspective, Putin’s victory is not quite so certain.	但从更长远的角度来看，普京能否取得最终胜利仍然是未知数。
The current crisis in Ukraine began with President Viktor Yanukovych’s decision to reject a European Union Association Agreement, opting instead for a deal with Russia that included desperately needed financing.	乌克兰目前这场危机始于维克托·亚努科维奇总统拒绝签署欧盟联合协议，转而选择与俄罗斯签订包括其迫切需要的融资条款在内的协议的决策。
This outraged Ukrainians in the country’s more pro-EU western regions, spurring protracted popular protests that ultimately toppled Yanukovych’s corrupt but democratically elected government.	此举激怒了亲欧盟西部地区的乌克兰人，引发了长时间的民众抗议活动，最终推翻了虽由民主选举产生但却腐败的亚努科维奇政府。
But not all Ukrainians were averse to pursuing closer ties with Russia.	但并非所有乌克兰人都不愿与俄罗斯建立更紧密的关系。
Indeed, Yanukovych’s decision pleased many Russian speakers in Ukraine’s eastern and southern regions.	实际上，乌克兰东部和南部众多讲俄语的民众对亚努科维奇的决策非常满意。
And it was to Russia that Yanukovych turned when, after months of peaceful demonstrations in Kyiv, violence broke out and demonstrators were killed, spurring him to flee Ukraine.	亚努科维奇在基辅长达数月的和平示威引发暴力活动并打死示威者后逃离乌克兰向俄罗斯求助。
For his part, Putin not only provided sanctuary for Yanukovych and refused to recognize the new government in Kyiv; he began to help organize – and incite – resistance among Crimea’s ethnic Russian majority.	普京不仅为亚努科维奇提供庇护，而且拒绝承认基辅新政府；他开始协助组织 — — 和煽动 — — 克里米亚主要民族俄罗斯族的抵抗运动。
By deploying Russian troops (often masked and without insignias) from the Black Sea Fleet’s base in Sevastopol, which Russia had leased from Ukraine, Putin was able to take control of the peninsula with no loss of life.	普京从向乌克兰租借的塞瓦斯托波尔黑海舰队基地部署俄军（往往并不佩戴俄军标识 ） ， 不费一兵一卒就掌握了对半岛的控制。
When Western leaders expressed outrage over the forced changes to European borders, Putin remained unfazed, citing NATO’s use of force in Kosovo 15 years ago, and their subsequent support for its formal secession from Serbia, as an example of their hypocrisy.	当西方领导人表达对俄国强制改变欧洲边界的愤慨时，普京丝毫不为所动，他援引15年前北约在科索沃动武及其后支持科索沃正式脱离塞尔维亚的例子，来证明北约的虚伪性。
The West shot back with targeted sanctions against a few high-level Russian officials, to which Putin responded with sanctions of his own, barring entry to selected Western politicians.	西方国家实施了���某些俄罗斯高官的针对性制裁，而普京则以禁止某些西方政客进入俄罗斯的制裁措施回敬。
All in all, a few Russian banks have had their accounts frozen; some shipments of sensitive goods have been halted; and the ruble and the Russian stock market have suffered losses.	总之，有几家俄国银行的账户遭到了冻结；某些批次的敏感货物停运；卢布和俄罗斯股市也遭受了损失。
But the overall impact of the West’s response has been moderate.	但西方制裁措施产生的影响相对温和。
The West’s reluctance to intensify sanctions stems largely from European countries that retain strong economic ties with Russia.	西方不愿加大制裁力度主要因为某些欧洲国家与俄国有着很强的经济联系。
While the United States – which trades little with Russia – and the EU have vowed to develop a framework for additional sanctions, to be activated if Putin sends forces into eastern Ukraine, designing them in a way that does not hurt Europe will not be easy.	虽然对俄贸易稀少的美国会同欧盟发誓要制定进一步制裁框架并在普京派军进入东乌克兰的情况下予以实施，但要找到不损害欧洲利益的制裁方法其实并不容易。
Nonetheless, Russia has paid a high price for its actions in terms of its international standing.	尽管如此，俄国在国际地位方面付出了惨重的代价。
The goodwill and soft power generated by the Sochi Olympics were immediately depleted, and Russia has now been all but expelled from the G-8.	索契冬奥会带来的声誉和软实力即刻烟消云散，俄国目前就差被八国集团赶出门去。
In the United Nations General Assembly, Russia had to face an embarrassing vote in which 100 countries condemned its actions.	俄罗斯被迫在联大面临一轮尴尬的投票，有100个国家对它的行为表示谴责。
And, at the end of the nuclear security summit in The Hague, US President Barack Obama cited Russia as a regional power whose aggressive policies toward its neighbors displayed weakness.	而且在海牙核安全峰会结束时，美国总统奥巴马公开表示俄罗斯身为地区强国对邻国采取的激进政策将其弱点暴露在光天化日之下。
Does any of this matter to Putin?	这些措施普京究竟在不在意？
The answer depends on what his objectives are.	答案取决于他的目的到底是什么。
If, as some observers claim, Putin’s aggressive actions stem from feelings of insecurity, he has had mixed success.	如果真如某些观察家所言是内心的不安全感造成了普京的侵略，那么他的成败很难说得清楚。
By this account, Putin feared diminished influence in a neighboring country with which Russia shares deep historical ties.	按照这种解释，普京害怕在与俄有深刻历史渊源的国家降低影响力。
But, despite Russia’s obvious influence among eastern Ukraine’s Russophones, the overall impact of the annexation of Crimea has been to reduce Russia’s influence in the country, while reinvigorating Putin’s bête noire, NATO.	但尽管俄国对东乌克兰俄罗斯族的影响显而易见，但吞并克里米亚总体而言导致俄罗斯对乌克兰的影响力降低，而且还重新激起了北约对普京的厌恶情绪。
Putin may also have worried that a successful revolution in Ukraine might encourage a revival of the protests that caused him so much trouble in 2012, when he re-assumed the presidency from Dmitri Medvedev.	普京或许还担心乌克兰革命成功可能重新激起抗议活动，类似活动曾在2012年他从梅德韦杰夫手中接任总统时给他带来过很多问题。
In the wake of his annexation of Crimea, Putin’s domestic approval rating has soared, and the chances that any protest would succeed in genuinely undercutting – much less toppling – his administration are very low.	吞并克里米亚后普京的国内支持率飙升，任何抗议活动真正破坏 — — 更不用说推翻其政府的可能性非常之低。
Others claim that Putin’s primary motivation was to restore Russia’s global “great power” status.	还有人认为恢复俄国的全球“大国”地位才是普京的主要目的。
After all, Putin, a former KGB agent in East Germany, has lamented the Soviet Union’s dissolution as “the greatest geopolitical disaster of the twentieth century.”	毕竟普京曾经是东德的克格勃特工，他曾感叹苏联解体是“二十世纪最大的地缘政治灾难 ” 。
In fact, Putin often has been described as angry with the West, beset by a sense of betrayal and humiliation from what he perceives as unfair treatment of Russia.	事实上，有人说普京对西方怀着满腔愤怒，因为俄罗斯遭受不公平待遇而感觉遭到背叛和羞辱。
For Putin, gestures like including Russia in the G-8, the G-20, and the World Trade Organization, and inviting a Russian ambassador to NATO discussions in Brussels, could not make up for NATO’s expansion to Russia’s borders, the placement of anti-ballistic missile sites in Eastern Europe, or the dismemberment of Serbia.	在普京看来，邀请俄国加入八国集团、二十国集团、世贸组织、以及邀请俄大使参与布鲁塞尔北约会议等表面姿态均不足以弥补北约向俄罗斯边境扩张、在东欧部署反弹道导弹，或者肢解塞尔维亚的实际行动。
The overthrow of Libya’s Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi and ongoing efforts to undercut the Kremlin’s client, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, have only made matters worse.	推翻利比亚上校卡扎菲和持续破坏克里姆林代言人叙利亚巴沙尔·阿萨德总统只能让情况进一步恶化。
If status was an important motive for Putin’s actions in Crimea, the West’s response may have a greater impact than many now believe.	如果地位问题是普京开展克里米亚行动的主要动机，那么西方应对之策的影响可能会比现在很多人认为的要大。
Before the Winter Games in Sochi (where the G-8 was scheduled to meet in June), Putin cited increased soft power as an important goal for Russia – an objective that his use of hard power in Ukraine has made much more difficult to achieve.	索契冬奥会前（八国集团原定于六月召开会议 ） ， 普京曾提出增强软实力是俄罗斯的重要目标 — — 他在乌克兰动用武力导致提高软实力的难度明显加大。
In this sense, Obama’s declaration that Russia is a regional power acting out of weakness, no less than Russia’s suspension from the G-8, may have hit Putin where he is most vulnerable.	从这个意义上讲，奥巴马宣布俄国是因为脆弱而采取行动的地区强国，正如将俄国开除出八国集团一样，可能恰恰命中了普京的薄弱之处。
His actions in Ukraine have undoubtedly brought Russia tangible gains in the short term.	普京在乌克兰的行动无疑为俄国带来了短期效益。
But they also imply less obvious costs. It remains to be seen whether Putin’s bold move was worth it.	但同时也付出了不那么明显的成本，普京的大胆举动是否值得还有待观察。
	
1914 Revisited?	1914重现？
CAMBRIDGE – This year marks the hundredth anniversary of a transformative event of modern history.	美国剑桥—今年是现代史上具有转折意义的事件的一百周年纪念。
World War I killed some 20 million people and ground up a generation of Europe’s youth. It also fundamentally changed the international order in Europe and beyond.	第一次世界大战夺走了大约2000万人的生命，摧毁了一整代欧洲青年，也根本性地改变了欧洲和世界的国际秩序。
Indeed, WWI destroyed not only lives, but also three empires in Europe – those of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Russia – and, with the collapse of Ottoman rule, a fourth on its fringe.	事实上，一战不但摧毁了无数生命，也摧毁了三个欧洲帝国 — — 日耳曼、奥匈和沙俄，奥斯曼土耳其帝国的崩溃可以算边缘的第四个。
Until the Great War, the global balance of power was centered in Europe; after it, the United States and Japan emerged as great powers.	在这场大战前，全球实力平衡的中心在欧洲；之后，美国和日本崛起成为新超级大国。
The war also ushered in the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, prepared the way for fascism, and intensified and broadened the ideological battles that wracked the twentieth century.	大战还带来了1917年布尔什维克革命，酝酿了法西斯，也加剧和扩大了困扰二十世纪的意识形态之争。
How could such a catastrophe happen?	如此灾难是如何发生的？
Shortly after the war broke out, when German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg was asked to explain what happened, he answered, “Oh, if I only knew!”	大战爆发没多久，德国总理贝特曼-赫尔维格（Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg）在解释发生了什么事时说 ： “ 哦，我要是知道就好了 ！ ”
Perhaps in the interest of self-exoneration, he came to regard the war as inevitable.	也许出于自我开脱的目的，他认为大战是不可避免的。
Similarly, the British Foreign Minister, Sir Edward Grey, argued that he had “come to think that no human individual could have prevented it.”	类似地，英国首相格雷爵士（Sir Edward Grey）指出他“认为没有人类能够事先阻止它的发生 。 ”
The question we face today is whether it could happen again.	今天，我们面对的问题是它会不会再次发生。
Margaret MacMillan, author of the interesting new book The War that Ended Peace, argues that, “it is tempting – and sobering – to compare today’s relationship between China and the US with that between Germany and Britain a century ago.”	在饶有兴味的新书《结束和平的战争 》 （ The War that Ended Peace）中，麦克米伦（Margaret MacMillan）指出 ， “ 将今天的中美关系和一个世纪前的德英关系作对比引人入胜、使人警醒 。 ”
After drawing a similar comparison, The Economist concludes that “the most troubling similarity between 1914 and now is complacency.”	在做了类似的比较后 ， 《 经济学人 》 （ The Economist）做出的结论是“1914年和现在最令人警惕的相似之处是自满 。 ”
And some political scientists, such as John Mearsheimer of the University of Chicago, have argued that, “to put it bluntly: China cannot rise peacefully.”	一些政治家，如芝加哥大学的梅尔西梅尔（John Mearsheimer）指出“坦率地说就是，中国不可能和平崛起 。 ”
But historical analogies, though sometimes useful for precautionary purposes, become dangerous when they convey a sense of historical inevitability.	但历史相似性尽管有益于预防，但若揭示出某种历史必然性也是危险的。
WWI was not inevitable.	一战不是不可避免的。
It was made more probable by Germany’s rising power and the fear that this created in Great Britain.	德国实力的增强以及由此造成的英国的担心让大战可能性增加了。
But it was also made more probable by Germany’s fearful response to Russia’s rising power, as well as myriad other factors, including human errors.	但同样增加了大战可能性的还有德国对沙俄实力增加的恐慌性反应以及包括人为失误在内的其他诸多因素。
But the gap in overall power between the US and China today is greater than that between Germany and Britain in 1914.	但今天美国和中国之间的实力总差距比1914年的德国和英国更大。
Drawing contemporary lessons from 1914 requires dispelling the many myths have been created about WWI.	从1914年汲取教训需要解构许多关于一战的神话。
For example, the claim that it was a deliberate preventive war by Germany is belied by the evidence showing that key elites did not believe this.	比如，说一战是德国故意引发的预防性战争是错误的，有证据证明德国精英并不这么认为。
Nor was WWI a purely accidental war, as others maintain: Austria went to war deliberately, to fend off the threat of rising Slavic nationalism.	说一战纯粹是意外战争也是错误的：奥地利有战争意图，为的是阻止塞尔维亚民族主义的日趋高涨。
There were miscalculations over the war’s length and depth, but that is not the same as an accidental war.	战争的长度和深度都被错误估计了，但这并不能证明这是意外战争。
It is also said that the war was caused by an uncontrolled arms race in Europe.	还有人说，一战是由失控的欧洲军备竞赛引起的。
But the naval arms race was over by 1912, and Britain had won.	但海军军备竞赛在1912年就以英国的胜利告终了。
While there was concern in Europe about the growing strength of armies, the view that the war was precipitated directly by the arms race is facile.	尽管当时在欧洲也存在关于军队力量日益增加的担忧，但认为战争是军备竞赛的直接产物仍是错误的。
Today’s world is different from the world of 1914 in several important ways.	当今世界与1914年存在诸多重要不同。
One is that nuclear weapons give political leaders the equivalent of a crystal ball that shows what their world would look like after escalation.	其中之一是核武器就相当于政治领袖手上的水晶球，透过它可以看到战争升级后的世界会是怎样一片焦土。
Perhaps if the Emperor, the Kaiser, and the Czar had had a crystal ball showing their empires destroyed and their thrones lost in 1918, they would have been more prudent in 1914.	也许如果皇帝、凯撒和沙皇也有水晶球，并且看到了1918年将是帝国末日，他们将失去皇位，那么他们在1914年就会更加谨慎。
Certainly, the crystal-ball effect had a strong influence on US and Soviet leaders during the Cuban missile crisis.	毫无疑问，水晶球效应在古巴导弹危机期间对美国和苏联领导人形成了重要影响。
It would likely have a similar influence on US and Chinese leaders today.	对今天的美国和中国领导人也是如此。
Another difference is that the ideology of war is much weaker nowadays.	另一个不同是如今的战争意识形态要弱得多。
In 1914, war really was thought to be inevitable, a fatalistic view reinforced by the Social Darwinist argument that war should be welcomed, because it would “clear the air” like a good summer storm.	1914年，战争确实被认为是不可避免的，这个致命观点因为社会达尔文主义信条而被强化了。 社会达尔文主义认为，战争是值得欢迎的，因为它就像夏季风暴一样能“让空气清新 ” 。
As Winston Churchill wrote in The World Crisis:	丘吉尔在《世界危机 》 （ The World Crisis）中写道：
“There was a strange temper in the air.	“空气中有股奇怪的味道。
Unsatisfied by material prosperity, the nations turned fiercely toward strife, internal or external.	各国对物质繁荣还不满足，热衷于内部和外部争吵。
National passions, unduly exalted in the decline of religion, burned beneath the surface of nearly every land with fierce, if shrouded, fires.	因宗教衰落而高涨的国民热情正在几乎每一篇土地下面猛烈地燃烧着，只不过火苗被掩盖了。
Almost one might think the world wished to suffer.	我们几乎可以确定，世界想吃点苦头。
Certainly men were everywhere eager to dare.”	显然各地的男人们都渴望冒险 。 ”
To be sure, nationalism is growing in China today, while the US launched two wars after the September 11, 2001, attacks.	诚然，如今中国的民族主义也在日益高涨，而美国在2001年9月11日后发动了两场战争。
But neither country is bellicose or complacent about a limited war.	但中美都不是好斗国家，也不会满足于有限战争。
China aspires to play a larger role in its region, and the US has regional allies to whose defense it is committed.	中国志在扩大地区影响，而美国在该地区拥有盟友并作出了防务承诺。
Miscalculations are always possible, but the risk can be minimized by the right policy choices.	误算的可能永远存在，但其风险可以通过正确的政策选择来最小化。
Indeed, on many issues – for example, energy, climate change, and financial stability – China and the US have strong incentives to cooperate.	事实上，在许多问题上 — — 比如能源、气候变化和金融稳定 — — 中国和美国都有很大的合作动机。
Moreover, whereas Germany in 1914 was pressing hard on Britain’s heels (and had surpassed it in terms of industrial strength), the US remains decades ahead of China in overall military, economic, and soft-power resources.	此外，1914年的德国给英国造成了极大压力（并在工业优势方面超越了英国 ） ， 而如今美国在总体军事、经济和软实力资源方面仍领先中国数十年。
Too adventuresome a policy would jeopardize China’s gains at home and abroad.	太冒险的政策将毁掉中国所取得的国内外进展。
In other words, the US has more time to manage its relations with a rising power than Britain did a century ago.	换句话说，今天的美国比一百年前的英国有更多的时间处理其与崛起新势力的关系。
Too much fear can be self-fulfilling.	太多恐慌将演变为自我实现。
Whether the US and China will manage their relationship well is another question.	美国和中国能否管理好它们的关系是另一个问题。
But how they do so will be dictated by human choice, not some ironclad historical law.	但这一问题将由人为选择决定，而不是由亘古不变的历史法则决定。
Among the lessons to be learned from the events of 1914 is to be wary of analysts wielding historical analogies, particularly if they have a whiff of inevitability.	在从1914年汲取教训的同时也要警惕历史相似论，特别是在这引起不可避免论时。
War is never inevitable, though the belief that it is can become one of its causes.	战争永远不是不可避免的，尽管认定其不可避免可能成为战争爆发的原因。
	
The Old World’s New Roles	旧世界的新角色
CAMBRIDGE – China’s rise has raised many questions for the West, with some wondering whether it is set to usurp a struggling Europe’s global leadership role.	美国剑桥—中国崛起给西方造成了很多问题，一些人担心中国是否意在夺取举步艰难的欧洲的全球领导角色。
As one columnist put it, “there is nothing much European governments can do in East Asia, save serve as marketing managers for their domestic businesses.”	某专栏作家指出 ， “ 欧洲政府在东亚没什么事可干，无非是为本国企业当好营销经理 。 ”
With neither the diplomatic weight nor the military heft to make an impression in the region, Europe had better leave the heavy lifting to the United States.	欧洲既没有外交分量，也没有军事实力可以在东亚留下痕迹，最好还是把重点放在美国身上。
But this does not have to be the case.	但事实并非如此。
For Europe, the implications of China’s rise are far-reaching, beginning with the United States’ strategic “pivot” toward Asia.	对欧洲来说，中国崛起的影响是深远的，其起始点是美国战略性“转向”亚洲。
After more than 70 years as a top US priority, Europe is beginning to lose its privileged position in the eyes of American policymakers.	欧洲身为美国最重要着眼点已有70多年，但在美国决策者眼中，它正在失去这一超然地位。
Moreover, European sales of high-tech dual-use products that complicate America’s security role in Asia is bound to create friction.	此外，欧洲销售与美国在亚洲的安全角色相冲突的高科技军民两用产品也必然会造成摩擦。
Nonetheless, warnings that the Atlantic partnership is eroding are unduly dire.	尽管如此，关于大西洋合作伙伴关系正在销蚀毫无疑问是言过其实的。
Tellingly, US President Barack Obama’s administration has replaced the term “pivot,” which implies a turn away from something, with “rebalancing.”	很能说明问题的是，美国总统奥巴马政府已经将隐含离开含义的“转向”一词替换为“再平衡 ” 。
This change reflects a recognition that China’s increasing economic dominance does not negate the importance of the European Union, which remains the world’s largest economic entity and a leading source of economic innovation, not to mention values like the protection of human rights.	这一变化反映出美国认为中国经济主宰力的增加并非欧盟重要性的对立面，欧盟仍是世界最大经济实体，也是经济创新的主要源泉，更不用说人权保护方面的价值了。
This is not to say that Asia’s rise will not demand adjustments.	这并不是说亚洲的崛起不需要调整。
When the Industrial Revolution began, Asia’s share of the global economy began to decline from more than 50% to just 20% by 1900.	当工业革命开始时，亚洲占全球经济比重也开始从50%以上下降至1900年的只占20 % 。
By the second half of this century, Asia is expected to recover its former economic dominance – that is, account for 50% of global output – while lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.	到本世纪下半叶，预计亚洲将恢复此前的经济���导地位，即占全球产出的50 % ， 同时让数亿人摆脱贫困。
This power shift – perhaps the most consequential of the twenty-first century – implies serious risks.	这一实力变迁 — — 也许是二十一世纪最重要的事件 — — 隐含着严重的风险。
Historians often warn that the fear and uncertainty generated by the emergence of new powers like China can trigger serious conflict, like that which Europe experienced a century ago, when Germany overtook the United Kingdom in industrial production.	历史学家经常警告，中国等新强国的出现所造成的恐慌和不确定性可能引发严重冲突，就像一个世纪前德国在工业生产上赶超英国时欧洲所经历的那样。
With Asia riven by territorial disputes and historical tensions, maintaining a stable security balance will not be easy.	面对饱受领土争端和历史恩怨纠缠的亚洲，保持稳定的安全平衡并非易事。
But there are levers in place that can help.	但我们也可以找到支点以供利用。
In the 1990s, when US President Bill Clinton’s administration was considering how to respond to China’s increasing economic might, some urged a policy of containment.	20世纪90年代，美国总统克林顿政府考虑如何应对不断增长的中国经济实力，有人敦促采取遏制政策。
Clinton rejected that advice: It would have been impossible to forge an anti-China alliance, given the enduring desire of China’s neighbors to maintain good relations with it; more important, such a policy would have guaranteed future enmity with China.	克林顿拒绝了这一建议：建立反中同盟是不可能的，因为中国的邻国向来有与中国搞好关系的强烈愿望；更重要的是，这一政策不啻于让中国彻底成为未来敌人。
Instead, Clinton chose a policy that could be called “integrate and insure.”	相反，克林顿选择了可以称之为“融合与确保 ” （ integrate and insure）的政策。
While China was welcomed into the World Trade Organization (WTO), America revived its security treaty with Japan.	中国被接纳为世贸组织成员国，而美国则修订了与日本的安保条约。
If China pursues a “peaceful rise,” its neighbors will focus on building strong economic relationships with it.	如果中国追求“和平崛起 ” ， 其邻国将专注于建立与中国的密切经济联系。
If it throws its weight around – which some say is implied by its recent actions on the Indian border and in the East and South China Seas – its neighbors will seek to balance its power, with an American naval presence offering backup.	如果它向周边耀武扬威 — — 有人认为其最近在中印边界和东海和南海的动作便属此类 — — 其邻国就会追求实力平衡，而美国海军的身影将为它们提供底气。
Where does Europe fit into this picture?	欧洲在这一局势中处于什么地位？
For starters, it should monitor and restrain sensitive exports to avoid making the security situation more dangerous for the US.	首先，它应该监控和克制敏感出口，以避免让安全局势变得对美国更加危险。
Even in trading terms, Europe has an interest in regional stability and secure sea lanes.	即使在贸易条件方面，地区稳定和安全的海路也有利于欧洲的利益。
Furthermore, Europe can contribute to the development of the norms that shape the security environment.	此外，欧洲能够帮助发展决定安全环境的范式。
For example, Europe can play an important role in reinforcing a universal interpretation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, rather than China’s idiosyncratic version – especially given that the US has not even ratified the treaty.	比如，欧洲可以在执行联合国海洋法公约（United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea）的普通解释而非中国提出的特殊解释方面起到重要作用 — — 特别是在美国尚未签署该条约的情况下。
Contrary to the claims of some analysts, China is not a revisionist state like Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union, eager to overthrow the established international order.	与一些分析家的观点相反，中国并非类似纳粹德国或苏联那样的修正主义国家，它并不急于推翻现有国际秩序。
Indeed, it is not in China’s interest to destroy international institutions – such as the United Nations, the WTO, and the International Monetary Fund – that have helped to facilitate its rise.	事实上，破坏在其崛起过程中起到促进作用的国际机构 — — 如联合国、世贸组织和国际货币基金组织 — — 不符合中国利益。
Given Europe’s leading roles in such institutions, it can help China gain the multilateral legitimacy that it seeks, in exchange for responsible behavior.	由于欧洲在这些机构中扮演着领导角色，因此它可以帮助中国获得其所追求的多边合法性，以换取中国的负责任的行为。
Though China is not attempting to upend the global order, it is now undergoing a profound – and destabilizing – transformation.	尽管中国并不试图颠覆全球秩序，但眼下它正在经历一场深远的 — — 也是破坏性的 — — 转型。
With the rise of transnational issues like climate change, terrorism, pandemics, and cyber crime – brought about by rapid technological progress and social change – power is being diffused not among states, but among a wide range of non-governmental entities.	在气候变化、恐怖主义、传染病和网络犯罪等跨国问题上 — — 快速的科技进步和社会变革是造成这些问题的原因 — — 实力并不是在国家间分布的，而是在非政府实体间分布的。
Addressing these challenges will require broad international cooperation, with China, the US, and Europe each playing an important role.	解决这些挑战要求广泛的国际合作，中国、美国和欧洲都可以扮演重要角色。
Finally, there is the question of values.	最后还有价值问题。
Europe, together with the US, has already resisted Chinese (and Russian) demands for greater Internet censorship.	欧洲，以及美国，拒绝了中国（和俄罗斯）加强互联网审查的要求。
And European countries like Norway and Germany have willingly taken economic hits in the name of human rights.	挪威和德国等欧洲国家也愿意以人权为名采取经济打击。
While it is impossible to predict how Chinese politics will evolve, other countries’ experiences suggest that political change often occurs when per capita income reaches roughly $10,000.	预测中国政治会如何演进是不可能的，但其他国家的经验表明政治变革通常发生在人均收入达到10,000美元左右水平的时候。
If such change does occur, Europe will have an opening to promote its core values even more effectively.	如果这一变革真的发生，欧洲将有机会更有效地推广其核心价值。
Whether China’s economic interest in an impartial world order based on the rule of law will lead to greater protection of individual rights remains to be seen.	中国在基于法治精神的公平世界秩序中的经济利益能否带来个人权利的更大保护还有待观察。
Only China will decide that.	只有中国能够决定着一点。
But Europe can make a strong case.	但欧洲可以起重要作用。
	
Duties Without Borders	不分国界的责任
CAMBRIDGE – More than 130,000 people are said to have died in Syria’s civil war.	美国剑桥—据说已有130,000多人在叙利亚内战中丧生。
United Nations reports of atrocities, Internet images of attacks on civilians, and accounts of suffering refugees rend our hearts.	联合国的暴行报告、互联网上关于袭击平民的图片以及流离失所的难民的口述让我们揪心。
But what is to be done – and by whom?	但我们可以做些什么呢？ 又由谁来做呢？
Recently, the Canadian scholar-politician Michael Ignatieff urged US President Barack Obama to impose a no-fly zone over Syria, despite the near-certainty that Russia would veto the United Nations Security Council resolution needed to legalize such a move.	最近，加拿大学者型政治家迈克尔·伊格纳提夫（Michael Ignatieff）敦促美国总统奥巴马在叙利亚设置禁飞区，但俄罗斯几乎肯定会否决这一措施合法化所必须的联合国安理会决议。
In Ignatieff’s view, if Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is allowed to prevail, his forces will obliterate the remaining Sunni insurgents – at least for now; with hatreds inflamed, blood eventually will flow again.	伊格纳提夫认为，如果放任叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德继续统治，他的部队将击溃省下的逊尼派起义军 — — 至少现在是如此，而仇恨会蔓延，流血终将再次发生。
In an adjoining article, the columnist Thomas Friedman drew some lessons from the United States’ recent experience in the Middle East.	在一篇类似的文章中，专栏作家托马斯·弗里德曼（Thomas Friedman）从了美国最近在中东的经验中总结了几个要点。
First, Americans understand little about the social and political complexities of the countries there.	首先，美国人对中东国家的社会和政治复杂性所知甚少。
Second, the US can stop bad things from happening (at considerable cost), but it cannot make good things happen by itself.	其次，美国可以停止坏事的发生（要付出很大的代价 ） ， 但好事是不会自己发生的。
And, third, when America tries to make good things happen in these countries, it runs the risk of assuming responsibility for solving their problems.	第三，当美国试图让这些国家发生好事时，就要承担解决这些国家问题的责任的风险。
So what are a leader’s duties beyond borders?	因此，领导人超越国界的责任在哪里？
The problem extends far beyond Syria – witness recent killings in South Sudan, the Central African Republic, Somalia, and other places.	这一问题的意义远不止于叙利亚 — — 放眼全球，南苏丹、中非共和国、索马里和其他很多地方都在发生杀戮。
In 2005, the UN General Assembly unanimously recognized a “responsibility to protect” citizens when their own government fails to do so, and in 2011 it was invoked in UN Security Council Resolution 1973, authorizing the use of military force in Libya.	2005年，联合国大会一致通过了在政府无作为时对人民的“保护责任 ” ， 2011年这一责任被联合国安理会1973号决议援引，授权对利比亚动武。
Russia, China, and others believe that the principle was misused in Libya, and that the guiding doctrine of international law remains the UN Charter, which prohibits the use of force except in self-defense, or when authorized by the Security Council.	俄罗斯、中国和其他国家认为这一原则在利比亚滥用了，国家法的指导思想仍应是联合国宪章，而宪章禁止在除自卫或得到安理会授权之外的情形中使用武力。
But, back in 1999, when faced with a Russian veto of a potential Security Council resolution in the case of Kosovo, NATO used force anyway, and many defenders argued that, legality aside, the decision was morally justified.	但是，1999年，尽管俄罗斯否决了科索沃问题的潜在安理会决议，但北约仍然使用了武力，许多人为此辩护说，抛开法律问题不谈，这一决定是合乎道德的。
So which arguments should political leaders follow when trying to decide the right policy to pursue?	那么，在决定什么政策值得追求时，政治领袖应该考虑哪些因素？
The answer depends, in part, on the collectivity to which he or she feels morally obliged.	答案部分取决于他认为在道德上负有义务的集体。
Above the small-group level, human identity is shaped by what Benedict Anderson calls “imagined communities.”	在小团体水平之上，人的身份由本尼迪克特·安德森（Benedict Anderson）所谓的“想象的共同体”决定。
Few people have direct experience of the other members of the community with which they identify.	很少有人拥有其所认同的社会的其他成员所拥有的直接经验。
In recent centuries, the nation has been the imagined community for which most people were willing to make sacrifices, and even to die, and most leaders have seen their primary obligations to be national in scope.	在近几个世纪中，国家便是大部分人甘愿作出牺牲甚至献身的想象的共同体，大部分领导人的首要义务是代表国家利益。
In a world of globalization, however, many people belong to multiple imagined communities.	但是，在一个组织的世界中，许多人同时属于很多想象的共同体。
Some – local, regional, national, cosmopolitan – seem to be arranged as concentric circles, with the strength of identity diminishing with distance from the core; but, in a global information age, this ordering has become confused.	其中一些 — — 地方的、地区的、国家的、世界的 — — 被认为是核心圈，身份的强度随其与核心的距离的增长而缩小；但是，在全球信息时代，这一秩序变得不那么清晰了。
Today, many identities are overlapping circles – affinities sustained by the Internet and cheap travel.	徐进，众多身份属于互相重叠的圈子 — — 以互联网和廉价旅行维系的亲密关系。
Diasporas are now a mouse click away.	天涯若比邻耳。
Professional groups adhere to transnational standards.	专业团体往往基于跨国标准。
Activist groups, ranging from environmentalists to terrorists, also connect across borders.	活动团体 — — 从环保分子到恐怖分子 — — 也进行着跨境联系。
As a result, sovereignty is no longer as absolute and impenetrable as it once seemed.	因此，主权已不再像从前那样绝对和不可逾越。
This is the reality that the UN General Assembly acknowledged when it recognized a responsibility to protect endangered people in sovereign states.	联合国大会在承认其保护主权国家危险之中的人民的责任时也承认了这一现实。
But what moral obligation does this place on a particular leader like Obama?	但对于像奥巴马这样的特殊领袖，道德义务在此处有何作用？
The leadership theorist Barbara Kellerman has accused former US President Bill Clinton of the moral failure of insularity for his inadequate response to the genocide in Rwanda in 1994.	领导力理论家芭芭拉·克莱曼（Barbara Kellerman）指责美国前总统克林顿在对1994年卢旺达种族屠杀事件应对不力中存在偏隘的道德失职。
In one sense, she is right.	从某种程度上说，她是正确的。
But other leaders were also insular, and no country responded adequately.	但其他领导人也偏隘了，没有一个国家采取了有力的应对措施。
Had Clinton tried to send American troops, he would have encountered stiff resistance in the US Congress.	如果克林顿尝试派兵，他将在美国国会遇到重大阻力。
Coming so soon after the death of US soldiers in the 1993 humanitarian intervention in Somalia, the American public was in no mood for another military mission abroad.	当时，年美国士兵刚刚在在索马里人道干预中伤亡惨重，美国公众没有想法再进行海外军事任务。
So what should a democratically elected leader do in such circumstances?	那么，民选领导人在这样的环境下应该如何做？
Clinton has acknowledged that he could have done more to galvanize the UN and other countries to save lives in Rwanda.	克林顿承认他本可以更大力度地敦促联合国和其他国家拯救卢旺达人的生命。
But good leaders today are often caught between their personal cosmopolitan inclinations and their more traditional obligations to the citizens who elected them.	但今天的优秀领导人往往会在个人的世界主义倾向和对选举他们的人民的更加传统的义务之间难以抉择。
Fortunately, insularity is not an “all or nothing” moral proposition.	幸运的是，偏隘并不是一种“非此即彼”的道德命题。
In a world in which people are organized in national communities, a purely cosmopolitan ideal is unrealistic.	在一个人民根据国家社区组织的世界中，纯粹的世界主义理想是不现实的。
Global income equalization, for example, is not a credible obligation for a national political leader; but such a leader could rally followers by saying that more should be done to reduce poverty and disease worldwide.	比如，全球收入平等对国家政治领袖来说就不是一个可信的义务，但同样是这位领袖，他可以声称应该做更多事减少全世界的贫困和疾病，以此招徕追随者。
As the philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah has put it, “Thou shalt not kill is a test you take pass-fail. Honor thy father and thy mother admits of gradations.”	哲学家科瓦姆·安东尼·阿皮亚（Kwame Anthony Appiah）指出 ： “ ‘汝不可杀人’是及格测试 ， ‘ 尊重你的父母’是承认等级 。 ”
The same is true of cosmopolitanism versus insularity.	世界主义和偏隘之间也是如此。
We may admire leaders who make efforts to increase their followers’ sense of moral duties beyond borders; but it does little good to hold leaders to an impossible standard that would undercut their capacity to remain leaders.	我们敬仰试图增加追随者超越国界的道德责任感的领袖；但以会影响到领袖地位的难以企及的标准要求领袖也是于事无补的。
As Obama wrestles with determining his responsibilities in Syria and elsewhere, he faces a serious moral dilemma.	在竭力权衡其在叙利亚和其他地方的责任时，奥巴马面临着严重的道德困境。
As Appiah says, duties beyond borders are a matter of degree; and there are also degrees of intervention that range from aid to refugees and arms to different degrees of the use of force.	正如阿皮亚所说，跨国责任是程度问题；干预也有程度，从援助难民、武器援助到不同程度的使用武力。
But even when making these graduated choices, a leader also owes his followers a duty of prudence – of remembering the Hippocratic oath to first of all, do no harm.	但即使是在做出这些成熟的选择时，领袖也对其追随者负有审慎责任 — — 时刻铭记“首先不要伤害”的希波克拉底誓言。
Ignatieff says Obama already owns the consequences of his inaction; Friedman reminds him of the virtue of prudence.	伊格纳提夫说，奥巴马已经领教了不作为的后果；而弗里德曼则提醒他审慎的美德。
Pity Obama.	可怜的奥巴马。
	
Safeguarding Cyberspace	捍卫网络空间
CAMBRIDGE – Brazil recently hosted NETmundial, the first global conference on Internet governance, attended by 800 representatives of governments, corporations, civil-society organizations, and technologists.	坎布里齐 — — 巴西最近举办了互联网管理领域首届全球会议NETmundial，有800名政府、企业、民间社会组织和技术界代表与会。
Based on the notion of “multi-stakeholderism,” the meeting produced a 12-page “outcomes” document.	在“多利益相关者”的理念基础上，此次会议拿出了一份12页的“成果”文件。
Nonetheless, at the end of the conference, there was still no consensus on global cyber governance.	然而会议结束时，仍然没有就全球网络治理问题达成共识。
Many governments continued to advocate traditional United Nations voting procedures for making global decisions, and defend their right to control domestic cyber activities.	许多政府主张继续沿用联合国表决的传统程序进行全局决策，捍卫政府控制国内网络活动的权利。
In a sense, this is not surprising.	从某种意义上讲，这并不值得大惊小怪。
After all, though the Internet is a complex, fast-evolving, and all-encompassing global resource, it has not been around for very long.	毕竟，虽然互联网是种复杂、发展迅速且包罗万象的全球资源，但它的历史还不是很长。
While the World Wide Web was conceived in 1989, it was only in the last 15 years that the number of Web sites burgeoned, and Internet technology began to transform global supply chains.	虽然万维网的构想起源于1989年，网站数量突飞猛进、互联网科技开始改变全球供应链还仅仅是近15年的事。
Since 1992, the number of Internet users has exploded from one million to nearly three billion. Just like that, the Internet became a substrate of economic, social, and political life.	从1992年起，网民数量从一百万激增到近30亿，互联网成为经济、社会和政治生活的基石。
In its early days, the Internet was often characterized as the ultimate egalitarian conduit of free-flowing information – a harbinger of the end of government controls.	成立初期的互联网往往被定义为信息自由流动的终极平等主义管道 — — 亦即结束政府控制的先驱。
But the reality is that governments and geographical jurisdictions have always played a central role in regulating the Internet – or at least have tried.	但现实状况却是政府和地域管辖机构一直在互联网监管中发挥着核心作用 — — 至少他们力求如此。
Ultimately, however, the Internet poses a major governance challenge, exemplified in ongoing efforts to understand the implications of ubiquitous mobility and the collection and storage of “big data.”	但归根结底，互联网构成了重大的治理挑战，这既体现在努力理解流动性无所不在的影响，也体现在“大数据”的存储和搜集。
The governance challenge stems from the fact that cyberspace is a combination of virtual properties, which defy geographical boundaries, and physical infrastructure, which fall under sovereign jurisdictions.	治理挑战源于网络空间是虚拟资产的组合，它既不存在地域界限，也不属于物理基础设施，因此不归属主权司法辖区管理。
Control of the physical layer can have both territorial and extraterritorial effects on the virtual layers.	物理层的控制可以对虚拟层产生域内和域外效力。
At the same time, attacks can be launched from the low-cost virtual realm against the physical domain, where resources are scarce and expensive.	同时可以从低成本的虚拟领域对资源稀缺而昂贵的实体领域发动攻击。
The Internet began as a small village of known users, where an authentication layer of code was unnecessary and the development of norms was simple.	互联网用户开始时都相互认识，因此无需进行代码验证，制定规则也并非难事。
But then it grew, and everything changed.	但随着互联网发展壮大一切不再像起初那样容易。
Though cyberspace offered the advantages of access to information and easy communication to a growing number of people, it became a breeding ground for crime, hacker attacks, and threats to governments.	虽然网络空间让越来越多人掌握了信息获取及沟通便捷的优势，但它也逐渐成为滋生犯罪、黑客攻击的温床，并威胁到政府的利益。
Efforts to limit the risks incurred in this volatile environment have focused on creating private networks and “walled gardens” (closed platforms) – cyber equivalents to the seventeenth-century enclosures that were used to solve that era’s “tragedy of the commons.”	人们一般通���创建私有网络和“围墙花园 ” （ 即封闭平台）来控制环境动荡所带来的风险 — — 这与17世纪解决“平民悲剧”的圈地运动何其相似。
But this raises the risk of fragmentation, which, if allowed to go far enough, could curtail the Internet’s economic benefits.	但这样做增加了“隔离”的风险，如果任由这种趋势发展下去，可能会影响互联网的经济效益。
Given that security is a traditional function of the state, some observers believe that growing insecurity will lead to a greater role for governments in cyberspace.	鉴于安全是政府的一项传统职能，一些观察家认为越来越多的不安全因素会导致各国政府在网络空间中更为活跃。
Indeed, accounts of cyber war may be exaggerated, but cyber espionage is rampant, and more than 30 governments are reputed to have developed offensive capabilities and doctrines for the use of cyber weapons.	事实上，宣扬网络战争可能有些夸大其辞，但网络间谍活动的确非常猖獗，30多个国家政府被认为具备了网络武器应用的学说和攻击力。
Ever since the Stuxnet virus was used to disrupt Iran’s nuclear program in 2009-2010, governments have taken the threat posed by cyber weapons very seriously.	自从2009-2010年震网病毒被用于破坏伊朗核计划后，各国政府开始认真对待网络武器所造成威胁。
Governments also want to protect their societies from what comes through the Internet.	政府还希望保护本国社会不受互联网内容的损害。
For example, China’s government has not only created a “Great Firewall” of software filters; it also requires that companies take responsibility for censoring their public content.	比方说中国政府不仅建成了用于软件过滤的“长城防火墙 ” ； 还要求企业承担起审查公共内容的职责。
And, if China is attacked, it has the capacity to reduce its Internet connections.	而且在受到攻击的情况下，中国有能力减少其互联网连接。
But China’s government – and others that practice Internet censorship – still want to reap the economic benefits of connectivity.	但中国政府和其他实施互联网审查的机构却不愿放弃联网带来的经济效益。
That tension leads to imperfect compromises.	这样的紧张状况最终导致了不完美的妥协。
A similar tension exists in the effort to create international Internet-governance norms.	在创建国际互联网治理规范领域也存在相似的紧张态势。
While authoritarian countries like China and Russia seek “information security,” including the kind of overt censorship that would be prohibited in countries like the United States, Western democracies pursue “cyber security.”	中国和俄罗斯等专制国家寻求的所谓“信息安全”也包括美国和西方民主国家追求“网络安全”的公开审查制。
This divergence was starkly apparent in 2012, at a conference convened in Dubai by the UN’s International Telecommunications Union (ITU).	联合国国际电信联盟（ITU）在迪拜召开的会议毫不掩饰地体现了这种分歧。
Though the meeting was ostensibly about updating telephony regulations, the underlying issue was the ITU’s role in Internet governance.	虽然会议的表面议题是更新电话章程，但国际电信联盟在互联网治理中的作用才是根本性问题。
Authoritarian regimes and many developing countries believe that their approach to sovereignty, security, and development would benefit from the multilateral processes that the ITU employs.	独裁政权和许多发展中国家认为其主权、安全和发展策略将受益于国际电信联盟采用的多边程序。
But democratic governments fear that these processes are too cumbersome, and would undercut the flexibility of the “multi-stakeholder” approach, which stresses the involvement of the private and non-profit sectors, as well as governments.	但民主政府却担心上述程序过于繁琐，并且会影响到强调政府和私有及非营利部门参与并重的“多方利益攸关者”策略的灵活性。
The vote in Dubai was 89 to 55 against the “democratic” governments.	迪拜投票的结果是“民主政府”以55对89票落败。
This outcome raised concerns about a crisis in Internet governance – concerns that the recent conference in Brazil alleviated, but only slightly.	投票结果凸显了对互联网治理危机的担忧 — — 这种担忧在最近的巴西会议上有所缓解，但却远没有消失。
Stayed tuned.	请您一定继续关注。
There are many more conferences scheduled on cyber governance – and a lot more work to be done.	今后还将召开很多互联网治理方面的会议 — — 要做的工作还有很多。
	
Obama the Pragmatist	务实者奥巴马
CAMBRIDGE – Last month, in his address to the graduating cadets at the US Military Academy at West Point, President Barack Obama stated that some of America’s most costly mistakes since World War II were the result not of restraint, but of a “willingness to rush into military adventures without thinking through the consequences.”	美国剑桥—上个月，在为西点军校的毕业军官所做的演讲中，美国总统奥巴马提到美国在二战后所犯的一些代价高昂的错误不是因为克制，而是因为“总是在未经仔细考量后果前就匆忙采取军事行动 。 ”
Though Obama may be right, the speech did little to mollify critics who have accused him of passivity and weakness, particularly regarding Syria and Ukraine.	奥巴马也许是对的，但这次演讲并不能使批评他消极而孱弱的人（尤其是在叙利亚和乌克兰问题上）有所收敛。
This frustration can be blamed partly on the impossibly high expectations that Obama set in his early speeches, in which he inspired voters with promises of systemic transformation.	这一尴尬情形的部分原因在于奥巴马在其先前的演讲中建立了太高的期望 — — 他对选民承诺会带来系统性变革。
Unlike most candidates, Obama maintained this transformational rhetoric even after it secured him his victory in the 2008 campaign.	与大部分候选人不同，奥巴马在确保了2008年大选再胜后并未改变“变革”的口号。
Indeed, a series of addresses in the first year of his presidency raised expectations even higher, by establishing the goal of a nuclear-weapons-free world, promising to revamp America’s approach to the Middle East, and pledging to “bend history in the direction of justice.”	事实上，他在就任总统的第一年所做的一系列演讲提出了无核武器世界的目标，承诺改变美国的中东方针，还承诺“掰正历史的方向，朝正义前进 ” ， 这些内容进一步提高了人们对他的期望。
It is often said that democratic politicians campaign in poetry and govern in prose.	人们常说，民主政客在竞选时是诗人，治国时只会写流水账。
But there is no reason to believe that Obama was being disingenuous about his objectives.	但没有理由认为奥巴马因为他的目标而与众不同。
His vision simply could not withstand the recalcitrant and difficult world that confronted him; so he had to adjust.	他的愿景根本不能对抗他所面临的顽抗者和艰难时世；因此他必须做出调整。
After just one year in office, the man who had promised transformational leadership became a “transactional” leader – pragmatic to a fault.	在成为总统一年后，这位承诺要成为变革型领袖的人倒成了“事务型”领袖 — — 务实有余而变革不足。
And, despite what his critics say, this was a positive development.	而不管批评者怎么说，这是一个积极的变化。
While vowing to use force when America’s vital interests are at stake and rejecting pessimistic projections of national decline, Obama has – unlike his predecessor, George W. Bush – relied more heavily on diplomacy than force.	尽管奥巴马誓言会在事关美国关键利益时使用武力，并且拒绝接受美国衰落的消极预测，但他与前任小布什不同，他更多��依赖外交而不是武力。
For this, his critics have accused him of failing to promote American values and retreating into isolationism.	在这方面，他的批评者指责他没有推广美国价值，并且在向孤立主义退缩。
But restraint is not isolationism.	但克制不是孤立主义。
No one accused President Dwight Eisenhower of isolationism when he accepted a stalemate in the Korean War, refused to intervene at Dien Bien Phu, resisted recommendations from senior military officers regarding islands near Taiwan, watched the Red Army invade Hungary, or refused to back allies in the Suez Canal crisis.	没人会因为艾森豪威尔接受了朝鲜战争的僵局、拒绝干预奠边府、对高级军官关于台湾周边岛屿的献策视而不见、坐视红军侵入匈牙利或在苏伊士危机中拒绝支持盟友而被指责为孤立主义。
Nor did those who now disparage Obama’s measured response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s recent annexation of Ukrainian territory call Bush an isolationist for his weak response to Putin’s invasion of Georgia in 2008.	今天诋毁奥巴马对俄罗斯普京最近吞并乌克兰林土的行为采取谨慎反应的人也不会因为布什在2008年对普京入侵格鲁吉亚反应不够强硬而称其为孤立主义者。
In fact, Obama’s response to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine reflects his long-term vision.	事实上，奥巴马对俄罗斯入侵乌克兰行为的反应体现了他的长期愿景。
Though Putin has gained possession of Crimea, he has lost access to some of the resources that he needs to achieve his goal of restoring Russia’s former glory as a great power – and has reinvigorated NATO in the process.	尽管普京拥有了克里米亚，但也不再能够获得实现其重塑俄罗斯昔日超级大国荣光所必须的某些资源，也让北约重新获得了动力。
Effective foreign policymaking requires an understanding of not only international and transnational systems, but also the intricacies of domestic politics in multiple countries. It also demands recognition of just how little is known about “building nations,” particularly after revolutions – a process that should be viewed in terms of decades, not years.	有效的外交决策不但需要理解国际和跨国体系，也需要厘清各个国家的国内政治，还要求认识到关于“建国”我们是多么无知，特别是在革命之后（革命是一个应该用几十年而不是几年的视界去看待的过程 ） 。
In 1789, few observers in Paris would have predicted that a Corsican would lead French forces to the banks of the Nile within ten years.	1789年，几乎所有巴黎观察者都没有料到一个科西嘉人会在十年内率领法军挺近尼罗河沿岸。
And foreign intervention in the French Revolution only fanned nationalist flames.	对法国大革命的外国干预的唯一效果是煽动了民族主义之火。
In such a complex and uncertain context, prudence is critical, and bold action based on a grandiose vision can be extremely dangerous.	在如此复杂和不确定的环境下，审慎至关重要，基于眼高于手的鲁莽行动是极度危险的。
This is what advocates of a more muscular approach to today’s revolutions in the Middle East often forget.	要求对今天的中东革命采取更强硬方针的人常常忘记这一点。
Of course, it makes sense for US leaders to nudge events at the margins in an effort to advance democratic values in the long term.	当然，美国领导人在外围推进事件发展，从而在长期推广民主价值是有意义的。
But attempting to direct revolutions that they do not fully understand would be a mistake, with potentially serious negative consequences for all parties involved.	但试图左右尚不能完全理解的革命的方向是一个错误，可能会对相关各方都造成严重的消极后果。
In fact, in the twentieth century, US presidents who pursued transformational foreign policies were neither more effective nor more ethical.	事实上，在二十世纪，追求变革型外交政策的美国总统收效并不大，也并不显得更道德。
Woodrow Wilson’s bet on the Versailles Treaty of 1919 contributed to the disastrous isolationism of the 1930’s.	威尔逊对1919年凡尔赛条约的赌注导致了20世纪30年代损失惨重的孤立主义。
And the bets that John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson made in Vietnam had devastating consequences, some of which are still being felt today.	而肯尼迪和约翰逊对越南的赌注带来了灾难性后果，贻害至今。
More recently, George W. Bush – who famously declared that he did not play “small ball” – attempted to transform the Middle East with his “freedom agenda.”	更近一些有小布什，他有一句名言，说自己不会玩“小手段 ” （ small ball ） ， 并试图根据他的“自由日程”改变中东。
More than a decade later, the US is still struggling to withdraw from the conflicts that he initiated.	十多年后，美国却在挣扎着从他发起的冲突中抽身。
Obama’s foreign-policy mistakes, by contrast, have had only modest repercussions.	相反，奥巴马的外交政策错误，只是略有影响。
To use Obama’s own baseball metaphor, aiming for achievable singles and doubles is often a more effective strategy than swinging wildly in an effort to hit a home run, only to strike out.	用奥巴马本人的棒球比喻来说，追求可以实现的上一垒和二垒安打常常比在实现本垒打和被震出局之间大幅波动更有效。
Of course, a game-winning home run is exciting.	当然，打出杀死比赛的本垒打是令人振奋的。
But a foreign-policy “victory” is not quite as straightforward – and the stakes are far higher.	但外交政策“胜利”并不像棒球比赛那样简单 — — 代价要高昂得多。
President George H. W. Bush understood this.	老布什就知道这一点。
A transactional leader, he famously stated that he did not do “the vision thing.”	作为事务性领导人，他提出了著名的不做“愿景这件事”的原则。
But, like Eisenhower, he steered the US through multiple crises, overseeing one of the more successful periods of US foreign policy in the last half-century.	但与艾森豪威尔一样，他领导美国度过了许多危机，他在任期间是美国在过去五十年中外交政策最成功的时期。
Of course, some of the criticism of Obama’s speech was valid.	当然，对奥巴马的批评中不乏有理有据者。
But much of it was just partisan politics.	但大部分只不过是党派政治。
To be constructive, the debate about Obama’s foreign policy must account for twentieth-century US history.	关于奥巴马的外交政策的建设性争论必须放在二十世纪美国史的背景下考虑。
In foreign policy, as in medicine, leaders must “first do no harm.”	外交政策就像一台机器，领导人必须“首先不要造成伤害 ” 。
Obama understands that.	奥巴马明白这一点。
One hopes that the relentless uninformed criticism that his pragmatic policies have elicited does not drive his successor to revert to a risky transformational approach.	我们希望其务实政策所导致的冷酷的一边倒的批评不会让其继任者回归危险的变革型方针。
	
Governance in the Information Age	信息时代的治理
ABU DHABI – As the year comes to an end, it is only natural to ask what might lie ahead.	阿布扎比—随着岁末的来临，一个很自然的问题是明年会怎样。
But, instead of asking what may lie ahead in 2014, let us jump to mid-century.	但是，现在我们不问2014年会怎样，而是跳到世纪中叶。
What will governance look like in 2050?	2050年的治理会怎样？
That is what the World Economic Forum (WEF) asked at a recent meeting in Abu Dhabi that focused on the future of governance under three potential scenarios arising from the ongoing information revolution.	这就是最近的世界经济论坛（WEF）阿布扎比会议所提出的问题。 这次会议集中讨论了信息革命所带来的三种潜在情景中的未来治理。
With that revolution already marginalizing some countries and communities – and creating new opportunities for others – the question could hardly be more timely.	这场革命已经让一些国家和社区边缘化了 — — 也为其他国家和社区创造了新机会 — — 因此提出这一问题可以说正逢其时。
The first scenario that participants considered is a world ruled by so-called “megacities,” where governance is administered largely by major urban agglomerations.	第一种情景是，参与者考虑一个有所谓“特大城市”主宰的世界，治理主要由大型都市圈来管理。
The second possibility is a world in which strong central governments use big data to fortify their control.	第二种可能是强大的中央政府使用大数据来加强控制。
And, in the third scenario, central governments are fundamentally weak, with markets – and the enterprises that dominate them – providing almost all services.	而在第三种情景中，中央政府从根本上十分脆弱，市场 — — 以及主宰市场的企业 — — 提供几乎所有服务。
Each of these scenarios is an extrapolation of a current trend.	这些情景都是当前趋势的外推。
While all of them could be beneficial in some respects, they also have features that, if left unchecked, could lead to dystopian outcomes.	从不同角度看，这三种情景都有有利的一面，但如果不仔细检视，也都可能导致反乌托邦结果。
Policymakers should already be implementing policies aimed at guiding trends like urbanization, the rise of big data, and the grouping of people into narrow communities, often based on their relationship to the market.	决策者应该已在实施旨在指导城镇化、大数据崛起和将人群编入（通常基于关系和市场的）小社区的政策。
The goal should be to take advantage of these trends’ potential benefits, while ensuring that they do not undermine other critical aspects of governance.	目标应该是利用这些趋势的潜在好处，同时确保它们不会破坏治理的其他关键方面。
For example, although megacities have the potential to create new opportunities for workers and businesses, they cannot solve universal problems like climate change or manage the production and protection of national and global public goods.	比如，尽管大都市有望为工人和企业创造新机会，但它们无法解决气候变化等全球性问题，也无法管理国家和全球层面公共品的生产和保护。
Likewise, while the use of big data has substantial problem-solving potential, important questions remain about who owns, who controls, and who regulates the use of the data.	类似地，尽管大数据具有巨大的解决问题的潜力，但仍存在重要问题：谁拥有、控制和监管大数据的运用？
The notion of a “datocracy” incites fear of an Orwellian “e-1984.”	“数据民主”的概念带来了奥威尔式的“电子1984”恐慌。
Indeed, the recent revelations about National Security Agency surveillance programs barely scratch the surface of the issue.	事实上，最新披露的国家安全局监控计划最多只能算冰山一角。
After all, the use of big data is not confined to governments and corporations; anonymous criminal groups can easily abuse the information, too.	毕竟，大数据的运用不受政府和公司的约束；匿名犯罪团伙也可以轻易地滥用信息。
Finally, while individual choice within markets is often the most efficient way to allocate resources, markets do not produce a sufficient supply of public goods.	最后，尽管市场中的个人选择通常是资源配置最高效的方式，但市场无法提供充足的公共品。
Indeed, there are some goods that the private sector is simply unable to provide.	事实上，有一些商品私人部门根本无法提供。
This system may seem acceptable to those within the “gated communities” that benefit from it, but what about all those left outside?	这套体系对于处于从中获利的“封闭社区”者来说可以接受，但“封闭社区”之外的人怎么办？
The WEF’s Global Agenda Council on the Future of Government, of which I am a part, has considered ways in which information technology can improve governance and reduce feelings of alienation among the governed.	WEF的未来政府全球日程委员会（Global Agenda Council on the Future of Government，我也参与其中）考虑了信息技术改善治理、减弱被治理者的疏离感的方法。
The most effective initiatives, the council observed, often arise from partnerships between government and the private sector.	委员会观察到，最有效的方案通常来自政府和私人部门的合作。
For example, in Kenya, a private company developed a mobile-payments system that allows users to transfer money using cell phones, effectively creating a banking system much more quickly than the government could have done.	比如，在肯尼亚，一家私人公司开发了一套移动支付系统，该系统允许用户使用手机转账，事实上创造了远比政府所能提供的更快捷的银行系统。
Once the system was privately created, the government was able to use it to provide additional services.	一旦这一系统被私人部门创造出来，政府也可以使用它来提供更���的服务。
As a result, a Kenyan farmer in a remote district can now obtain information about crop prices or transfer funds, without having to travel long distances and wait in lines.	于是，如今肯尼亚偏远地区的农民能够获得关于作物价格或转移支付资金的信息而不必长途跋涉和排长队。
While such initiatives cannot solve the problem of inequality, they can help to relieve some of its most damaging effects.	尽管这类方案无法解决不平等性问题，但它们有助于减轻不平等性问题最严重的后果。
At a time of rapid social change and relentless technological advancement, efforts to improve governance – at the local, national, or international level – will require careful thought and experimentation, in order to determine how to balance inclusive decision-making with the ever-evolving needs of markets.	现时代，社会变化日新月异，技术进步层出不穷，改善治理的努力 — — 不管在地方、国家还是国际层面 — — 需要谨慎的思考和实验，以确定如何平衡包容性决策和不断演化的市场需求。
As the American diplomat Harlan Cleveland once asked, “How will we get everybody in on the act, and still get some action?”	美国外交家克利夫兰（Harlan Cleveland）曾提出一个问题 ： “ 我们如何让所有人都动起来，然后仍能产生行动 ？ ”
Consider international institutions.	考虑国际机构。
Today, the world is organized into some 200 countries; in all likelihood, it will be in 2050 as well.	如今，整个世界被分为200多个国家；无论如何，2050年也将是如此。
But only 16 governmental entities account for two-thirds of the world’s income and two-thirds of its population.	但16个政府实体就占据了世界收入的三分之二和人口的三分之二。
Many have advocated the use of “double majorities” – which require a majority of votes according to two separate criteria, population and economic output – to elicit action from a manageable number of states while enhancing weaker states’ influence in decision-making.	许多人助长应该采取“双重多数 ” — —根据人口和经济产出这两个独立的标准衡量的多数票 — — 从可管理数量的国家中产生行动，同时增强弱国对决策的影响力。
But, though the G-20 has moved in this direction, the approach to setting a global agenda remains flawed.	但是，尽管G-20正在朝这一方向努力，其设置全球日程的方式仍是有缺陷的。
Indeed, it seems to be most effective in times of crisis; in more normal times, as we have seen, the G-20 struggles to get things done.	事实上，这一方式在危机时期最有效；但在正常时期我们看到，G-20难以很难产生什么成果。
Moreover, even if the double-majority system helps to empower some weaker states, it does not account for the role of the world’s smallest countries in global decision-making processes.	此外，即使双重多数制度有助于增强弱国权力，它也并未考虑世界最小国家在全球决策程序中的角色。
Although these countries represent a small share of the global population, they comprise a significant majority of the total number of countries.	尽管这些国家只占据了世界人口的极小部分，但它们组成了国家数量的极大部分。
One potential solution would be for states to represent each other, as occurs in the International Monetary Fund.	一个潜在解决方案时让国家代表彼此，就像在国际货币基金组织（IMF）中那样。
But the IMF’s experience exposes significant challenges in implementation.	但IMF的经验暴露出实施方面的巨大挑战。
World leaders have not yet figured out how to reconcile the moral conviction that all people are equal with the simple fact that all countries are not.	世界领袖还没有指出，如何让人人平等的道德结论与所有国家并不平等这一简单事实协调起来。
In a global information age, governance systems capable of addressing fundamental issues like security, welfare, liberty, and identity will require coalitions that are small enough to function efficiently and a decision concerning what to do about those who are underrepresented.	在全球信息时代，能解决安全、福利、自由和身份等根本问题的治理制度需要足够小因此能有效运转的联盟以及关注可以为未得到代表的群体做些什么的决定。
Obviously, all of this calls for a lot more investigation.	显然，所有这些都要求更多的研究。
Exploring potential future scenarios, as the WEF has done, is an important step in the right direction.	如WEF那样探索潜在未来情景是这一方向的重要一步。
	
Japan’s Self-Defense Defense	日本的自卫防御
CAMBRIDGE – Since the end of World War II, Japan has been ruled by an American-written “peace constitution,” Article 9 of which prohibits war and limits Japanese forces to self-defense.	美国剑桥—二战结束以来，日本一直由美国起草的“和平宪法”治理，其中的第九条禁止日本参与战争，也限制了日本的自卫力量。
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is now seeking legislation to enable Japan to reinterpret the constitution to include “collective self-defense,” whereby the country would enhance its security cooperation with other countries, particularly its closest ally, the United States.	如今，首相安倍晋三正在寻求立法让日本重新解释宪法，纳入“集体自卫权 ” ， 使日本能够强化与其他国家，特别是其最紧密盟友美国的联系。
Critics view this as a radical departure from seven decades of pacifism.	批评者认为这严重偏离了七十年来的和平主义。
But Abe’s central objectives – improving Japan’s ability to respond to threats that do not amount to armed attack; enabling Japan to participate more effectively in international peacekeeping activities; and redefining measures for self-defense permitted under Article 9 – are actually relatively modest.	但安倍的核心目标 — — 提高日本响应未达到武装袭击程度的威胁的能力并重新定义宪法第九条所允许的自卫措施 — — 实际上相对比较温和。
Fears that the move would lead to Japanese involvement in distant US wars are similarly overblown.	担心这一举动会导致日本卷入遥远的美国战争同样有过分渲染之嫌。
Indeed, the rules have been carefully crafted to prohibit such adventures, while allowing Japan to work more closely with the US on direct threats to Japanese security.	事实上，精心修改后的规则禁止这样的动作，尽管它允许日本就直接的安全威胁与美国开展更紧密的合作。
It is not difficult to see why Abe is pursuing broader rights to self-defense.	不难看出为何安倍要追求更广泛的集体自卫权利。
Japan lies in a dangerous region, in which deep-rooted tensions threaten to erupt at any moment.	日本位于一个危险的地区，该地区有着根深蒂固的紧张局势，随时可能爆发冲突。
Given that East Asia, unlike Europe after 1945, never experienced full reconciliation among rivals, or established strong regional institutions, it has been forced to depend on the US-Japan Security Treaty to underpin regional stability.	与1945年后的欧洲不同，东亚的诸对立国家从未有过完全的妥协，也没有建立地区机构，而一直依靠美日安保条约（US-Japan Security Treaty）维持地区稳定。
When US President Barack Obama’s administration announced its “rebalancing” toward Asia in 2011, it reaffirmed the 1996 Clinton-Hashimoto Declaration, which cited the US-Japan security alliance as the foundation for stability – a prerequisite for continued economic progress – in Asia.	2011年，美国总统奥巴马政府宣布将“重返”亚洲时重申了1996年克林顿-桥本宣言（ Clinton-Hashimoto Declaration ） 。 该宣言将美日安全同盟称为亚洲稳定的基础和持续经济进步的先决条件。
That declaration served the larger goal of establishing a stable, albeit uneven, triangular relationship among the US, Japan, and China.	这一宣言服务于一个更大的目标：在美国、日本和中国之间建立一个不完全平均但稳定三角关系。
Subsequent US administrations have upheld this approach, and opinion polls show that it retains broad acceptance in Japan – not least owing to close cooperation on disaster relief following the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami of 2011.	随后的几届美国政府都坚持这一方针，而民调显示这在日本人中间也有很高的接受度 — — 不仅是因为2011年东北地震和海啸后的紧密救灾合作。
But Japan remains extremely vulnerable.	但日本仍然十分脆弱。
The most immediate regional threat is North Korea, whose unpredictable dictatorship has invested its meager economic resources in nuclear and missile technology.	最紧迫的地区威胁来自朝鲜，其不可预测的独裁统治将十分有限的军事资源用于核技术和导弹技术。
A longer-term concern is the rise of China – an economic and demographic powerhouse whose expanding military capacity has enabled it to take an increasingly assertive stance in territorial disputes, including with Japan in the East China Sea.	更长期的忧虑是中国崛起。 这个经济和人口超级大国正在扩张军力，使其得以在领土争端中采取日益强硬的立场，包括与日本在东海的岛屿争端。
China’s territorial ambitions are also fueling tensions in the South China Sea, where sea-lanes that are vital to Japanese trade are located.	中国的领土野心也助长了南海的紧张局势，而南海航线对日本贸易来说至关重要。
Complicating matters further is the fact that China’s political evolution has failed to keep pace with its economic progress.	让局面更加复杂的事中国的政治演化跟不上经济进步的步伐。
If the Chinese Communist Party feels threatened by a public frustrated with insufficient political participation and enduring social repression, it could slip into competitive nationalism, upending the already-delicate regional status quo.	如果中共因为公众对政治参与不足和长期社会压迫的不满而感到威胁，就可能滑向竞争性民族主义，颠覆已然摇摇欲坠的地区现状。
Of course, if China becomes aggressive, Asian countries like India and Australia – which are already disturbed by China’s assertiveness in the South China Sea – will join Japan in the effort to offset China’s power.	当然，咄咄逼人的中国将使印度和澳大利亚等亚洲国家 — — 它们已经因为中国在南海的独断专行而愤懑不已 — — 将加入日本，一起遏制中国的实力。
But, as things stand, a strategy of containment would be a mistake.	但是，就目前情况而言，遏制战略将是一个错误。
After all, the best way to engender enmity is to treat China as an enemy.	毕竟，最容易点燃敌意的做法正是将中国作为敌人对待。
A more effective approach, spearheaded by the US and Japan, would focus on integration, with a hedge against uncertainty.	一个更有效的方针是由美国和日本牵头，注重一体化并规避不确定性。
American and Japanese leaders must shape the regional environment in such a way that China has incentives to act responsibly, including by maintaining strong defense capabilities.	美国和日本领导人必须引导地区环境以使中国有动力负责任地行动，维持强大的防御实力是办法之一。
Meanwhile, the US and Japan must rethink the structure of their alliance.	与此同时，美国和日本必须反思联盟结构。
While the expected revisions to Japan’s defense framework are a positive development, many Japanese still resent the lack of symmetry in the alliance obligations.	尽管预期中的日本防务框架调整是积极的发展动态，但许多日本人仍不满于联盟义务的不对等性。
Others chafe at the burden of US bases, particularly on the island of Okinawa.	也有人不满于美军基地（特别是冲绳基地）的负担。
A longer-term goal should thus be for the US gradually to transfer its bases to Japanese control, leaving American forces to rotate among them.	因此，更长期的目标应该是美国逐渐将军事基地转交给日本人控制，而美军则在周围巡航。
In fact, some bases – notably, Misawa Air Base north of Tokyo – already fly Japan’s flag, while hosting American units.	事实上其中一些军事基地 — — 特别是东京以北的三泽空军基地 — — 尽管仍驻扎着美军，但已经竖起了日本旗帜。
But the process must be handled carefully.	但这一过程必须小心控制。
As China invests in advanced ballistic missiles, the fixed bases on Okinawa become increasingly vulnerable.	随着中国投资于先进弹道导弹，冲绳固定军事基地正在变得越来越脆弱。
To avoid the perception that the US decided to turn the bases over to Japan just when their military benefits were diminishing, and to ensure that the move represented America’s recommitment to the alliance, a joint commission would have to be established to manage the transfer.	为了避免让人觉得美国出于军事利益日益消失才把军事基地转交给日本，也为了保证这样做代表了美国对美日同盟关系的重新承诺，必须建立联合委员会管理转交事宜。
For Japan, becoming an equal partner in its alliance with the US is essential to securing its regional and global standing.	对日本来说，成为与日本平等的合作伙伴对于确保其地区和全球地位至关重要。
To this end, Abe’s modest step toward collective self-defense is a step in the right direction.	在这方面，安倍朝向集体自卫权的温和步骤代表着正确方向。
	
JFK Reconsidered	再论肯尼迪
CAMBRIDGE – November 22 will mark the 50th anniversary of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.	美国剑桥—11月22日是约翰·肯尼迪总统遇刺50周年纪念日。
For people alive at the time, it was one of those events that are so shocking that you remember where you were when you heard the news.	对于生活在当时的人来说，这是一桩令人惊心动魄的事件，你能够清楚地记得听到这个消息时在干什么。
I was getting off a train in Nairobi when I saw the dramatic headline.	我是在内罗毕下火车时看到这则爆炸新闻的标题的。
Kennedy was only 46 when he was killed in Dallas by Lee Harvey Oswald, a disgruntled former Marine who had defected to the Soviet Union.	肯尼迪在达拉斯被刺是年仅46岁。 行刺者是一名变节投靠苏联的心怀不满的前海军军人，名叫奥斯瓦尔德（Lee Harvey Oswald ） 。
Though his life had been plagued by illness, Kennedy projected an image of youth and vigor that added to the drama and poignancy of his death.	尽管饱受疾病困扰，但肯尼迪一直以年轻强壮的形象示人，这让他的死平添了几分戏剧性和悲壮。
Martyrdom led many Americans to elevate Kennedy to the ranks of great presidents like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln; but historians have been more restrained in their evaluations.	殉难使得许多美国人把肯尼迪拔高到与乔治·华盛顿和亚伯拉罕·林肯等伟大总统相同高度；但历史学家的评价更加克制。
Critics point to his sometimes reckless sexual behavior; to his scant legislative record; and to his failure to match words with deeds.	批评家指出，肯尼迪有时管不住裤裆；他的立法记录并不怎么样；许下的承诺也没有做到。
While Kennedy spoke about civil rights, tax cuts, and reducing poverty, it was his successor, Lyndon Johnson, who used Kennedy’s martyrdom and his own far more impressive political skills to pass historic legislation in these areas.	尽管肯尼迪大谈公民权利、减税和消除贫困，但利用肯尼迪的殉难以及自身更令人印象深刻的政治技巧在这些领域取得历史性立法突破的乃是肯尼迪的继任者林登·约翰逊。
A 2009 poll of 65 American presidential scholars rated JFK as the sixth most important president, while a recent survey of British experts on American politics put Kennedy in 15th place.	2009年对65位美国总统学者的调查将肯尼迪列为最重要总统第六名；而对英国美国政治专家的最新调查把肯尼迪排在第14名。
Those are impressive rankings for a president who was in office for less than three years, but what did Kennedy really accomplish and how might history have been different if he had survived?	对于一位执政不到三年的总统来说，这样的位次令人印象深刻，但肯尼迪究竟完成了哪些功绩，如果他活下来，历史会有何不同？
In my book Presidential Leadership and the Creation of the American Era, I divide presidents into two categories: those who are transformational in their objectives, pursuing large visions related to major changes; and transactional leaders, who focus more on “operational” issues – ensuring that the metaphorical trains run on time (and stay on the tracks).	在我的著作《总统领导力和美国时代的创建 》 （ Presidential Leadership and the Creation of the American Era）中，我将历届总统分成两类：一类总统追求转型（transformational）性目标，具有与大变革相关的大视野；另一类是事务性（transactional）领袖，专注于“操作性”问题 — — 保证火车按时启动（和停下 ） 。
Because he was an activist and a great communicator with an inspirational style, Kennedy appeared to be a transformational president.	肯尼迪是一个活跃家，拥有极具启发力的伟大共同技巧，因此应该是转型性总统。
He campaigned in 1960 on a promise to “get the country moving again.”	在1960年的选战中，他承诺“让美国重新启动 ” 。
Kennedy’s inaugural address appealed to sacrifice (“Ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your country”).	肯尼迪的就职演说着眼于牺牲 （ “ 不要问你的国家能为你做什么，问问你能为你的国家做什么 ” ） 。
He established programs like the Peace Corps and the Alliance for Progress with Latin America, and he set the United States on a path to landing a man on the moon by the end of the 1960’s.	他成立了和平部队（Peace Props）和与拉丁美洲的进步联盟（Alliance for Progress）等计划；他开启了探月计划，并在20世纪60年代末实现登月。
But, despite his activism and rhetoric, Kennedy was a cautious rather than an ideological personality.	但是，尽管他积极活跃又长于辞令，却很谨慎而不具有思想人格。
As the presidential historian Fred Greenstein put it, “Kennedy had little in the way of an overarching perspective.”	正如总统历史学家格林斯坦（Fred Greenstein）所指出的 ， “ 肯尼迪极少高瞻远瞩 ” 。
Rather than being critical of Kennedy for not living up to his rhetoric, we should be grateful that in critical situations, he was prudent and transactional rather than ideological and transformational.	我们不应该批评肯尼迪行不如言，而应该欣赏肯尼迪能在批评环境中保持审慎，表现出事务性风格，而没有成为空想家和转型性总统。
The most important achievement of Kennedy’s brief presidency was to manage the 1962 Cuban missile crisis and defuse what was probably the riskiest episode since the dawn of the nuclear age.	肯尼迪短暂的总统生涯的最重要成就是解决了1962年古巴导弹危机，平息了有核时代以来最危险的风波。
Kennedy certainly can be blamed for the bungled Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba and the subsequent Operation Mongoose – the covert CIA effort against the Castro regime that convinced the Soviet Union that its ally was under threat.	当然，你可以因为愚蠢的猪湾事件及随后的猫鼬计划（中央情报局针对卡斯特罗政权采取的秘密行动，这使得��联认定其盟友陷入了危险境地）而指责他。
But Kennedy learned from his failure at the Bay of Pigs and created a careful process for managing the crisis that followed the Soviet Union’s placement of nuclear-armed missiles in Cuba.	但肯尼迪吸取了猪湾事件的失败教训，在苏联在古巴部署核武器后，他采取了谨慎的危机处理过程。
Many of Kennedy’s advisers, as well as US military leaders, urged an air strike and invasion, which we now know might have led Soviet field commanders to use their tactical nuclear weapons.	肯尼迪的许多顾问和美国军方领导人敦促他采取空袭和入侵，现在我们知道，这有可能导致苏联指挥官动用战术核武器。
Instead, Kennedy played for time and kept his options open as he negotiated a stand-down with the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev.	相反，肯尼迪玩起了时间游戏，在与苏联领导人赫鲁晓夫谈判休整期间，他一直保持观点的开诚布公。
Judging by Vice President Lyndon Johnson’s hawkish comments at the time, the outcome might have been far worse if Kennedy had not been president.	从副总统林登·约翰逊当时的鹰派评论看，如果总统不是肯尼迪，结果可能会糟糕得多。
Moreover, Kennedy learned from the Cuban missile crisis as well; on June 10, 1963, he gave a speech aimed at easing Cold War tensions.	此外，肯尼迪也从古巴导弹危机吸取了教训；1963年6月10日，他发表了一次旨在平息冷战紧张局势的演讲。
“I speak of peace, therefore, as the necessary rational end of rational men,” he said.	“因此，我要说和平是理性人的必要的理性结局 ， ” 他说。
While a presidential vision of peace was not new, Kennedy followed it up by negotiating the first nuclear arms-control agreement, the Limited Test Ban Treaty.	作为总统，肯尼迪的和平观并不新鲜，但他在和平观的指导下谈判了第一个和武器控制协定 — — 《部分禁止核试验条约 》 （ Limited Test Ban Treaty ） 。
The great unanswered question about Kennedy’s presidency and how his assassination affected American foreign policy is what he would have done about the war in Vietnam.	关于肯尼迪总统生涯以及关于他的被刺如何影响美国外交政策的一个尚未有答案的大问题是他会对越南战争做些什么。
When Kennedy became President, the US had a few hundred advisers in South Vietnam; he increased that number to 16,000.	当肯尼迪成为美国总统时，美国在南越有几百名顾问；他把这个数字扩大到了16 000人。
Johnson eventually raised the number of US troops to more than 500,000.	约翰逊最终把美军数量提高到50多万人。
Many Kennedy supporters claim that he would never have made such a mistake.	许多肯尼迪支持者声称他永远不会犯这样的错误。
But he had supported a coup to replace South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem and left Johnson a deteriorating situation and a group of advisers who counseled against withdrawal.	但他曾支持推翻南越总统吴庭艳的政变，并且他留给约翰逊的是一个烂摊子和反对撤军的顾问团。
Some fervent Kennedy supporters – for example, the historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. and Kennedy’s speechwriter, Theodore Sorensen – have written that Kennedy planned to withdraw from Vietnam after he won re-election in 1964, and claim that Kennedy told Senator Mike Mansfield that that was his plan.	一些肯尼迪的铁杆支持者 — — 比如历史学家小施莱辛格（Arthur Schlesinger, Jr . ） 和肯尼迪的笔杆子索伦森（Theodore Sorensen ） — —写道，肯尼迪计划在1964年连任后从越南撤军，他们还说，肯尼迪告诉曼斯菲尔德（Mike Mansfield）参议员，这就是他的计划。
But skeptics point out that Kennedy always spoke publicly about the need to prevail in Vietnam.	但质疑者指出肯尼迪在公共场合一直都说必须在越南取胜。
The question remains open.	这个问题仍旧是一桩公案。
In my view, Kennedy was a good but not a great president.	在我看来，肯尼迪是个优秀的总统，但不是卓越的总统。
What made him good was not merely his ability to inspire others, but his prudence when it came to complex foreign-policy decisions.	让他优秀的不仅仅是他能够启发他人的能力；而是他在面对复杂外交政策决定时的审慎。
We are fortunate that he was more often transactional than transformational in foreign policy.	他在外交政策上往往显示出更多的事务性而不是转型性风格，此乃幸事。
We are unfortunate that we lost him after only a thousand days.	他在担任总统1000天就离我们而去，此乃不幸。
	
The Return of Japan	日本的回归
TOKYO – “Japan is back!” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared during a visit to Washington, DC, earlier this year.	东京 — — 安倍晋三首相在年初访问华盛顿时曾向外界宣布 “日本回来了 ！ ”
But, while Japan may be on the right track after two decades of economic stagnation, there is still much to be done to secure the country’s long-term future.	不过虽然日本有可能在二十年的经济停滞后重新走上了正轨，但确保国家的长远未来还有许多工作要做。
In July, Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) won control of both houses of parliament – a resounding electoral victory that amounts to the strongest political mandate any Japanese leader has received in many years.	7月，安倍所在的自由民主党（LDP）得到了议会两院的控制权 — — 这次彻底的选举胜利带来了多年以来日本领导人最强的政治权力。
As a result, Abe seems likely to remain in power longer than his ineffectual predecessors, most of whom did not last more than a year.	因此安倍的掌权时间似乎会超过他徒劳无功的前任，他们中的多数人在任时间只有短短1年多。
Meanwhile, Japan’s economy seems to be recovering from a generation of malaise, with this year’s annualized growth rate exceeding 3%.	此外，日本经济似有从一代人的萎靡不振中复苏的迹象，今年的年增长率超过3 % 。
Moreover, following the triple shock of the earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear catastrophe in 2011, Japan has managed (at considerable cost) to replace the 25% of its energy supply that the disabled reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant provided.	不仅如此，在经过2011年地震、海啸及核灾难的三重打击之后，日本（付出极大代价）成功取代了曾由福岛第一核电站报废反应堆提供的25%的能源供应。
The announcement that Tokyo will host the 2020 Olympic Games has also boosted public confidence.	东京将举办2020年奥运会的宣告也提振了公众信心。
Skeptics worry that the economic progress may not last, arguing that the high growth rate is simply a reflection of loose monetary policy and fiscal stimulus – a strategy that inflation will render unsustainable.	持怀疑态度的人担心现在的经济进步可能不会持久，认为较高的增速不过是宽松货币政策和财政刺激的反映 — — 通胀最终会让这项策略不可持续。
Abe’s supporters reply that the third “arrow” of “Abenomics” – productivity-enhancing structural reforms – has only now been removed from its quiver.	安倍的支持者则回应说安倍经济学的第三只“箭 ” — — 提高生产率的结构性改革 — — 现在不过刚刚抽出箭袋而已。
They point to Abe’s ability to overcome resistance from small rice farmers, part of the LDP’s electoral base, to Japan’s participation in negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would open Japan’s economy to increased global competition.	他们指出安倍成功地克服了小稻农的阻力加入到跨太平洋伙伴关系谈判，该谈判会让日本经济面对更为剧烈的国际竞争，而稻农传统上一直是支持自民党的势力。
Nevertheless, Japan faces serious long-term challenges.	尽管如此，日本面临的长期挑战依然严峻。
First, with its birth rate well below replacement level, Japan’s population is aging and shrinking.	首先，因为出生率远低于正常的更新水平，日本人口一直呈现老龄化及萎缩态势。
Offsetting this trend will require increased immigration and greater female labor-force participation – neither of which will be easy to bring about.	平衡这一态势需要更多吸收移民，并让更多女性加入劳动力队伍 — — 实现这两项目标中的哪项都很不容易。
Japan has not traditionally been a country of immigration, and the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report, which ranks 136 countries, has Japan in 105th place.	日本从传统上就不是移民国家，而世界经济论坛的全球性别差距报告总共统计了136个国家，其中日本排在第105位。
But, of course, this can change – and Japan does have a history of successfully reinventing itself.	但毫无疑问这些都可以改变 — — 而日本的确有过成功自我重塑的历史。
Perhaps the most critical question about Japan’s future concerns its relationship with its neighbors – North Korea, South Korea, and China.	事关日本未来最关键的问题或许是与朝鲜、韩国和中国的邻国关系。
While recent polls suggest that Japan retains substantial soft power globally, this is not the case in its immediate neighborhood.	虽然最近的民意调查显示日本在全球范围内仍具有可观的软实力，但与相邻国家的状况却并非如此。
Unlike Europe, where Germany overcame World War II’s legacy through its integration into the European Union, Northeast Asia remains burdened by history.	与德国通过加入欧盟克服二战的遗存影响不同，东北亚仍然背负着沉重的历史。
According to its neighbors, Japan’s apologies for is past aggression are inadequate.	邻国一致认为日本没有足够的诚意为过去的侵略道歉。
It does not help that some Korean and Chinese leaders have used anti-Japanese rhetoric to win domestic support.	某些朝中领导人利用抗日情绪赢得国内支持也加剧了这种情况。
In Japan, the relentless criticism has triggered a nationalist backlash, spurring politicians to respond in kind during last year’s election campaign.	不留情面的批评在日本国内引发了民族主义的反弹，推动政界在去年的竞选活动中做出某种反应。
For example, Abe threatened to rescind the official apologies issued by former leaders or officials for abuses and atrocities committed by Japan’s army during WWII, and stated his intention to visit the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, which honors not only Japan’s war dead, but also many of its war criminals.	比方说，安倍就曾威胁要收回前领导人或官员就日本二战侵害及暴行的正式道歉，并表示打算参拜备受争议的靖国神社，那里不仅供奉着日本的阵亡将士，同时还供奉着很多战犯。
While Abe has not acted on these campaign statements, some observers remain convinced that he will visit Yasukuni at some point, further straining Japan’s relations with South Korea and China.	尽管安倍尚未采取行动兑现这些竞选承诺，但某些观察家仍然相信他将在某一时刻参拜靖国神社，从而导致日本与韩国和中国的关系进一步紧张化。
Territorial disputes have exacerbated these tensions significantly.	领土争端显著加剧了上述紧张局势。
China challenges Japanese control over more than seven square kilometers of islets – called the Senkaku Islands in Japan, and the Diaoyu Islands in China – in the East China Sea.	中国挑战日本对一座7个多平方公里小岛的控制权 — — 这座小岛地处中国东海，日本称之为尖阁列岛，而中国则称之为钓鱼岛。
While the rival claims date back to the late nineteenth century, the latest flare-up – which has included widespread anti-Japanese demonstrations in China – was triggered in September 2012, when Japan’s government purchased three of the tiny islets from their private Japanese owner.	虽然针锋相对的主权之争可以追溯到19世纪末，但最新的事态升级 — — 包括中国举行大规模的反日游行 — — 触发点却是在2012年9月，因为日本政府从私人岛主手中收购了这些小岛中的三座。
Then-Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said that he decided to purchase the islands for the Japanese central government to prevent Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara from purchasing them with municipal funds.	时任首相野田佳彦称他决定由日中央政府购买这些小岛是为防止东京都知事石原慎太郎利用市属资金将其买下。
Noda feared that Ishihara, who was well known for nationalist grandstanding, would try to occupy the islands or find other ways to use them to provoke China.	野田害怕以民族主义著称的石原会占领这些岛屿，或找其他方式利用它们来刺激中国。
But Chinese officials viewed the move as proof that Japan was trying to disrupt the status quo.	但中国官员认为此举恰恰证明日本企图破坏现状。
Some even claimed that Japan was trying to reverse the territorial outcome of WWII.	有人甚至声称日本正试图改变二战后的领土分配格局。
The May 1972 transfer back to Japan of Okinawa, which the United States had administered, included the Senkaku Islands.	1972年5月原来由美国代管的冲绳归还给日本，尖阁列岛也在其中。
A few months later, when China and Japan were working to normalize relations, Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka asked Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai about the islets; Zhou responded that the dispute should be left to later generations, in order to avoid any delay of normalization.	几个月后，当中日两国实现关系正常化时，日本首相田中角荣曾询问中国总理周恩来这些岛屿的归属问题；周回应为避免延误关系正常化，所有争议应留给后代解决。
As a result, both countries maintained their sovereignty claims.	两国因此都保持了主权要求。
So, though Japan has administrative control, Chinese ships and planes frequently enter Japanese waters to assert China’s claim.	因此虽然日本手握行政控制权，中国的舰艇和飞机会频频进入日本领海，以显示中国的领土要求。
While Japan’s security treaty with the US serves as a deterrent, there is always a danger of miscalculation.	虽然日美安全条约一直在发挥威慑力量，但误判形势的风险却始终没有消除。
A quick resolution of the Senkaku Islands dispute (or of Japan’s lower-profile conflict with South Korea over the Korean-controlled Liancourt Rocks) is improbable, but Japan could be more proactive.	快速解决尖阁群岛争端（抑或没那么显眼的日本和韩国就韩属独岛的争端）是不可能的，但日本却可以更加主动。
For example, by stating their willingness to take any territorial disputes to the International Court of Justice, Japanese authorities could help to dispel perceptions of militarism.	比方说，借声明愿意把任何领土争端交由国际法院仲裁，日本政府或许可以消除军国主义的名声。
Furthermore, Japan should take the sovereign act of designating the Senkaku Islands as an international maritime preserve free of habitation or military use.	此外，日本应行使主权将尖阁群岛划为不允许居住或军事用途的国际海上保护区。
China might not agree, but such a move might at least return the issue to the back burner, while reinforcing Japan’s image as a peaceful power.	中国可能不赞同这种做法，但此举可能至少能让领土争端回到次要位置，并同时巩固日本和平大国的形象。
Japan and Northeast Asia need bold initiatives that focus on the future.	日本和东北亚地区需要采取着眼未来的大胆举措。
It is time to give history a rest.	是时候让历史成为历史了。
	
The Myth of Isolationist America	孤立主义美国的神话
CAMBRIDGE – Is the United States turning inward and becoming isolationist?	美国剑桥—美国正在内向化和孤立主义化吗？
That question was posed to me by a number of financial and political leaders at the recent World Economic Forum at Davos, and was heard again a few days later at the annual Munich Security Conference.	在最近的达沃斯世界经济论坛上，很多金融和政治领袖想我提出了这样一个问题，在几天后举行的慕尼黑安全会议上也是如此。
In a strong speech at Davos, Secretary of State John Kerry gave an unambiguous answer: “Far from disengaging, America is proud to be more engaged than ever.”	在达沃斯，国务卿克里发表了强力演说，毫不含糊地指出 ： “ 美国绝没有减少参与，反而因为比从前更多地参与而自豪 。 ”
Yet the question lingered.	但这一问题仍没有得到解答。
Unlike the mood at Davos a few years ago, when many participants mistook an economic recession for long-term American decline, the prevailing view this year was that the US economy has regained much of its underlying strength.	在几年前的达沃斯，许多参与者都把经济衰退误认为美国的长期衰落，与此不同的是，今年的普遍感觉是美国经济重新获得了大部分基础优势。
Economic doomsayers focused instead on previously fashionable emerging markets like Brazil, Russia, India, and Turkey.	经济末日论者转而关注此前的大热门巴西、俄罗斯、印度和土耳其等新兴市场。
The anxiety about US isolationism is driven by recent events.	对美国孤立主义的担忧的背后是最近发生的一系列事件。
For starters, there is America’s refusal (thus far) to intervene militarily in Syria.	首先，美国（到目前为止）拒绝对叙利亚进行军事干预。
Then there is the coming withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan.	其次是美国即将从阿富汗撤军。
And President Barack Obama’s cancellation of his trip to Asia last autumn, owing to domestic political gridlock in the US Congress and the resulting government shutdown, made a poor impression on the region’s leaders.	此外，奥巴马在去年春天因为美国国会政治僵局及其导致的政府关门而取消了亚洲之行，这给地区领导人造成了不良的印象。
Indeed, with Kerry’s time and travel focused on the Middle East, many Asian leaders believe that Obama’s signature foreign policy – strategic “rebalancing” toward Asia – has run out of steam, even as tension between China and Japan, evident in their leaders’ statements at Davos, continues to mount.	事实上，克里的精力和行程都集中在中东，这让很多亚洲领导人认为奥巴马的招牌外交政策 — — 战略性地转向亚洲、实现“再平衡 ” — —已是明日黄花，尽管中国和日本之间的紧张态势仍在发酵，从双方领导人在达沃斯的言论便可见一斑。
Particularly egregious from the point of view of “Davos” was the recent refusal by Congress to approve the reform and refunding of the International Monetary Fund, even though a plan that added no significant burden to the American taxpayer had been agreed years earlier by the G-20 under Obama’s leadership.	在“达沃斯”视角看来，最令人担心的莫过于最近国会拒绝国际货币基金组织（IMF）的改革和再融资，尽管这一计划并没有给美国纳税人造成重大的额外负担，并且在几年前就已经得到了奥巴马所领导的G-20的同意。
When I asked a prominent Republican senator why Congress had balked at keeping an American commitment, he attributed it to “sheer orneriness,” reflecting the mood of right-wing Tea Party Republicans and some left-wing Democrats.	我问一位显赫的共和党参议员，为何国会不让美国作出承诺，他表示这 “纯属故意刁难 ” ， 反映的是右倾的茶党共和党和一些左倾民主党的思维。
Further evidence of American isolationism can be found in a recent opinion poll taken by the Pew Research Center and the Council on Foreign Relations.	更多的美国孤立主义证据可以从皮尤研究中心（Pew Research Center）和外交关系委员会（Council of Foreign Relations）的最新民调中看出。
According to the survey, fifty-two percent of Americans believe that the US “should mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.”	这项调查表明，52%的美国人认为美国“应该以国际视角考虑其自身的商业，让其他国家自己决定最好的应对方式 ” 。
About the same number said that the US is “less important and powerful” than it was a decade ago.	同样比例的美国人认为美国比几十年前“更加不重要、更加不强大”了。
The problem with these perceptions – both at home and abroad – is that the US remains the world’s most powerful country, and is likely to remain so for decades.	这些感觉（不论在国内还是在国外）的问题在于美国仍是世界最强��的国家，并且可能在未来几十年中都是如此。
China’s size and rapid economic growth will almost certainly increase its relative strength vis-à-vis the US.	中国的规模和快速经济增长几乎必然会增加它相对于美国的优势。
But even when China becomes the world’s largest economy in the coming years, it will still be decades behind the US in terms of per capita income.	但即使中国在未来几年中成为世界最大经济体，其人均收入要想超过美国还需要几十年之久。
Moreover, even if China suffers no major domestic political setback, projections based on GDP growth alone are one-dimensional and ignore US military and soft-power advantages. They also ignore China’s geopolitical disadvantages within Asia.	此外，即使中国不在爆发国内政治倒退，基于GDP一个维度的预测也忽视了美国的军事和软实力优势，也忽视了中国在亚洲的地缘政治劣势。
America’s culture of openness and innovation will ensure its role as a global hub in an age when networks supplement, if not fully replace, hierarchical power.	美国的开放和创新文化将确保其在网络大大影响（如果不是完全取代的话）层级制权力的时代的全球枢纽地位。
The US is well positioned to benefit from such networks and alliances, if American leaders follow smart strategies.	美国的地位让它十分便于从这样的网络和盟友关系中获益，只要美国领导人战略明智。
In structural terms, it matters greatly that the two entities in the world with economies and per capita income similar to the US – Europe and Japan – are both American allies.	在结构性问题上，经济和人均收入与美国相近的两个经济体 — — 欧洲和日本 — — 都是美国的盟友，这十分重要。
In terms of balance-of-power resources, that boosts America’s net position, but only if US leaders maintain these alliances and ensure international cooperation.	从实力平衡资源角度看，这有利于美国的净地位，但有一个前提 — — 美国领导人维持好这些同盟关系并确保国际合作。
Decline is a misleading metaphor for today’s America, and Obama fortunately has rejected the suggestion that he should pursue a strategy aimed at managing it.	衰落是对当代美国的错误解读，所幸奥巴马没有接受关于他应该追求遏制美国衰落的战略。
As a leader in research and development, higher education, and entrepreneurial activity, the US, unlike ancient Rome, is not in absolute decline.	作为研发、高等教育和创业活动方面的领袖，美国和古罗马不同，并没有绝对衰落。
We do not live in a “post-American world,” but we also no longer live in the “American era” of the late twentieth century.	我们没有生活在“后美国世界 ” ， 但也不再生活在二十世纪末的“美国时代 ” 。
In the decades ahead, the US will be “first” but not “sole.”	在未来几十年，美国将是“首要”的，而不是“唯一”的。
That is because the power resources of many others – both states and non-state actors – are growing, and because, on an increasing number of issues, obtaining America’s preferred outcomes will require exercising power with others as much as over others.	这是因为其他国家和非国家行动者的实力源泉正在增长，也是因为在越来越多的问题上，取得美国所中意的结果将日益需要与其他行动者共同运用实力而不是凌驾于其他行动者运用实力。
The capacity of US leaders to maintain alliances and create networks will be an important dimension of America’s hard and soft power.	美国领导人维持同盟、建立网络的能力将是美国硬软实力的一个重要维度。
The problem for US power in the twenty-first century is not just China, but the “rise of the rest.”	美国在二十一世纪所面临的实力问题不仅仅是中国，而是“其他国家的崛起 ” 。
The solution is not isolation, but a strategy of selectivity similar to what President Dwight Eisenhower advocated in the 1950’s.	解决办法不是孤立，而是艾森豪威尔总统在20世纪50年代所提倡的选择战略。
A smart power strategy starts with a clear assessment of limits.	一个明智的战略始于对限度的明确评估。
The preeminent power does not have to patrol every boundary and project its strength everywhere.	超然的实力并不一定要在任何边界上都突出、在每个问题上都建立优势。
That is why Eisenhower prudently resisted direct intervention on the French side in Vietnam in 1954.	正因如此，艾森豪威尔审慎地拒绝在1954年越南战争中站在法国一边出手干预。
Eisenhower was right about something else, too: America’s military strength depends on preservation of its economic strength.	艾森豪威尔还有一个正确的地方：美国的军事优势取决于捍卫其经济优势。
Nation-building at home is not the isolation that critics fear; on the contrary, it is central to a smart foreign policy.	在国内的国家建设并不是批评者所担忧的孤立主义；相反，这是明智外交政策的核心。
A smart strategy would avoid involvement of ground forces in major wars on the Asian continent.	明智的战略将避免派遣地面部队参与亚洲大陆上的大战。
Yet such prudence is not the same as isolationism.	但这一审慎并不等同于孤立主义。
The US needs to combine its soft- and hard-power resources better.	美国需要更好地结合其软实力和硬实力。
As Obama said in his 2014 State of the Union address, “in a world of complex threats, our security depends on all elements of our power – including strong and principled diplomacy.”	奥巴马在2014年国情咨文中指出 ： “ 在充满复杂威胁的世界中，我们的安全取决于我们的实力的所有要素 — — 包括强势的有原则的外交 。 ”
Eisenhower could have said that, and no one would accuse him of being an isolationist.	艾森豪威尔也会这样说，并且每人会因此指责他是孤立主义者。
	
A Western Strategy for a Declining Russia	针对衰落的俄罗斯的西方战略
CAMBRIDGE – The Aspen Strategy Group, a non-partisan group of foreign-policy experts that former US National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and I co-chair, recently wrestled with the question of how to respond to Russia’s actions in Ukraine.	美国剑桥—由前美国国家安全顾问布伦特·斯考克罗夫特（Brent Scowcroft）和我担任联职主席的无党派外交政策专家组织阿斯彭战略集团（Aspen Strategy Group）最近为了如何应对俄罗斯在乌克兰的行为而产生了争议。
And now NATO is wrestling with the same question.	现在，北约也为了这一问题起了争议。
While the West must resist Russian President Vladimir Putin’s challenge to the post-1945 norm of not claiming territory by force, it must not completely isolate Russia, a country with which the West has overlapping interests concerning nuclear security, non-proliferation, anti-terrorism, the Arctic, and regional issues like Iran and Afghanistan.	西方必须阻止俄罗斯总统普京对不使用武力主张领土权利这一1945年后规范的挑战，但也不能完全孤立俄罗斯，西方与俄罗斯在核安全、核不扩散、反恐、北冰洋以及伊朗和阿富汗等地区问题方面有着利益重叠。
Moreover, simple geography gives Putin the advantage in any escalation of the conflict in Ukraine.	此外，地理形势决定了不管乌克兰冲突发生怎样的升级，普京都将拥有优势。
It is natural to feel angry at Putin’s deceptions, but anger is not a strategy.	对于普京的欺骗，感到愤怒是人之常情，但愤怒不是战略。
The West needs to impose financial and energy sanctions to deter Russia in Ukraine; but it also must not lose sight of the need to work with Russia on other issues.	西方需要实施金融和能源制裁以使俄罗斯不敢在乌克兰轻举妄动；但西方也不能无视与俄罗斯在其他问题上合作的需要。
Reconciling these objectives is not easy, and neither side would gain from a new Cold War.	调和这些目标并不容易，而新冷战也不会令任何一方受益。
Thus, it is not surprising that when it came to specific policy recommendations, the Aspen group was divided between “squeezers” and “dealers.”	因此，毫不奇怪，但涉及到具体的政策建议时，阿斯彭集团就分裂为“施压派”和“交易派 ” 。
This dilemma should be put in long-term perspective: What type of Russia do we hope to see a decade from now?	这一困境应该放在长期环境中考察：十年后我们希望看到怎样的俄罗斯？
Despite Putin’s aggressive use of force and blustery propaganda, Russia is a country in decline.	尽管普京滥用武力、大肆宣传，但俄罗斯终究是一个衰落中的国家。
Putin’s illiberal strategy of looking East while waging unconventional war on the West will turn Russia into China’s gas station while cutting off its economy from the Western capital, technology, and contacts that it needs.	普京的偏执政策 — — 向东看，同时对西方发动非常规战争 — — 将把俄罗斯引向中国加油站，同时切断俄罗斯经济与其所需要的西方资本、技术和合同。
Some of Russia’s opponents might welcome the country’s decline on the grounds that the problem will eventually solve itself.	一些俄罗斯的反对者可能乐于见到俄罗斯的衰落，他们认为问题终会自己解决。
But that would be shortsighted.	但这是一种短视的观点。
A century ago, the decline of the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires proved highly disruptive to the international system.	一个世纪前，奥匈帝国和奥斯曼帝国的衰落给国际体系造成了巨大的破坏。
A gradual decline, like that of ancient Rome or eighteenth-century Spain, is less disruptive than a rapid one, but ultimately the best scenario would feature a recovering and rebalanced Russia over the next decade.	缓慢的衰落 — — 如古罗马和十八世纪的西班牙 — — 要比迅速衰落的破坏性小得多，但最终，最佳情形是未来十年俄罗斯以重新平衡的复苏面貌出现。
The evidence of Russia’s decline is pervasive.	俄罗斯衰落的证据数不胜数。
The rise in oil prices at the beginning of the century gave the economy an artificial boost, leading Goldman Sachs to include it among the world’s major emerging markets (one of the “BRICs,” along with Brazil, India, and China).	世纪初的油价上涨给俄罗斯经济带来了人为繁荣，以至于高盛公司将它列为世界主要新兴市场（与巴西、印度和中国共同组成了“金砖四国 ” ） 。
Today, however, that growth has vanished.	但是，如今，如此增长早已不复存在。
Russia’s GDP is about one-seventh the size of America’s, and its per capita income (in purchasing-power-parity terms) of $18,000 is roughly one-third that of the US.	俄罗斯GDP规模大约为美国的七分之一，而18,000美元的人均收入（以购买力平价衡量）大约为美国的三分之一。
Oil and gas account for two-thirds of Russian exports, half of state revenues, and 20% of GDP, whereas high-tech exports represent only 7% of its manufactured exports (compared to 28% for the US).	石油和天然气占据了俄罗斯出口的三分之二、国家收入的一半和GDP的20 % ， 而高科技只占其制造业出口的7 % （ 美国为28 % ） 。
Resources are allocated inefficiently across the economy, with a corrupt institutional and legal structure that impedes private investment.	经济��资源配置毫无效率，腐败的制度和法律结构阻碍着私人投资。
Despite the attractiveness of traditional Russian culture and Putin’s calls to boost Russian soft power, his bullying behavior has sown mistrust.	尽管拥有极具吸引力的传统文化，普京也在要求振兴俄罗斯软实力，但其恃强凌弱的行径已经导致了不信任。
Few foreigners watch Russian films, and no Russian university was ranked in the global top 100 last year.	俄罗斯电影鲜有外国观众，俄罗斯大学也在去年全球百强榜单上不见踪影。
The likelihood of ethnic fragmentation is lower than in Soviet days, but it still remains a problem in the Caucasus.	民族分裂的可能性比苏联时期要小，但仍是高加索地区的一个问题。
Non-Russians comprised half of the Soviet population; they now make up 20% of the Russian Federation and occupy 30% of its territory.	非俄罗斯族大约占苏联人口的一半；现在则占俄罗斯联邦人口的20 % ， 控制着30%的领土。
The public health system is in disarray.	公共卫生体系混乱不堪。
The birth rate is declining, mortality rates have increased, and the average Russian male dies in his early sixties.	出生率在下降，死亡率在上升，俄罗斯男性一般活不过六十出头。
Mid-range estimates by United Nations demographers suggest that Russia’s population may decline from 145 million today to 121 million by mid-century.	联合国人口学家的中间估计表明，到本世纪中叶，俄罗斯人口将从今天的1.45亿下降1.21亿。
But, though Russia at this point appears to be an industrial banana republic, many futures are still possible.	但是，尽管现在的俄罗斯似乎只是个工业香蕉共和国（banana republic ） ， 但其未来仍有巨大的可能。
It has talented human resources, and some sectors, like the defense industry, can produce sophisticated products.	它拥有有才华的人力资源，在国防等领域更是能够制造出先进的产品。
Some analysts believe that with reform and modernization, Russia would be able to surmount its problems.	一些分析师认为，在改革和现代化的推动下，俄罗斯能够克服这些问题。
Former President Dmitri Medvedev, who worried that Russia would fall into the so-called middle-income trap rather than graduate to advanced-country status, laid out plans to do just that.	前总统梅德韦杰夫曾担心俄罗斯将陷入所谓的中等收入陷阱，无法迈入发达国家行列，而他列出的行动计划正是如此。
But little has been implemented, owing to rampant corruption.	但由于无孔不入的腐败，实施方面几无进展。
Under Putin, Russia’s post-imperial transformation has failed, and Russia remains pre-occupied with its place in the world and torn between its historical European and Slavophile identities.	在普京治下，俄罗斯后帝国主义转型宣布失败，俄罗斯仍然全神贯注于其在世界中的位置，在它的欧洲传统和斯拉夫身份之间摇摆。
Putin lacks a strategy for Russia’s long-term recovery and reacts opportunistically – albeit sometimes successfully in the short run – to domestic insecurity, perceived external threats, and the weakness of his neighbors.	普京缺乏从俄罗斯的长远复苏着眼的战略，只是机会主义地对国内不安全形势、其所感受到的外部威胁以及邻国的疲弱做出反应 — — 尽管有时能够取得短期成功。
Russia has thus become a revisionist spoiler of the international status quo – one that seeks to be a catalyst for other revisionist powers.	因此，俄罗斯成了国际现状的修正主义搅局者 — — 寻求成为其他修正主义势力的催化剂。
But an ideology of anti-liberalism and Russian nationalism is a poor source of the soft power that the country needs to increase its regional and global influence.	但反自由主义和俄罗斯民族主义意识形态绝非俄罗斯增强其地区和全球影响力所需要的软实力的好源泉。
Thus, the prospects that a Russian-led Eurasian Union can compete with the European Union are limited.	因此，俄罗斯领导的欧亚联盟要想与欧盟竞争十分困难。
Whatever the outcome of Putin’s revisionism, Russia’s nuclear weapons, oil and gas, skills in cyber technology, and proximity to Europe, will give him the resources to cause problems for the West and the international system.	不管普京修正主义的结果如何，俄罗斯的核武器、石油和天然气、网络科技技能以及与欧洲紧邻的地理位置意味着他有充分的资源给西方和国际体系制造问题。
Designing and implementing a strategy that contains Putin’s behavior while maintaining long-term engagement with Russia is one of the most important challenges facing the international community today.	设计并实施在遏制普京行为同时又保持与俄罗斯的长期关系的战略是当今国际社会所面临的最重要挑战之一。
	
The Hazards Behind the Headlines	新闻头条背后的伤害
LONDON – Not too long ago, the only journalists working in conflict areas who might be afforded protection were those working for wealthy, predominantly Western news organizations.	发自伦敦 — — 就在不久前，在冲突地区工作又能受到保护的只有那些为财力雄厚（且主要是西方）新闻机构工作的记者。
These journalists would attend expensive courses run by former special forces personnel, who trained them to navigate hostile environments. They would be furnished with flak jackets and helmets, and given first aid kits.	这些记者会参加由前特种部队人员执教的昂贵课程以便在敌对环境中活动，还会配备防弹衣，头盔和急救包。
But journalists elsewhere have rarely benefited from this culture of safety.	但其他地方的记者很少能受益于这种安全文化。
From Mexico and Brazil to Pakistan and Somalia, journalists are often murdered with impunity.	从墨西哥，巴西到巴基斯坦，索马里，经常有记者遭到谋杀并最终不了了之。
And more often than not, when the messenger is silenced, so is the message.	而通常情况下，当传递某一新闻的信使被捂住了嘴时，这个新闻也会是同等下场。
For the last 15 years, the International News Safety Institute has been collating a list of journalists who have died on the job. What we have found is shocking: for every ten reporters killed, nine died while on assignment in their home country.	在过去15年中，国际新闻安全研究所一直在整理因工遇难的记者名单，并因此得出了令人震惊的发现：每十名遇难记者中往往有九名是在本国执行采访任务时身亡。
Countless others have had to abandon their homes, jobs, and countries; and those who do stay often live in constant fear for their safety.	还有许多记者被迫逃离自己的住所，工作岗位和国家；而那些留下来的人常常会对自身安全忧虑不已。
In places where corrupt regimes or militant groups want to control the flow of information, journalists have long had to risk being kidnapped or killed.	在腐败政权或军人集团想要控制信息流动的地方，记者长期以来都冒着被绑架或杀害的危险。
But in recent years, this threat has become so great that some countries are now effectively no-go zones for international-media organizations.	但近年来这一威胁变得如此之大，以致某些国家已经沦为了国际媒体组织的禁地。
Western correspondents are aware of these risks when they travel abroad to cover active war zones.	西方记者在出国报道战区新闻时是会提前意识到各类风险的。
But now they confront similar dangers at home.	但如今他们在本国也会面临类似的危险。
Wherever journalists work – whether online or offline – they need to be mindful of more physical, psychological, and digital risks than ever before.	只要记者是在工作（无论在线上还是线下 ） ， 他们都得留意比以往任何时候更多的身体，心理和数字风险。
Terrorist attacks have affected news organizations, particularly in Europe, in unexpected ways.	恐怖袭击事件以意想不到的方式影响了新闻机构，尤其是在欧洲。
Many of those who arrived first at the scene of the Manchester Arena bombing or the massacre at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris had not received the physical training for such eventualities, nor were they emotionally prepared to cover stories where they would be exposed to that degree of trauma.	那些首先到达曼彻斯特体育馆爆炸或巴黎巴塔克兰音乐厅大屠杀现场的记者们既没有接受过应付这类事件的体能训练，也未能在情绪上准备好去报道一个会将他们暴露于一定程度精神创伤的新闻事件。
In response to these events, some newsrooms have started preparing for what they will do if a domestic terrorist attack directly affects their operations.	为了应对这些事件，一些新闻编辑部已经开始准备如果国内恐怖袭击直接影响其运作时的应对预案。
Organizations – including the BBC, the Dutch public service broadcaster NOS, and others across Europe – have plans in place for journalists responding to incidents in their home cities or those directly targeting their newsrooms.	包括英国广播公司，荷兰公共服务广播公和和欧洲其他媒体在内的组织机构都制订了记者报道家乡城市或直接针对媒体本部的事件时的行动计划。
Beyond bullets and bombs, journalists also face increasing psychological threats at home.	除了子弹和炸弹之外，记者也面临着越来越多的本土心理威胁。
In July, a report I co-authored for the International News Safety Institute put a name to one such threat, a phenomenon known as “moral injury.”	7月份，由笔者与其他研究人员为国际新闻安全研究所共同撰写的一份报告将这类威胁定名为“道德伤害 ” 。
The report, published by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford, examined the impact of covering the recent refugee crisis in Europe on members of the media.	这份由牛津大学路透新闻学研究所发表的报告审视了欧洲近期难民危机对媒体报道者的影响。
Reporting on a traumatic story, we found, can have a profound impact on one’s mental health.	我们发现，报道心理创伤性故事可能会对报道者的精神健康产生深远的影响。
Our research noted that feelings of guilt and helplessness can be overwhelming when events “transgress personal moral and ethical values or codes of conduct.”	我们的研究指出，当事件“超越个人道德和价值观或行为准则”时，会令报道者产生压倒性的内疚和无助感。
To guard against the risks of moral injury, we highlighted the importance of education, explaining that, “journalists need to understand that this is the ‘new’ terrain, part of the mental landscape of the profession.”	为了防范道德伤害的风险，我们强调了教育的重要性，解释说“记者需要了解到这是个‘新’领域，也是记者这一行业精神图景的一部分 。 ”
Our report also suggested that organizations should look to provide support to those who needed it, bearing in mind that individuals respond to and recover from trauma in different ways.	我们的报告还建议各媒体机构应该为那些需要的人提供支持，同时考虑到每个人都会对创伤有着不同的回应和复原方式。
In the US, journalists face another kind of psychological threat: harassment from their own government.	在美国，记者面临另一种心理威胁：本国政府的骚扰。
Although journalists are protected by the First Amendment of the US Constitution, US President Donald Trump has nevertheless used his social-media bully pulpit to routinely vilify the entire news media.	虽然新闻工作者受到美国宪法第一修正案的保护，但美国总统特朗普仍然时常用自己的社交媒体欺侮平台来诋毁整个新闻媒体。
Trump’s disdain for free speech mirrors that of authoritarian governments, from Turkey to the Philippines, where journalists have been arrested, imprisoned, and harassed in record numbers.	特朗普对自由言论的蔑视跟土耳其，菲律宾等国的独裁政府如出一辙，而在那些国家记者被拘留，监禁和骚扰的不在少数。
Journalists are also increasingly vulnerable online, where anonymity has created a culture of trolling and harassment.	记者在网络也越来越脆弱，匿名性滋生出了一种散布谣言和骚扰的文化。
Female journalists have had to bear the brunt of digital attacks, which can rapidly escalate into threats of sexual violence.	首当其冲遭遇这些网络袭击的是女性记者，而这些攻击可以迅速升级为性暴力威胁。
In response, many journalists have abandoned social media, and others have left the profession of journalism altogether.	许多记者因此对社交媒体敬而远之，而其他人则彻底离开了新闻行业。
The world is a risky place for journalists, which is precisely why we must do everything that we can to protect them.	这个世界对于记者而言是一个危险的地方，而这也正是我们必须尽全力保护他们的原因。
Never before has the role of journalism been so important.	新闻工作的重要性也从未如此重要。
In today’s noisy, confusing, multi-channel news landscape, where “fake news” is sold as fact, we need accountable, analytical, responsible reporting more than ever.	在今天这个嘈杂，混乱且多渠道，将“假消息”作为事实贩售的新闻图景中，我们比以往任何时候都需要实话实说，分析严谨且负责任的报告。
A free press delivers truth, holds power to account, and calls out threats to liberty and justice.	自由的新闻界能提供真相，让权力问责，并揭露出那些对自由和正义的威胁。
But the press can never be free if its members are not kept safe.	但如果连新闻界的成员都无法保证自己的安全，新闻就永远无法实现自由。
	
Judgment Day for the Eurozone	欧元区审判日
MUNICH – Europe and the world are eagerly awaiting the decision of Germany’s Constitutional Court on September 12 regarding the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the proposed permanent successor to the eurozone’s current emergency lender, the European Financial Stability Mechanism.	慕尼黑—欧洲和世界正在焦急地等待德国宪法法院9月12日对欧洲稳定性机制（ESM）的判决。 ESM是作为欧元区现行紧急贷款人欧洲金融稳定机制（EFSM）的永久性替代方案推出的。
The Court must rule on German plaintiffs’ claim that legislation to establish the ESM would violate Germany’s Grundgesetz (Basic Law).	德国宪法法院必须就德国原告提出的成立ESM的立法决定违反了德国基本法的意见作出裁决。
If the Court rules in the plaintiffs’ favor, it will ask Germany’s president not to sign the ESM treaty, which has already been ratified by Germany’s Bundestag (parliament).	如果裁决有利于原告，那么宪法法院将要求德国总统拒绝在已被德国议会批准的ESM条约上签字。
There are serious concerns on all sides about the pending decision.	各方均对即将到来的裁决严重关注。
Investors are worried that the Court could oppose the ESM such that they would have to bear the losses from their bad investments.	投资者担心德国宪法法院将反对ESM，因此他们将不得不承受坏投资带来的损失。
Taxpayers and pensioners in European countries that still have solid economies are worried that the Court could pave the way for socialization of eurozone debt, saddling them with the burden of these same investors’ losses.	经济仍然坚挺的欧洲国家的纳税人和退休者担心宪法法院的裁决会扫清欧元区债务社会化的障碍，投资者的损失将因此由他们来承担。
The plaintiffs represent the entire political spectrum, including the Left Party, the Christian Social Union MP Peter Gauweiler, and the justice minister in former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder’s Social Democratic government, Herta Däubler-Gmelin, who has collected tens of thousands of signatures supporting her case.	原告代表了整个德国政坛，包括左翼党、基督教社会联盟议员高威勒（Peter Gauweiler）和前总理施罗德的社会民主党政府司法部长道勒-格梅林（Herta Däubler-Gmelin ） ， 后者更是收集了数万人的支持签名。
There is also a group of retired professors of economics and law, and another of “ordinary” citizens, whose individual complaints have been selected as examples by the Court.	还有一群退休经济学和法学教授，以及另外一批“普通”公民，后者的抱怨被德国宪法法院采纳为参考例子。
The plaintiffs have raised several objections to the ESM.	原告提出了诸多反对ESM的原因。
First, they claim that it breaches the Maastricht Treaty’s “no bail-out” clause (Article 125).	首先，他们诉称这违反了马斯特里赫特条约“不救援”条款（第125条 ） 。
Germany agreed to relinquish the Deutsche Mark on the condition that the new currency area would not lead to direct or indirect socialization of its members’ debt, thus precluding any financial assistance from EU funds for states facing bankruptcy.	德国同意放弃德国马克是有条件的，那就是新货币区不能导致其成员国债务的直接或间接社会化，从而排除了任何动用欧盟资金对面临破产的国家进行金融援助的可能性。
Indeed, the new currency was conceived as a unit of account for economic exchange that would not have any wealth implications at all.	事实上，新货币被认为仅仅是经济交换账户的单位，不具有任何财富效应。
The plaintiffs argue that, in the case of Greece, breaching Article 125 required proof that its insolvency would pose a greater danger than anticipated when the Maastricht Treaty was drafted.	原告指出，在希腊的案例中，对马约第125条的违反需要有希腊破产将产生比马约起草时所预料到的情况更大的危险的证明。
However, no such proof was provided.	但是，希腊案例并没有提供这类证明。
Second, Germany’s law on the introduction of the ESM obliges Germany’s representative on the ESM Council to vote only after having asked the Bundestag for a decision.	其次，德国关于引入ESM的法律规定，德国代表在ESM委员会上的投票只有在要求德国央行作出决定后才能进行。
According to the plaintiffs, this is not permissible under international law.	根据原告的说法，这是国际法所不允许的。
If Germany had wished to constrain its governor’s authority in this way, it should have informed the other signatory states prior to doing so.	如果德国意��以此限制其官员的权力，那么它应该在如此行动之前通知其他签署国。
On the other hand, Germany’s representative on the Governing Council is sworn to secrecy, which, the plaintiffs argue, precludes any accountability to the Bundestag.	另一方面，德国在ESM理事会的代表作过保密宣誓，原告指出，这使得德国央行的行为变得无法问责。
Moreover, the plaintiffs claim that, while the ESM treaty is restrictive in granting resources to individual states, requiring a qualified majority vote, it does not specify the conditions under which losses are acceptable.	此外，原告还诉称，尽管ESM条约对于向个体国家提供资源做了限定，要求通过多数票授权，但并没有具体规定可接受损失的条件。
Losses can result from excessive wages paid by the ESM Governing Council members to themselves, a dearth of energy in efforts to collect debts from countries that have received credit, or other forms of mismanagement.	损失可能产生于ESM向其理事会成员支付的工资过高、缺乏获得信用的国家讨债的动力，以及其他形式的管理不当。
And, because Governing Council and Executive Board members enjoy immunity from criminal prosecution, misbehavior cannot be punished.	此外，由于ESM理事会和执行董事会成员享用刑事诉讼豁免权，他们的不当行为无法追究。
If losses arise, they must be covered by the initial cash contribution of €80 billion ($100 billion), which then would be topped up automatically by all participating countries according to their capital shares.	如果产生了损失，那么必须用800亿欧元的初始筹集现金来弥补，而因此用掉的钱将自动由参与过根据各自的资本权重予以补足。
If individual countries are no longer able to make the necessary contributions, others must do so on their behalf.	如果有的国家无力履行必要的资金提供义务，其他国家必须替它们完成。
In principle, a single country might have to assume the entire burden of losses.	从理论上说，可能出现一个国家承担整个损失负担的情况。
Such joint and several liability, the plaintiffs assert, contradicts the Court’s previous statements that Germany should not accept any financial commitments stemming from other states’ behavior.	原告指出，如此连带责任违反了德国宪法法院先前关于德国不应接受因他国而起的金融承诺的裁决。
Worse, according to the plaintiffs, although the liability of any country vis-à-vis external partners is limited to that country’s share of capital, this limitation does not apply to other signatory states.	更糟糕的是，根据原告所诉，尽管任何国家对外部伙伴的债务被限制在该国资本权重之内，但这一限制并不适用于其他签署国。
It is theoretically possible that a single country could be held liable for the ESM’s total exposure of €700 billion.	从理论上说，有可能出现一个国家不得不承担ESM所有风险暴露（7000亿欧元）的情况。
Finally, the ESM cannot be considered on its own, but must be seen in the context of the total exposure amount, which includes the €1.4 trillion in bailout funds that have already been granted.	最后，ESM问题不能只从ESM本身着眼，而是必须考虑到总风险暴露规模，其中包括已经用出去的1.4万亿欧元援助资金。
In particular, the Target2 credit drawn by the crisis-afflicted countries’ central banks, which already totals almost €1 trillion, should also be taken into consideration.	特别是，拨给危机影响国央行的Target2信用（总数已达近1万亿欧元）必须考虑在内。
Nobody knows how the Constitutional Court will rule on these objections.	没人知道德国宪法法院将如何裁决这些反对。
Most observers believe that the Court is unlikely to oppose the ESM treaty, though many expect the judges to demand certain amendments, or to ask Germany’s president to make his signature subject to certain qualifications.	大部分观察者认为德国宪法法院不可能反对ESM条约，但许多人预期最后判决将要求ESM条约进行一定的修改，或者要求德国总统必须在满足一定条件才能签字。
It is good that the Court’s decisions cannot be forecast, and even better that the Court cannot be lobbied or petitioned.	裁决结果无法预测，这是件好事，特别是考虑到德国宪法法院不为游说和请愿所动。
The European Union can be based only on the rule of law.	欧盟的唯一基石只能是法治精神。
If those in power can break its rules on a case-by-case basis, the EU will never develop into the stable construct that is a prerequisite for peace and prosperity.	如果当权者可以在每一庄案例中破坏欧盟规则，那么欧盟将永远不可能发展成和平和繁荣所必须的稳定大厦。
	
The OPEC Oil Embargo at 40	欧佩克石油禁运40年
DENVER – Forty years ago, the United States and much of Europe learned difficult lessons about their dangerous addiction to fossil fuels.	丹佛 — — 四十年前，美国和欧洲绝大部分国家因为对化石燃料的危险依赖而得到了教训。
Following Israel’s victory in the Yom Kippur War, the Arab members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) announced an oil embargo on Israel’s supporters.	继以色列赎罪日战争获得胜利后，石油输出国（欧佩克）组织阿拉伯成员国宣布对支持以色列的国家实行石油禁运。
Developed countries, faced with the sudden cutoff of a key energy source and a major spike in world oil prices, felt powerless.	面对主要能源供应的突然中止及世界油价的大幅上涨，发达国家感到前所未有的力不从心。
But, as it turned out, developed countries did have options for reducing their dependence on Arab oil.	但事实表明发达国家有能力降低对阿拉伯石油的依赖。
They just had not recognized – or had not cared to recognize – the need for action until OPEC had them over a barrel.	他们只不过还没意识到 — — 也可能是不愿承认 — — 遭到欧佩克的石油绑架前有这个必要。
While consumers waited in long lines – and even fought – to fill their gas tanks, governments attempted to encourage innovative solutions by, for example, raising efficiency requirements for automobiles and certain appliances, like refrigerators.	当消费者排长队等候 — — 甚至为了加满油箱而发生斗殴时，政府却在鼓励创新方案，比方说提高汽车和冰箱等某些电器的能效要求。
In 1977, the US created the Department of Energy (DOE); a year later, it enacted the National Energy Act, which employed tools like industrial regulation and tax incentives to promote fuel efficiency and renewable energy.	美国能源部于1977年创立；一年后颁布了《国家能源法 》 ， 采用行业法规及税收优惠政策等工具来推动可再生能源发展、提高燃油效率。
These efforts led to major improvements in energy efficiency.	上述努力极大地改善了能效。
From 1973 to 1985, US energy consumption per dollar of GDP declined by 28% – five times faster than during the previous quarter-century, according to the DOE.	从1973年到1985年，美国单位美元GDP能耗下降28 % — —按照能源部的说法，比之前的25年速度快5倍。
But the corresponding decline in demand caused the price of oil to plummet in 1986, ushering in a new era of cheap energy.	但由此带来的需求下降导致1986年石油价格暴跌，开启了廉价能源的新时代。
This facilitated a two-decade-long economic boom, while reducing pressure on governments to sustain the momentum of progress toward greater energy efficiency.	由此促成了长达二十年之久的经济繁荣，同时大大缓解了政府继续保持能效进步的压力。
But oil prices do not reflect the true costs of fossil-fuel consumption.	但石油价格并不反映化石燃料消费的真实成本。
Beyond the economic and human costs of wars fought to maintain reliable oil supplies are the tremendous costs – which are set to rise substantially in the coming years – associated with human-induced climate change.	除为确保可靠石油供应而发动战争的经济和人力成本外还有与人类活动引起气候变化相关的重大成本 — — 今后若干年内此类成本一定会大幅提高。
The recently released Fifth Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides further evidence that human-induced climate change is happening.	最近发布的联合国政府间气候变化专业委员会（IPCC）第五次评估报告进一步表明由人类活动引起的气候变化正在发生。
Continued greenhouse-gas emissions on the massive scale of today would have devastating consequences, including more frequent and more intense weather events.	今天的持续大规模温室气体排放可能造成包括更频繁、更剧烈天气事件在内的灾难性后果。
Reversing this trend demands urgent action.	扭转这种颓势需要采取紧急行动。
As was true in the 1970’s, innovation is the key to effective solutions.	与20世纪70年代时一样，有效方案的关键依然是创新。
But, unlike 40 years ago, governments cannot be expected to drive progress.	但不同于40年前的是这次不能再指望政府推动技术进步。
In recent years, governments have clearly demonstrated their lack of willingness to pursue the kind of bold policies and regulatory action that are needed to curb climate change.	近年来，政府已经清楚地表明他们不愿执行遏制气候变化所需的大胆政策及监管行动。
Indeed, since world leaders failed to achieve a climate-change agreement at the COP15 conference in Copenhagen in 2009, the issue has remained on the back burner, with policymakers focusing instead on containing the fallout of the global economic crisis.	其实从各国领导人未能在2009年的哥本哈根COP15会议上达成气候变化协议后，这个问题就一拖再拖，因为决策者都在全力关注遏制全球经济危机的后果。
The recent budget gridlock in the US will only reinforce this approach.	美国最近的预算僵局只能让这样的局面进一步巩固。
While many would welcome top-down solutions like those that emerged in the 1970’s, such outcomes are unlikely in the foreseeable future.	虽然不少人都欢迎20世纪70年代那样自上而下的方案，但在可以预见的未来不太可能实现这样的结果。
Fortunately, there is another way.	幸运的是还有其他办法。
Business-led innovation and market-based solutions can drive a decisive global shift from crippling fossil-fuel dependency to more efficient renewable-energy systems.	企业主导创新和市场化解决方案可以驱动从化石燃料依赖到更高效可再生能源系统决定性的全球转化。
Rocky Mountain Institute’s Reinventing Fire analysis shows that such a future is possible, offering market-driven strategies for powering a US economy that is 158% larger in 2050 – without reliance on oil, coal, or nuclear energy.	落基山研究所的《革新之火》分析报告表明在不依赖石油、煤炭或核能的情况下，为2050年增长达158%的美国经济提供市场化能源战略是完全可能的。
Swift and determined action to make buildings more energy-efficient, design automobiles that require little or no fossil fuels, and increase the share of renewable energy in the electricity supply could ensure that the substantially hotter and less pleasant world of 2050 that the IPCC warns against does not materialize.	迅速果断地采取建筑节能、设计少用或不用化石燃料汽车、提高可再生能源供电比重等行动可以确保IPCC警告过的2050年令人不快的炎热世界不会真的发生。
Our livelihoods, not to mention those of future generations, should not be held hostage by our ongoing addiction to fossil fuels.	我们对于化石燃料的持续依赖不应威胁到自己和子孙后代的生存。
Four decades ago, countries not only endured the immediate economic impact of the OPEC embargo; they leveraged the potential of the resulting oil shortages to spur innovation.	四十年前，各国不光承担了欧佩克禁运对经济的直接影响；他们还利用由此产生的石油短缺来刺激创新潜能。
Today, the world needs the same kind of bold action – but this time, it is up to the market to provide it.	今天，世界同样需要这样的大胆行动 — — 但这次需要由市场来驱动。
	
The Dred Scott of Climate Change?	气候变化的德雷德·斯科特案？
WASHINGTON, DC – In 2015, 21 young people between the ages of 11 and 22 filed a major lawsuit against the US government for failing to limit the effects of climate change.	华盛顿—2015年，21位11—21岁间的年轻人对美国经济发起了诉讼，指责他们没能遏制气候变化的影响。
In Juliana v. United States, the plaintiffs argue that because they will have to live with the repercussions of global warming for much longer than anyone else, on average, the government’s failure to protect the environment violates their constitutional rights to equal protection under the law and due process.	在朱莉安娜诉美国案（Juliana v. United States）中，控方认为，因为他们不得不比其他所有人承受全球变暖的影响更长时间，所以政府在保护环境方面的不力侵犯了他们收到法律和正当程序的平等保护的宪法权利。
The philosopher Peter Singer points out that this case represents a historical turning point, because it addresses the rights of children and future Americans to a livable environment.	哲学家彼得·辛格（Peter Singer）指出，本案代表了一个历史转折点，因为它直指儿童和威力爱美国人获得适合生活的环境的权利。
But the trial is about more than the environment; it will have far-reaching implications for intergenerational justice more broadly.	但裁决并不只是关乎环境；它将对更广泛的代际正义（intergenerational justice）造成深远影响。
Consider the issue of public debt.	以公共债务问题为例。
There have always been moral objections to one generation burdening the next with excessive debt, effectively limiting young people’s future liberty by impinging on their ability to form families, educate children, and create wealth.	对于某一代人把过度负债的负担甩给下一代人，影响到年轻人组建家庭、教育子女和积累财富的能力，大大限制他们的未来自由的做法，总是会产生道德反对。
With US federal deficits rising toward $1 trillion a year, the issue is becoming cripplingly urgent.	美国联邦债务正在向每年1万亿美元靠拢，这一问题也变得越来越紧迫。
In deciding Juliana v. United States, the Supreme Court must grapple with the fact that the US Constitution does not explicitly recognize future citizens.	在朱莉安娜诉美国案的裁决中，最高法院必须抓住一个事实，即美国宪法并未明确承认未来公民。
While it was the first of many national constitutions to embody the Enlightenment principles that citizens are equal under the law and endowed with unalienable rights, it applies those principles only to living Americans.	法律面前人人平等，公民拥有不可剥夺的权利，美国宪法是第一批将这些启蒙运动原则写入其中的众多国家宪法之一，但这些原则只适用于活着的美国人。
Future US citizens will have rights only after they are born.	未来美国公民只有当他们降生后，才能拥有权利。
That might sound reasonable.	这听起来十分合理。
But if the interests of future Americans are not protected, powerful actors today can drain resources from the not-yet-born.	但如果未来美国人的利益得不到保护，今天的强力行动者就可能从尚未出生的公民手中抢夺资源。
The result is environmental degradation, unsustainable public debt, and generations of under-educated, unemployable people who will have difficulty raising their own children to become productive adults.	结果将是环境破坏、不可持续的公共债务，以及几代教育程度低、找不到工作的人难以将自己的孩子培养为有生产力的成年人。
One modern country does recognize this risk in its constitution: Germany.	有一个现代国家在其宪法中承认了这一风险：德国。
Article 20a of Germany’s Grundgesetz (Basic Law) stipulates that, “Mindful also of its responsibility toward future generations, the state shall protect the natural foundations of life and animals by legislation and, in accordance with law and justice, by executive and judicial action…”	德国宪法（基本法）第20条a款，规定 “国家亦须谨记对子孙后代的责任，应该通过立法以及通过与法律和争议相符的行政和司法行为，保护生命和动物的自然基础 … … ”
By demonstrating that younger living citizens suffer more than their older counterparts from short-sighted fiscal and environmental policies, Juliana could be the first step toward recognizing a similar responsibility in the US.	朱莉安娜认为年轻的活着的公民比年长同胞承受短视的财政和环境政策的后果更多，这可能成为美国承认类似责任的第一步。
It is a small step, but one that could have far-reaching implications for policy, especially at a time when the president and his administration are actively pursuing policies that effectively loot the next generation.	这是一小步 ， ， 但可能对政策产生深远影响，特别是在总统及其政府积极地推行洗劫下一代的政策的时候。
And, indeed, US President Donald Trump’s administration has resisted the case at every turn.	而事实上，美国总统特朗普政府也确实在每一个回合都抵制这起案件。
Earlier this year, a lower court ruled that the case could go to trial, and the trial was set to begin at the US District Court in Oregon, on October 29.	今年早些时候，一家较低级别法院裁定本案可进入庭审，并安排于10月29日在俄勒冈地方法院开庭。
But in late September, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts issued a temporary stay of the case to consider a request from the Justice Department to halt it altogether – a highly unusual move.	但在9月份，最高法院首席大法官约翰·罗伯茨（John Roberts）临时叫停该案，要求考虑司法部中止该案的要求 — — 这是极不寻常的举动。
Fortunately, the Supreme Court decided to deny the government’s request and let the trial move forward.	幸运的是，最高法院否决了政府的要求，庭审可以继续进行。
But the Trump administration is not giving up: it has now filed dismissal appeals with the US District Court in Oregon and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco.	但特朗普政府没有放弃：上诉要求驳回俄勒冈地区法院和旧金山第九上诉巡回法院的起诉。
Trump administration attorneys insist that the case is “nonjusticiable,” meaning that the courts are not the proper venue to resolve the issues in Juliana; even if this was not the case, they continue, the plaintiffs lack standing to sue.	特朗普政府的律师坚持该案“不可由法院裁决 ” ， 即法院不是解决朱莉安娜案问题的合理地点；即使并非如此，他们继续指出，控方也缺少起诉依据。
The US federal courts from the district level up to the Supreme Court – all of which have already ruled that the case should go to trial – clearly disagree.	从地方法院到最高法院的美国联邦法院体系 — — 均裁定本案应该进入庭审 — — 予以明确回绝。
There are parallels between Juliana v. United States and the Supreme Court’s infamous decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford.	朱莉安娜诉美国案与最高法院声名狼藉的德雷德·斯科特诉斯坦福案（Dred Scott v. Sandford）裁决有相似之处。
Scott, a slave, sued for his and his family’s freedom in 1857 – eight years before the US Constitution’s 13th Amendment abolished slavery.	斯科特是一名奴隶，在1857年起诉要求还自己和家庭以自由 — — 此时距离美国宪法第十三修正案废除奴隶制还有八年。
Chief Justice Roger B. Taney ruled that slaves and their descendants were “beings of an inferior order” who had “no rights which the white man was bound to respect.”	首席大法官罗杰·塔尼（Roger B. Taney）裁定奴隶及其后代是“劣等生物 ” ， 他们“没有白人所理应得到尊重的权利 。 ”
Scott, therefore, had no standing to sue in federal court.	因此，斯科特没有资格在联邦法院发起诉讼。
Will Kelsey Juliana, the chief plaintiff in the federal suit, also be denied?	联邦案件主控方凯尔西·朱莉安娜（Kelsey Juliana）也会被拒绝吗？
Already, in the US Supreme Court’s comments about Juliana, there are echoes of Dred Scott.	在美国最高法院对朱莉安娜案的评价中，已经有了德雷德·斯科特案的影子。
Ultimately, however, the Dred Scott ruling was out of touch not only with basic morality, but also with the growing economic and cultural power of the North and the direction of US history.	但说到底，德雷德·斯科特案的裁决既不符合基本道德，也不符合日益崛起的北方经济和文化实力以及美国历史的前进方向。
That is what we are seeing today, both in the Trump administration’s claims that Juliana is nonjusticiable, and in US law’s antiquated failure to recognize future Americans’ rights to a livable environment, unburdened by excessive debt.	我们在今天也看到了这种情况，特朗普政府所谓的朱莉安娜案不可由法院裁决，以及美国法律落后于时代地不承认未来美国人拥有适合生活的环境、不必承担过重债务的权利，都是如此。
Opponents of Juliana, including the politically influential energy industry, cynically hope that they can succeed in getting the case dismissed and put generational rights in the hands of a deeply divided – and, for powerful vested interests, pliable – Congress.	朱莉安娜案的反对者，包括政治影响力很强的能源业，犬儒地希望他们能够成功驳回案件，将代际权利交到深度分裂的 — — 以及符合权势既得利益的柔软易控的 — — 国会手中。
Like the opponents of emancipation in the 1850s, they count success in terms of the few months or years they can continue to benefit from the Constitution’s lacunae.	就像19世纪50年代释放奴隶的反对者，他们对成功的算计是能够从宪法的漏洞中获益几个月或几年。
And they may well be able to hold onto the past a little longer.	他们很可能能够将历史拖一会儿。
When it came to abolishing slavery, the US trailed the United Kingdom by more than 30 years – a delay that only made matters worse in the mid-1800s.	在废奴问题上，美国落后英国30多年 — — 到了19世纪，这一拖延让情况进一步恶化。
But the direction of history is clear.	但历史的方向是明确的。
The tide is turning against permitting living citizens to exploit their children and grandchildren.	放任活着的公民剥削他们的子辈和孙辈是逆潮流而动。
In this sense, whatever the outcome, Juliana v. United States is just the beginning.	从这个角度讲，不管朱莉安娜诉美国案结果如何，都将只是一个开始。
	
Mandela’s Children	曼德拉的孩子
NAIROBI – Before I knew that Nelson Mandela existed, I thought our then-leader, Kenyan President Daniel Toroitich arap Moi, was the world’s only statesman.	发自内罗毕 — — 在我知道有尼尔森·曼德拉这个人存在之前，我觉得自己国家的领袖，时任肯尼亚总统的丹尼尔·阿拉普·莫伊（Daniel Toroitich arap Moi）是世界上唯一的政治家。
I was five years old, and no world existed for me outside Nairagie Enkare, my birthplace in rural Maasailand.	当时我才五岁，对我来说除了出生地 — — 马赛地（Maasailand）乡下的Nairagie Enkare地区 — — 之外的世界是一片空白。
Moi was a mythical figure to me, because he didn’t live in Nairagie Enkare, yet he was always present through radio, a technology too complicated for a child like me to understand.	莫伊只是我心目中一个虚构的人物，因为他并不住在Nairagie Enkare地区，但他经常在收音机里出现，而收音机这种高科技对一个孩子来说实在太难理解了。
Every newscast from the government-controlled radio station began with what “His Excellency, Holy President Daniel Toroitich arap Moi” had said or done.	来自政府电台的每一条新闻都是关于“尊敬而神圣的总统丹尼尔·阿拉普·莫伊”干了或说了些什么。
He visited a school. He planted a tree.	他到哪儿访问了一所学校，又去哪儿种了一棵树。
He helped a women’s group.	他扶助妇女组织。
He attended church.	他进教堂作礼拜。
He said agriculture was the backbone of our nation.	他说农业是我们国家的主心骨。
He said we were fortunate to live in Kenya.	他说我们能生活在肯尼亚是很幸福的一件事。
Throughout the day, the airwaves were filled with songs repeating the Father of the Nation’s message, and reminding Kenyans to follow in his footsteps.	一天到晚，电波里都充斥着一些传达国父教诲的歌曲，并提醒国民要追随他的脚步。
Perhaps because what came over the radio was so predictable, people sought alternative news from the BBC Swahili Service.	或许以为早已对电台里的说辞滚瓜烂熟了，人们转而收听英国广播公司（BBC）的斯瓦西里语频道。
On most evenings, at six o’clock, men gathered to listen at the homes of the few, like my father, who had radios.	每到晚上6点的时候，男人们就聚在那几个有电台的人家 — — 比如我家 — — 来收听节目。
The news lasted only 30 minutes, so everyone had to be absolutely quiet.	新闻只会播放半个小时，因此每个人都必须保持极端安静。
But, on February 11, 1990, the men began to say repeatedly, “He is free! He is free!	但在某一天（我后来才知道是1990年2月11日 ） ， 人们开始不断重复着一句话 ： “ 他自由了，尼尔逊·曼德拉自由了 ！ ”
Nelson Mandela is free!”	
I’m sure that my father and his friends had heard earlier from government radio that Mandela had been released, but they waited for verification from the BBC.	我确信父亲和他的朋友们早就在政府电台中听到了曼德拉获释的消息，但他们需要等BBC来确证这一点。
They left before the news was over to go to a bar to celebrate.	还没等到新闻播完，他们就冲到一家酒吧开始了庆祝。
When my father came home that night, he was singing praises for Mandela.	当我父亲当晚回到家的时候还高唱歌颂曼德拉的歌。
I never asked my father who Mandela was.	不过我从来没问他曼德拉究竟是谁。
The following year, I enrolled in school and began to learn that the world extended beyond Nairagie Enkare.	接着那年，我开始读书并发现原来世界不止是Nairagie Enkare那么大。
My teachers explained to me why Mandela’s freedom, after 27 years in prison, meant so much to Africans – from big cities to small villages.	我的老师向我解释为何曼德拉在被囚禁27年后的获释对非洲人 — — 无论是城市居民还是乡野村夫 — — 来说是如此重要
Europeans, I learned, had colonized Africa and stripped Africans of the right to self-governance.	我学到，欧洲人把非洲变成了殖民地并剥夺了非洲人的自治权。
As African countries began to gain independence in the 1950’s, the white minority in South Africa was tightening its grip on power through a racial-segregation system known as apartheid. It was Mandela’s fight against apartheid that led to his imprisonment.	随着非洲国家自1950年代以来先后获得独立，在南非的白人少数派政府开始利用一套名为种族隔离的体制来维护自己的手中权力，而曼德拉正是因��抗这一体制入狱的。
By 1980, black Africans had taken over governance in every country on the continent except South Africa.	在1980年，除了南非之外的所有非洲黑人都获得了自治权。
Mandela’s release from prison ten years later moved Africa one step closer to absolute independence.	而曼德拉在十年后的获释则使非洲更进一步实现了一种近乎完全独立的状态。
That mission was completed in 1994, when apartheid fell and South Africans chose Mandela as their first democratically elected president.	这个使命最终在1994年完成，种族隔离制度终于崩溃，南非人也将曼德拉选为本国首位民选总统。
As I learned more about Mandela, I wondered how he had achieved the unimaginable, overcoming a 27-year ordeal to become the leader of Africa’s largest economy.	随着我对曼德拉了解越多，我就越想知道他是如何完成这个不可想象的任务，熬过了27年牢狱并最终成为非洲最大经济体的总统。
And, just when I thought that he had already made his mark on history, he shocked the world by announcing that he would not seek re-election after the end of his first term in 1999.	而当我认为他已经创造了历史的时候，曼德拉却再次震惊了世界，宣布自己将不会在第一任总统任期结束后继续参选连任。
I was 14 then, old enough to understand how unusual it was for an incumbent African president to retire willingly.	当时我14岁，已经可以明白一位大权在握的非洲总统能自愿退休是件极不寻常的事。
In my own country, for example, people were beginning to wonder whether Moi would leave office in 2002, when his second term expired.	在我自己的国家肯尼亚，人们已经开始猜想莫伊总统究竟是否会在2002年第二任任期届满后退位。
He had ruled Kenya for 13 years before a move in 1991 to reintroduce multi-party democracy paved the way for an election the following year.	在1991年重新引入多党民主制并决定在1992年举行大选之前莫伊已经统治了肯尼亚14年。
Moi was allowed to run again, as long as he honored the constitutional two-term limit.	他被允许在新法令下重新参选，条件是要服从只可连任一届的宪法规定。
I feel extremely fortunate and honored that the start of my formal education coincided with Mandela’s re-emergence in African politics.	我的求学生涯恰好与曼德拉在非洲政治的重新崛起重合，对此我感到非常荣幸。
His patience, civility, and politics of reconciliation provided me a better example of democracy and good governance than any civics class could have done.	他的耐心，文雅以及和解政治都为我提供了一个民主和优秀治理和的绝佳范本，比所有公民教育都要更加生动和深刻。
Mandela embodied the type of leader that Africans had in mind when they struggled for freedom from the European empires.	曼德拉正是那些为摆脱欧洲帝国统治而抗争的非洲人心目中的领袖。
Africans wanted leaders who would reconcile and reunite them – leaders who would restore to them the dignity that colonialism had robbed.	他们希望有一个能促成各族和解并将所有人重新联合在一起的领袖 — — 一个能重新让他们找回被殖民主义夺去的自尊的人。
Unfortunately for many African countries, freedom and independence ended up in the hands of a few who had tasted and become addicted to the repressive practices that Africans had spent decades fighting.	但不幸的是，在许多非洲国家自由和独立依然是一纸空文。 自由终结在了某些曾经遭受，抗争，但却最终沉迷于残酷镇压手段的暴君手里。
They amassed untold wealth as hunger and disease ripped their societies apart and pushed more Africans deeper into poverty.	在他们聚敛巨额财富的同时饥饿与疾病却撕裂了非洲社会并将更多非洲人推向了贫穷的深渊。
Indeed, more than two decades after Mandela walked through the prison gates, supposedly completing Africa’s struggle for freedom, “Big Men” in countries like Congo and Zimbabwe continue to cling to power against the will of their people.	事实上，就在曼德拉走过罗本岛监狱大门，宣告非洲自由斗争胜利20年后的今天，科特迪瓦和津巴布韦等国的“强人”却继续罔顾人民的意愿，紧抱着权力不放。
Nevertheless, I am encouraged by the fact that, since Mandela left office, many African presidents – including Moi and Thabo Mbeki, Mandela’s successor – have adhered to their countries’ constitutions and left office without a fight.	但即便如此我还是保持乐观，因为许多非洲总统 — — 包括莫伊还有曼德莱的继任者姆贝基 — — 都能服从本国的宪法并平静地交出了权力。
I am also hopeful that Mandela has inspired other young people like me to continue Africa’s liberation peacefully – the Mandela way.	我也希望曼德拉能激励其他像我这样的青年人继续走上和平解放非洲的道路 — — 这就是曼德拉路线。
	
Jumpstarting Europe’s Economy	提振欧洲经济
PARIS – Not so long ago, the notion of the European Central Bank handing out money to governments or directly to citizens – so-called “helicopter money” drops – would have seemed outlandish.	巴黎—不久前，欧洲央行向政府或直接向公民派钱的概念 — — 即所谓的“直升机撒钱 ” — —看上去还荒诞不经。
But today a surprising number of mainstream economists and centrist politicians are endorsing the idea of monetary financing of stimulus measures in different forms.	但如今，令人意外地，大量主流经济学家和中间派政客支持不同形式的刺激计划货币融资的概念。
This represents a much-needed change in the conversation – one that, at long last, finally puts the focus squarely on stimulating the demand side of the European economy.	这表明话语出现了急需的改变 — — 重点终于对准了刺激欧洲经济的需求端。
After years of stagnant growth and debilitating unemployment, all options, no matter how unconventional, should be on the table.	在经历了多年的增长停滞和就业萎靡后，所有选项，不管它多么反常规，都应该摆上台面。
The United Kingdom’s referendum decision to leave the European Union only strengthens the case for more stimulus and unconventional measures in Europe.	英国全民公决决定脱离欧盟，这进一步加强了欧洲加码刺激和非常规措施的理由。
If a large majority of EU citizens is to support continued political integration, strong economic growth is critical.	要让绝大部分欧洲公民支持继续推进政治一体化，强劲的经济增长至关重要。
As research by McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) shows, despite bold quantitative easing and record low interest rates – the ECB was the first major central bank to introduce negative interest rates in 2014 – anemic demand continues to hobble GDP growth throughout Europe.	麦肯锡全球研究所（MGI）的研究表明，尽管采取了激进的量化宽松和创纪录的低利率 — — 欧洲央行在2014年率先在主要央行中引入了负利率 — — 但萎靡的需求仍然拖累着整个欧洲的GDP增长。
In several EU countries, more than a quarter of the population has been unemployed for close to a decade, and political discontent is boiling over into extremism.	在一些欧盟国家，超过四分之一人口已经接近十年找不到工作，政治不满也日益走向极端。
The uncertainty and volatility in financial markets in the aftermath of the Brexit vote will further cripple demand.	金融市场在英国退出投票后的不确定性和波动将进步一制约需求。
The wave of corporate investment that was supposed to be unleashed by a combination of fiscal restraint (to rein in government debt) and monetary easing (to generate ultra-low interest rates) has never materialized.	财政约束（遏制政府债务）和货币宽松（形成极低利率）的组合理应带来公司投资潮，但这一幕并未发生。
Instead, European companies slashed annual investment by more than €100 billion ($113 billion) a year from 2008 to 2015, and have stockpiled some €700 billion of cash on their balance sheets.	相反，2008—2015年间欧洲公司的年投资规模减少了1,000亿欧元以上，而在资产负债表上囤积了大约7,000亿欧元现金。
This is not surprising – businesses invest when they are confident about future demand and output growth.	这并不令人奇怪 — — 企业在它们对未来需求和产出增长充满信心时投资。
Even before the Brexit vote, European and other global companies were not confident in Europe’s prospects.	即使在英国退出投票前，欧洲和其他全球公司对欧洲的前景也不抱信心。
Now they are confronting elevated risks of a European recession and the real possibility that both the UK and the EU could break up if populist contagion takes hold.	如今，它们面临着欧洲衰退风险升级和民粹主义蔓延导致英国和欧盟解体的实实在在的可能性。
Business investors hate uncertainty and the Brexit vote has created a dramatically more uncertain world in Europe and beyond.	商业投资者厌恶不确定性，而英国退出在欧洲内外造成了巨大的新增不确定性。
Fiscal austerity and ultra-low interest rates have also proven ineffective at stimulating household demand – and they may be backfiring.	财政紧缩和极低利率也没能有效刺激家庭需求 — — 并且可能适得其反。
When individuals cannot find decent yields, they may actually increase their savings to achieve their retirement goals.	当个人无法获得体面的收益率时，他们实际可能增加储蓄以实现退休目标。
And in the typical European city, where land and affordable housing are in short supply, lower interest rates have been driving property prices higher rather than stimulating construction.	而在典型的欧洲城市，土地和平价房产供给短缺，降低利率进一步推高了房价，而不是刺激了建筑业。
It’s well past time to acknowledge the limits of current policy.	承认当前政策的局限性良机已过。
Under today’s precarious conditions, demand could certainly be better supported through strategies other than quantitative easing and ultra-low interest rates.	在眼下的危险情况中，需求显然更应该通过战略而不是量化宽松和极低利率来支持。
Moreover, alternative approaches to stimulate private demand might have fewer undesirable distributional consequences, as MGI has discussed.	此外，如MGI所讨论的，刺激私人需求的其他方法可能产生更少的不良分配后果。
Proponents of helicopter money – directly crediting citizens with central bank funds, or crediting national treasuries to finance infrastructure and other demand-generating activities – rightly argue that it has the advantage of putting money directly into the hands of those who will spend it.	直升机撒钱 — — 直接用央行资金授信给公民，或授信国家财政机关为基础设施和其他产生需求的活动融资 — — 的支持者正确地指出，它具有将钱直接送到会花钱的人手里的优点。
An appropriately sized helicopter-money program might also raise inflation in a measured way, heading off the possibility of a Japanese-style deflationary trap.	规模合理的直升机撒钱计划还可以可控地提高通胀，避免日本式通缩陷阱的风险。
Indeed, the boost to demand might give central banks the opening they need to move interest rates back toward historical norms.	事实上，需求提振可能让央行获得让利率回归历史正常水平所需要的机会。
This could take the air out of incipient assets bubbles that might be forming and ease pressures on institutional investors who are struggling to find the yield they need to meet their insurance and pension commitments.	这可以扼杀萌芽之中的资产泡沫，缓解苦苦寻觅满足保险和退休金要求的收益率的机构投资者的压力。
But a helicopter-money program – a fanciful idea when Milton Friedman proposed it in 1969 – would also be a radical departure for policymakers, requiring an abundance of caution about citizen and investor perception, confidence, and solid governance structures.	但直升机撒钱计划 — — 这一金融概念由弗里德曼（Milton Friedman）于1969年提出 — — 也将是决策者的一次严重的离经叛道，需要公民和投资者认知有充分的谨慎、信心和可靠的治理结构。
And such an approach would cement the notion that central bank policy is “the only game in town,” relieving elected government leaders of their responsibility for pro-growth policies and the fiscal decisions they control.	这一方针将巩固央行政策是“唯一的游戏”的概念，让民选政府摆脱促增长政策的责任，解除它们的财政决定控制权。
A less risky and time-tested route for stimulating demand would be a significant increase in public infrastructure investment funded by government debt.	一个风险较小、经历时间考验的刺激需求的方法是大幅增加政府债务融资的公共基础设施投资。
It is well documented that Europe and the United States have underinvested in infrastructure.	大量证据表明欧洲和美国基础设施投资不足。
From a macroeconomic perspective, infrastructure investment is a “twofer”– it strengthens productivity and competitiveness in the long run and, where there is unused capacity, it boosts demand, output, and employment with significant multiplier effects in the short run.	从宏观经济角度，基础设施是“买一送一 ” ： 它增强长期生产率和竞争力，同时，在存在产能过剩的地方，它以显著的短期乘数效应刺激需求、产出和就业。
Yet governments across Europe have clamped down on infrastructure spending for years, giving precedence to fiscal austerity and debt reduction in the misguided belief that government borrowing crowds out private investment and reduces growth.	但整个欧洲的政府多年来都在遏制基础设施支出，在政府借贷挤出私人投资、降低增长的误导信念下，财政紧缩和减少债务才是重点。
But the crowding-out logic applies only to conditions of full employment, conditions that clearly do not exist in most of Europe today.	但挤出逻辑只有在充分就业条件下才成立，而当今欧洲的大部分国家显然不是这样。
In addition, infrastructure investment cannot be deferred forever.	此外，基础设施投资不可能永远推迟。
A new reckoning is warranted, one that accounts for the full costs of underinvestment in terms of foregone employment and growth.	新的算计迟早会降临，考虑就业和增长损失等投资不足的全面成本。
One way to break the stalemate is a change in public accounting standards.	打破僵局的一个办法是改变公共会计准则。
Specifically, if governments were able to treat infrastructure investment just as companies treat capital expenditure – as balance-sheet assets that are depreciated over their lifecycle, rather than as one-off expenses – such investment could then be exempted from Europe’s deficit rules without opening the door to profligate spending or easing the pressure for credible plans for long-term fiscal-consolidation.	具体而言，如果政府可以如公司处理资本支出一样将基础设施投资 — — 作为资产负债表中的资产，按生命周期折旧，而不是一次性支出 — — 这些投资就可以免受欧洲财政规则约束，并且不会开启挥霍性支出的大门或缓解可信长期财政整合计划的压力。
Of course, it would be crucial to improve the planning and oversight of infrastructure projects simultaneously, as MGI has argued.	当然，如MGI所指出的，同时改善基础设施项目的规划和监督至关重要。
Fresh thinking about structural reform is needed, too.	关于结构改革的新鲜思维也必不可少。
For decades, reform discussions in the EU have focused on reducing labor-market regulation, cutting red tape in product markets, privatizing state-owned enterprises, and lowering tax rates.	几十年来，欧盟改革讨论一直聚焦于减少劳动力市场监管、消除产品市场的官样文章、国有企业私有化以及降低税率。
But reform should now work with the grain of efforts to bolster demand – for example, unleashing the silver economy, fostering digital education and innovation, and unlocking urban land markets to pave the way for much-needed investment in housing.	但如今，改革必须与辅之以刺激需求的措施 — — 比如解放银色经济、促进数字教育和创新、解放城市土地市场为急需的房地产投资扫清障碍等。
Each of these options would require robust debate and deeper investigation.	这些选择的每一项都要求进行热烈的讨论和深层次的调查。
But it’s clear that Europe needs a larger set of policy options.	但显然，欧洲需要更大规模的政策选择范围。
Quantitative easing and ultra-low interest rates should no longer be the only arrows in the macroeconomic policy quiver.	量化宽松和极低利率不应该继续成为仅有的宏观经济政策工具。
These tools, along with excessive fiscal austerity, may have higher costs in terms of foregone employment and growth – and rising political discontent – than “risky” alternative options.	它们与财政过度紧缩的结合所造成的代价 — — 以失去的就业和增长以及不断加剧的政治不满衡量 — — 可能比“高风险”替代选择更大。
The Brexit vote is a canary in the coal mine for Europe’s economic policy makers.	对欧洲经济政策决策者而言，英国退出投票好比是煤矿里的金丝雀。
Unconventional times require consideration of bold unconventional policy approaches.	非常规时期需要考虑激进的非常规政策方针。
	
Jean-Claude Juncker’s Roadmap for European Disaster	容克的欧洲灾难路线图
MUNICH – A group of hikers has lost its way.	慕尼黑—一群徒步旅行者迷了路。
They want to get to a castle on a hill in the distance, but the path they are on seems to be leading in a different direction, and their leader’s only advice is to hurry up.	他们想去远处山上的城堡，但脚下的道路似乎方向错了，而领头人还在不断催他们快走。
Today, the eurozone is in the same situation as those hikers.	今天的欧元区的状况就像是这样一群徒步旅行者。
It has become increasingly clear that establishing the euro was the wrong path to take.	情况越来越清楚，引入欧元是一步错棋。
The single currency caused an inflationary credit bubble in Southern Europe.	单一货币导致南欧出现通胀性信用泡沫。
When the bubble burst, the region’s competitiveness was destroyed, and Northern Europe was called on to provide huge loan guarantees, public credit, and transfers.	泡沫破裂时，该地区的竞争力也随之毁灭，而北欧被要求提供巨额贷款担保、公共信用和转移支付。
These measures have sustained the wrong relative prices that resulted from the bubble, and papered over the underlying problem.	这些措施维持了错误的相对价格 — — 这是这种错误的相对价格引起了泡沫 — — 也掩盖了根本问题。
Meanwhile, the Schengen Agreement, which eliminated most border checks between European Union member states, has facilitated the ability of immigrants from the poorer parts of Asia and Africa to flock to Northern European welfare states in recent years.	与此同时，申根协定取消了大部分欧盟成员国之间的边检，便利了移民在近几年中从较穷的亚洲和非洲大量涌向北欧福利国家。
In response to these events, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker used his State of the Union address this month to call for even more countries to join the eurozone and the Schengen Area.	应对这些情况，欧盟委员会主席容克在本月的欧盟盟情咨文中号召更多国家加入欧元区和申根区。
Juncker is the charismatic but confused guide who is leading our metaphorical group of hikers astray.	容克是一个很有魅力但头脑混乱的向导，正在引导我们这个隐喻中的徒步旅行团迷路。
All non-euro EU member states, except Denmark are already legally obligated to work toward adopting the euro, by satisfying various “convergence criteria.”	所有非欧元欧盟成员国（除了丹麦 ） ， 都有法定义务致力于通过满足不同的“趋同标准 ” ， 逐步采用欧元。
But Juncker obviously wants to accelerate that process, by loosening the eurozone membership criteria and providing financial incentives for new members to join.	但容克显然希望加速这一进程，放松欧元区成员资格标准，并提供金融激励刺激新成员加入。
Given the eurozone’s past problems, this is an extremely dangerous proposition.	考虑到欧元区过去的问题，这一方案非常危险。
If realized, it would probably fuel the same kind of destructive overheating that we have seen in Southern Europe.	如果实现的话，它有可能助推南欧所出现过的破坏性过热。
In fact, Bulgarian, Croatian, and Romanian households have already loaded up on excessive debt in foreign currencies – primarily euros – in anticipation of joining the monetary union, and this has created substantial financial difficulties.	事实上，在预期加入欧洲货币联盟的情况下，保加利亚、克罗地亚和罗马尼亚家庭已经外币债台高筑 — — 主要是欧元债务 — — 而这带来了巨大的金融困难。
Of course, it is understandable that Western banks that recklessly extended euro loans to these countries now want to give them euro printing presses.	当然，不难理解，鲁莽地想这些国家大肆发放欧元贷款的西方银行现在想把欧元印钞机也送给它们。
That way, the debtor countries can reassure their creditors and repay their loans with self-printed cash if necessary, as Southern European countries have done for the last decade.	如此，债务国就可以保证在必要时用自己印的现金来偿还它们的贷款，就像南欧国家在过去十年中所做的那样。
Providing Bulgaria, Croatia, and Romania with national euro printing presses would keep private credit flowing and enable foreign-currency loans to be rolled over.	向保加利亚、克罗地亚和罗马尼亚提供国家欧元印钞权将维持私人信用流，使外币贷款得以延期。
But so much artificially cheap credit would also bloat state pensions, government wages, and social transfers.	但人为的廉价信用也将导致国家退休金、政府工资和社会转移支付膨胀。
And this, in turn, would lead to overheating real-estate markets and domestic-wage increases, thus undermining international competitiveness.	而这反过来又将导致房地产市场过热和国内工资上涨，从而破坏国际竞争力。
Normally, a country that finds itself in such a position would urgently devalue its currency.	通常，陷入这一状况的国家要采取紧急货币贬值。
But, because euro membership precludes that option, financially sound Northern European countries would once again be called upon to help with European Central Bank loan guarantees and financial transfers, while tolerating the newly added eurozone members’ self-service with the printing press.	但欧元区成员国身份排除了这一选项，因此金融坚挺的北欧国家将再次被要求帮助欧洲央行贷款担保和金融转移支付，同时容忍新加入的欧元区成员国开动印钞机满足自我的做法。
In short, Juncker’s plan to accelerate eurozone accession threatens to recreate in spades the chaos of the past decade, which started with a bubble in Southern Europe, and culminated in the Greek sovereign-debt crisis.	简言之，容克的计划 — — 加快欧元区加入流程 — — 有可能让过去十年的混乱重演，上一次混乱始于南欧的泡沫，在希腊主权债务危机中达到高潮。
Juncker’s proposal to extend the Schengen Area to the east is similarly misguided, and seems to ignore the lessons of recent history.	容克的申根区东扩方案也有同样的误导作用，并且无视最新的历史教训。
The unmanageable wave of immigration in 2015 showed that Europe has too few internal and external border controls.	2015年面临难民潮束手无策的情况表明，欧洲内部和外部的边境控制太少了。
Juncker might like to think that immigration has since slowed, owing to the agreement that the EU reached with Turkey in early 2016.	容克也许在想，因为欧盟与土耳其在2016年年初达成了协议，此后移民流入速度有所放缓。
But data from the European border-control authority Frontex indicate that the migration flows stalled once a fence was erected in Macedonia, at the behest of Austria and the Visegrád countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia).	但欧盟边防局（Frontex）的数据显示，移民流系在奥地利和维谢格拉德国家（捷克、匈牙利、波兰和斯洛伐克）要求马其顿建立了隔离墙后才应声下降。
Moreover, the Hungarian-Serbian border fence and Hungary’s ever-tightening controls at its border with Romania have also contributed to European stability.	此外，匈牙利-塞尔维亚边境墙和匈牙利日益收紧的罗马尼亚边境控制也有助于欧洲的稳定。
But migrants are now crossing the Black Sea from Turkey to Bulgaria, and might come in even larger numbers if the EU membership negotiations with Turkey stall.	但现在移民从土耳其穿越黑海进入保加利亚，如果土耳其欧盟成员资格谈判陷入停顿，移民的数量可能会变得更加巨大。
As a result, the rest of the EU should oppose any bid to eliminate existing border controls, which is exactly what would happen if Bulgaria and Romania were included in the Schengen Area.	因此，其他欧盟成员国应该反对一切取消现有边控措施的提案，而如果保加利亚和罗马尼亚被纳入申根区，这一幕必将成为现实。
One can only wonder what is driving Juncker’s proposals.	不禁要问，是什么推动容克提出这样的提案。
To be sure, the European Commission cannot neglect the interests of financial institutions in Paris, Luxembourg, and Frankfurt.	平心而论，欧盟委员会不可能无视巴黎、卢森堡和法兰克福的金融机构的利益。
No one wants the ill-advised loans extended to Eastern European countries to fuel another bank crisis.	没人希望让不审慎的贷款扩大到东欧国家，助长又一场银行危机。
But the result of Juncker having his way would be even worse.	但容克取得成功的结果将更加糟糕。
An inflationary bubble in Eastern Europe, coupled with the dismantling of border controls, could destabilize the entire EU and create a fresh wave of economic migrants into Central Europe.	东欧的通胀性泡沫，加上边控的取消，可能动摇整个欧盟，导致新一波经济移民潮进入中欧。
It is time for Europe’s trail guide to see reason, consult a compass, and get back on track.	欧洲的徒步旅行向导应该讲讲道理，看看罗盘，认清正确的道路。
	
Europe’s Trade Victory in Washington	欧洲在华盛顿的贸易胜利
WASHINGTON, DC – On July 25, when US President Donald Trump appeared in front of the White House with Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, their joint statement and spoken remarks surprised many.	华盛顿—7月25日，美国总统与欧盟委员会主席容克一起出现在白宫前时，他们的联合声明和言辞震惊了很多人。
The two sides agreed “to work together toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods.”	双方同意 “共同致力于零关税、令非关税壁垒、零非汽车工业产品补贴 ” 。
It seemed like a remarkable U-turn for Trump, who, until recently, was threatening the European Union with higher tariffs – and extolling the value of trade tariffs (which are essentially taxes on imported goods) more generally.	这对特朗普来说简直是一百八十度的大转弯，在此之前，特朗普一直威胁要对欧盟采取更高的关税 — — 还赞美关税的价值（本质上，关税就是对进口商品征税 ） 。
He even called the EU a “foe” as recently as June.	在6月份，他还把欧盟称为 “敌人 ” 。
Substantive follow-through on the joint US-EU statement would represent a major policy shift for the Trump administration.	美国-欧盟联合声明后的真正的后续动作将代表特朗普政府的重大政策转向。
But this is no triumph for Trump; rather, he seems to have been outmaneuvered by adroit European diplomats.	但这并不是特朗普的胜利，相反，他似乎被欧洲外交官所智胜。
It is always hard to know when Trump has actually changed a policy – or when he may change it again.	要弄清楚特朗普何时真正改变政策 — — 或者他何时再次改变 — — 向来很难。
Still, it is worth noting that what Trump and Juncker announced was essentially a pledge to work toward exactly the kind of trade agreement that the Obama administration was negotiating with the Europeans from 2013 through the end of 2016.	尽管如此，值得注意，特朗普和容克所宣布的歧视是一项承诺：共同致力于奥巴马政府从2013年开始与欧洲谈判、一直谈到2016年的贸易协定。
Work on that earlier version, known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), was suspended following Trump’s inauguration.	此前的版本，即跨大西洋贸易和投资伙伴关系（TTIP ） ， 在特朗普上台后戛然而止。
Restarting the TTIP negotiation is a big win for Juncker, in line with long-standing European objectives.	重启TTIP谈判对容克来说是一场大胜，符合欧洲的长期目标。
It would also make it much harder for Trump to impose tariffs on European car imports – and German car companies’ stock prices rose sharply on the news.	这也使特朗普更加难以对欧洲汽车进口征收关税 — — 德国汽车公司股价也应声飙涨。
It is also remarkable that Juncker managed to get Trump to emphasize working with the World Trade Organization to resolve issues regarding intellectual property rights.	还值得关注的是，容克成功地让特朗普强调与世贸组织合作解决知识产权权利相关的问题。
Cecilia Malmström, the EU trade commissioner, has been stressing exactly this approach.	欧盟贸易委员塞西莉亚·马尔姆斯特伦（Cecilia Malmström）一直在强调这一方针。
What did Trump get from the Europeans, other than a return to a trade negotiation straight out of the Obama era?	除了回归完全出自奥巴马时代的贸易谈判，特朗普还从欧洲得到了什么？
Trump claimed, at the press conference and subsequently, that he won a pledge from Juncker to buy more natural gas and “a lot of soybeans.”	特朗普在记者招待会和随后宣称，他获得容克的承诺，要购买更多的天然气和“大量大豆 ” 。
Some media coverage even suggested that the Europeans had made concessions.	一些媒体报道甚至表示，欧洲人做出了让步。
But that interpretation does not fit the facts.	但这一解读不符合事实。
Regarding potential US exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe, the Europeans have long been keen to increase this trade.	在美国对欧洲的潜在液化天然气（LNG）出口问题上，欧洲人一直渴望促进这项贸易。
The hold-up is US restrictions on energy exports.	障碍出在美国对能源出口的限制上。
If there is any concession promised by the joint statement, it is from the Trump administration on this issue.	如果说联合声明中有什么让步的话，那也是特朗普政府在这个问题上做出了让步。
This was made explicit in the fact sheet that the White House subsequently issued: “the United States will make it easier for the EU to purchase liquefied natural gas.”	白宫随后发布的情况说明证实了这一点 ： “ 美国将让欧盟更加方便地采购液化天然气 。 ”
At the same time, Juncker does not buy soybeans – the European Commission has no such budget, and any such imports would ultimately be a private-sector decision.	与此同时，容克也没有买大豆 — — 欧盟没有这一预算，一切大豆进口交易说到底都是私人部门的决定。
The price of soybeans has fallen sharply in recent months, owing to China’s imposition of tariffs on US soybeans, in retaliation to higher US tariffs on some Chinese exports.	最近几个月中，由于中国出于对美国提高一些中国出口产品的关税而对美国大豆征收关税，大豆价格急剧下跌。
The price of US soybeans has fallen significantly more than has the price of Brazilian soybeans, as Brazil is not subject to the new Chinese tariff.	美国大豆的价格跌幅比巴西大豆还要大，因为巴西不受中国新关税政策影响。
Given this, it makes sense that the European private sector will buy more US soybeans, regardless of what Juncker says or does.	因此，欧洲私人部门购买更多美国大豆是理性决定，不管容克说了或做了什么。
US soybeans are already sold tariff-free in Europe, and, because China accounts for one-third of all US soybeans exports, there is plenty of product available.	美国大豆已经在欧洲实现免关税，而由于中国占了美国大豆出口量的三分之一，美国对欧大豆出口货源充足。
But there was no European concession at the White House on this issue – just a clever restatement of market realities.	但在这个问题上，不存在欧洲对白宫的让步 — — 它只是对市场现实的明智声明。
Furthermore, Europeans’ purchases of soybeans are less than a quarter of China’s.	此外，欧洲的大豆采购量还不到中国的四分之一。
The soybean pledge has some superficial political appeal, as growers have found themselves caught in the crossfire of Trump’s trade war with China.	大豆承诺具有一些付钱的政治号召力，因为大豆种植者发现自己成了特朗普的对华贸易战的箭头。
The cost is real, and the Trump administration recently promised up to $12 billion to help affected agribusinesses.	代价是实实在在的，特朗普政府最近也承诺拨款120美元帮助受影响的农业企业。
However, this entire potential cost is due to the Trump administration’s disruptive policies and represents a scandalous waste of taxpayer money – an amount equal to about one-third of the entire annual budget of the US National Institutes of Health.	但是，全部潜在成本都要归因于特朗普政府的破坏性政策，也是对纳税人资金的可耻浪费 — — 其规模相当于美国国家卫生研究院（National Institutes of Health）年度总预算的三分之一。
How many lives could be saved through the judicious use of that $12 billion for, say, public health programs?	如果能够合理地将这120亿美元应用于（比如）公共卫生计划的话，能够拯救多少生命？
Meanwhile, the federal government’s budget deficit continues to increase – creating pressures for destructive future austerity.	与此同时，联邦政府的预算赤字在继续增加 — — 这造成了未来破坏性紧缩的压力。
Trump holds himself out as a brilliant negotiator, and his supporters regard his trade policy as a perfect example of his success.	特朗普自视为出色的谈判家，他的支持者把他的贸易政策看成是他的成功的完美范例。
But in his recent talks with the Europeans, Trump was clearly out of his depth.	但在最近与欧洲的谈判中，特朗普显然尽落下风。
	
Europe’s Trade Coup	欧洲的贸易妙计
BRUSSELS – All has gone quiet on the transatlantic trade front, with last month’s agreement between US President Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker having dispelled fears of an all-out tariff war.	布鲁塞尔—跨大西洋贸易阵线上，一切静悄悄，上个月美国总统特朗普和欧盟委员会主席容克之间达成的协议打消了全方位关税战的担忧。
The deal was surprising, but perhaps it shouldn’t have been.	该协议是一个惊喜，但也许并不应该如此。
At the core of the agreement concluded by Juncker and Trump was the understanding that the European Union and the United States will “work together toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods,” with no new trade barriers in the meantime.	容克和特朗普所达成的协议的核心是欧盟和美国将“共同致力于非汽车工业产品零关税，零非关税壁垒和零补贴 ” ， 并不再制造新的贸易壁垒。
But the potential for a free-trade agreement isn’t the point; what matters is the end to the escalation of tit-for-tat measures, set in motion by Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on US imports of European steel.	但自由贸易协定的潜力不在于此；重要的是因特朗普对美国进口品和欧洲钢铁征收关税的决定而引起的以牙还牙式升级的结束。
The US president has the power to impose tariffs and other trade barriers unilaterally, in the interest of national security.	美国总统 有权单方面采取关税和其他贸易壁垒，只要符合国家利益。
That is why Trump has been able to launch his own personal trade war, without so much as consulting the US Congress.	因此，特朗普能够发动自己的个人贸易战，而不必过多咨询美国国会。
A full-scale trade agreement, however, would need congressional approval.	但全方位贸易协定需要国会批准。
Given the myriad special interests that such a deal would mobilize, it is highly unlikely that any trade agreement – even one limited to industrial products – will materialize any time soon.	这样一个协议会牵扯到各种特殊利益集团，因此，在较短时期内，任何贸易协定都基本无法落实 — — 哪怕其范围只限于工业产品。
Historically, the US has been able to conclude trade agreements only when a coalition of actors that would benefit from better export opportunities secured more votes than those who were vulnerable to import competition.	历史上，美国只有在多方行为人都能够从更好的出口条件中获益，从而确保能够获得比不愿看到进口竞争的人更多的选票的情况下，才能达成贸易协定。
When trade is considered an economic issue, it is usually possible to assemble such a coalition, because the benefits of trade liberalization outweigh the costs.	当贸易被作为一个经济问题考虑时，就很容易形成多方获益联盟，因为贸易自由化的收益会大于成本。
But this has often proved more difficult in the US than elsewhere, because trade plays a relatively small role in the US economy.	但这在美国往往比其他国家更难，因为贸易在美国经济中所扮演的角色相对较小。
Goods exports may be Trump’s main focus, but the reality is that they account for less than 10% of GDP.	商品出口可能是特朗普的主要关注点，但现实是它们只占GDP的不到10 % 。
Direct employment in exporting industries does not play a significant role in the US labor market.	出口行业的直接就业对于美国劳动力市场也无关紧要。
In Europe, by contrast, exports account for more than 25% of GDP in most countries; in Germany, the figure exceeds 50%.	相反，欧洲大部分国家，出口占了GDP的25%以上；德国更是占了50%以上。
When an economy is so dependent on trade, it becomes much easier to make the case for liberalization, which is why Europe has long been more enthusiastic than the US about a transatlantic free-trade agreement.	当一个经济体如此依赖贸易时，就会更容易接受自由化，正因如此，欧洲向来比美国更热衷于跨大西洋自由贸易协定。
Negotiations for such an agreement – the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership – stalled during President Barack Obama’s administration.	关于这样一个协定 — — 跨大西洋贸易和投资伙伴协定（TTIP ） — —的谈判在奥巴马总统执政期间陷入了停滞。
Beyond the deal itself, Juncker apparently made a personal promise that the EU would buy more US agricultural products.	除了协议本身，容克显然还做出了一项个人承诺：欧盟将购买更多的美国农产品。
This pledge is both empty and easy to fulfill.	这项承诺很空洞，也很容易实现。
It is empty, because the European Commission has no budget to buy US soybeans or any means to impel EU consumers to do so.	说它空洞，是因为欧盟委员会没有预算购买美国大豆或采取任何手段迫使欧盟消费者这样做。
It is easy to fulfill, because China has already imposed tariffs on US soybeans in retaliation for US tariffs on its exports, meaning that non-US soybean producers are now likely to shift their exports to the Chinese market, freeing up the EU market for US producers.	说它容易实现，是因为美国已对美国大豆征收关税，以作为美国对中国出口品征收关税的报复措施，这意味着非美国大豆种植户现在可以将转而对中国出口，释放出美国种植户的欧洲市场。
The main impact of Chinese tariffs on US soybeans will thus be the redirection of global soybean flows.	因此，中国对美国大豆征收关税的主要影响是改变了全球大豆流向。
But China’s role extends beyond soybeans.	但中国的角色不仅限于大豆。
In fact, it is the trade dynamics with China that explain Trump’s willingness to reach an agreement with Juncker in the first place.	事实上，对华贸易动态可以解释特朗普为何愿意与容克达成协议。
A tariff on imports to the US has a much greater impact if Chinese exporters are the only ones to encounter it.	对美国进口商品征收关税只针对中国出口商，那么其影响将大得多。
A 25% duty on, say, aircraft engines from China would allow manufacturers elsewhere to gain market share, whereas if everyone had to pay the same tariff, the playing field would be unchanged.	比如，对来自中国的飞机发动机征收25%关税能够让世界其他国家的制造商赢得市场份额，而如果所有人都要付同样的关税，那么竞争环境并未改变。
Ensuring that the EU does not face the same tariffs as China is particularly significant, because European suppliers are Chinese exporters’ main competitors in many industries.	确保欧盟不会面临与中国一样的关税意义尤其重大，因为欧盟供应商是中国出口商在许多行业内的主要竞争对手。
Given that the EU also competes with the US in the Chinese market, European industry might actually gain (marginally) from a Sino-American trade war.	由于欧盟也需要和美国在中国市场上竞争，欧洲工业可能真能从中美贸易战中获取（边际）利益。
So long as the US and China are battling it out on trade, the transatlantic truce represents a coup for Europe.	只要美国和中国在贸易问题上斗争，跨大西洋休战就是欧洲的妙计。
The truce is not nearly as good for China.	休战对中国来说没有这么有用。
While the country’s leaders have continued to pay lip service to free trade, they have so far proved unwilling to take into account the grievances of both the US and Europe.	中国领导人虽然口头上继续支持自由贸易，但到目前为止，他们并不愿意考虑美国和欧洲的怨气。
If China wants allies in its trade war with the US, it will have to revise many domestic regulations and practices that constitute de facto discrimination against foreign competitors.	如果中国想要在与美国的贸易战中找到盟友，就必须大量修改构成针对外国竞争者的事实歧视的国内监管和做法。
Thus, the EU-US deal has brought to the fore the real question China’s leaders face: whether to maintain strong government support for domestic industry.	因此，欧盟-美国协议将中国领导人面临的真正问题摆上了台面：是否保持政府对国内产业的强力支持。
While protectionist measures might have been defensible 20 years ago, China’s economy is far more competitive today.	20年前，保护主义措施也许还有辩护的余地，但今天的中国竞争力早已非昨日可比。
Whatever benefit China derives from such measures may well be outweighed by an escalating trade war– especially now that the EU is safe and China will have to face the US alone.	中国从这些措施中所得到的好处，很有可能大大低于贸易战升级所造成的损失 — — 特别是在欧盟已经安全，而中国需要独自面对美国的时候。
	
How Much Europe Can Europe Tolerate?	欧洲可以容忍多少欧洲？
CAMBRIDGE – This month the European Union will celebrate the 60th anniversary of its founding treaty, the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community.	坎布里奇—本月，欧盟将迎来其创始条约 — — 罗马条约签订60周年。 罗马条约建立了欧洲经济共同体。
There certainly is much to celebrate.	当然，值得庆祝的方面很多。
After centuries of war, upheaval, and mass killings, Europe is peaceful and democratic.	在经历了几个世纪的战争、动荡和大屠杀后，欧洲进入了和平与民主的时期。
The EU has brought 11 former Soviet-bloc countries into its fold, successfully guiding their post-communist transitions.	欧盟将11个前苏联国家纳入它的阵营，成功地指引了它们的后共产主义转型。
And, in an age of inequality, EU member countries exhibit the lowest income gaps anywhere in the world.	而在不平等性的时代，欧盟成员国的收入差距是全世界最小的。
But these are past achievements.	但这些都是过去的成就。
Today, the Union is mired in a deep existential crisis, and its future is very much in doubt.	如今，欧盟陷入了深刻的生存危机，其未来也颇可怀疑。
The symptoms are everywhere: Brexit, crushing levels of youth unemployment in Greece and Spain, debt and stagnation in Italy, the rise of populist movements, and a backlash against immigrants and the euro.	症候随处可见：英国退欧、希腊和西班牙畸高的年轻人失业率、意大利的债务和停滞、民粹主义运动兴起，还有对移民和欧元的攻讦。
They all point to the need for a major overhaul of Europe’s institutions.	所有这些都表明，欧洲的制度需要一场大修。
So a new white paper on the future of Europe by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker comes none too soon.	因此，欧盟委员会主席容克新发布的欧洲未来白皮书可谓正逢其时。
Juncker sets out five possible paths: carrying on with the current agenda, focusing just on the single market, allowing some countries to move faster than others toward integration, narrowing down the agenda, and pushing ambitiously for uniform and more complete integration.	容克提出了五条可能的道路：坚持当前日程；只关注单一市场；允许其中一些国家比其他国家更快地走向一体化；精简日程；以及坚定推进统一和更全面的一体化。
It’s hard not to feel sympathy for Juncker.	你很难不与容克感同身受。
With Europe’s politicians preoccupied with their domestic battles and the EU institutions in Brussels a target for popular frustration, he could stick his neck out only so far.	欧洲政客被国内斗争缠住，难以分心，布鲁斯尔的欧盟机构成为群众失望的针对目标，因此，他只能昂首坚持到这一步。
Still, his report is disappointing.	尽管如此，他的报告仍然令人失望。
It sidesteps the central challenge that the EU must confront and overcome.	它回避了欧盟必须面临和克服的核心挑战。
If European democracies are to regain their health, economic and political integration cannot remain out of sync.	欧洲民主国家想要恢复健康，就必须同步进行经济和政治一体化。
Either political integration catches up with economic integration, or economic integration needs to be scaled back.	要么政治一体化赶上经济一体化，要么经济一体化退步匹配政治一体化。
As long as this decision is evaded, the EU will remain dysfunctional.	这个决定一天不做出，欧盟就会保持一天混乱。
When confronted with this stark choice, member states are likely to end up in different positions along the continuum of economic-political integration.	面临如此艰难的选择，欧盟成员国可能根据各自在政治-经济一体化连续统（continuum）中所处的位置而采取不同的立场。
This implies that Europe must develop the flexibility and institutional arrangements to accommodate them.	这意味着欧洲必须形成灵活性和制度安排来协调它们。
From the very beginning, Europe was built on a “functionalist” argument: political integration would follow economic integration.	从一开始，欧洲就建立在“功能论”的基础上：先经济一体化，再政治一体化。
Juncker’s white paper opens appropriately with a 1950 quote from the European Economic Community founder (and French prime minister) Robert Schuman: “Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan.	容克的白皮书在一开始恰如其分地引用了1950年欧洲共同体创始人（兼法国总理）罗伯特·舒曼（Robert Schuman）的话 ： “ 欧洲不是一天建成的，也不是根据一个计划建成的。
It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity.”	它需要经过扎实的成就简称，首先就是要建立事实上的凝聚力 。 ”
Build the mechanisms of economic cooperation first, and this will prepare the ground for common political institutions.	先建立经济合作机制，从而为共同政治机构打好基础。
This approach worked fine at first.	一开始，这一方针效果显著。
It enabled economic integration to remain one step ahead of political integration – but not too far ahead.	它让经济一体化一直领先政治一体化一步，而又不至于过于领先。
Then, after the 1980s, the EU took a leap into the unknown.	接着，到了20世纪80年代后，欧盟跃入了未知领域。
It adopted an ambitious single-market agenda that aimed to unify Europe’s economies, whittling away at national policies that hampered the free movement not just of goods, but also of services, people, and capital. The euro, which established a single currency among a subset of member states, was the logical extension of this agenda.	它采取了一个雄心勃勃的单一市场日程，旨在统一欧洲各经济体，削平阻碍不仅仅是商品、也包括服务、人力和资本的自由流动的国家政策，于是，由部分成员国组成的共同货币区作为这一日程的应有之义而应运而生。
This was hyper-globalization on a European scale.	这就是欧洲规模上的超全球化。
The new agenda was driven by a confluence of factors.	新日程受多种因素合力的推动。
Many economists and technocrats thought Europe’s governments had become too interventionist and that deep economic integration and a single currency would discipline the state.	许多经济学家和技术官僚认为欧洲各国政府过于干预主义，深刻的经济一体化和单一货币能在纪律上约束国家。
From this perspective, the imbalance between the economic and political legs of the integration process was a feature, not a bug.	从这个角度出发，经济和政治一体化进程的失衡是一个特征，而不是一个缺陷。
Many politicians, however, recognized that the imbalance was potentially problematic.	但是，许多政客认为这一失衡可能大有问题。
But they assumed functionalism would eventually come to the rescue: the quasi-federal political institutions needed to underpin the single market would develop, given sufficient time.	但他们认为功能论最终能够力挽狂澜：只要时间足够，单一市场所需要的准联邦政治制度基础是可以发展出来的。
The leading European powers played their part.	欧洲领导力量起到了作用。
The French thought that shifting economic authority to bureaucrats in Brussels would enhance French national power and global prestige.	法国认为将经济大权让渡给布鲁塞尔的官僚能加强法国的国家实力和全球地位。
The Germans, eager to gain France’s agreement to German reunification, went along.	德国渴望法国首肯其重新统一，对法国亦步亦趋。
There was an alternative.	也曾有过其他道路。
Europe could have allowed a common social model to develop alongside economic integration.	欧洲原本可以让随着经济一体化发展一个共同社会模式。
This would have required integrating not only markets but also social policies, labor-market institutions, and fiscal arrangements.	这不但需要市场的一体化，还需要社会政策、劳动力市场制度和财政安排的一体化。
The diversity of social models across Europe, and the difficulty of reaching agreement on common rules, would have acted as a natural brake on the pace and scope of integration.	整个欧洲社会模式的多元化，以及就共同规则达成一致的困难性，将成为一体化的节奏和范围的天然“刹车 ” 。
Far from being a disadvantage, this would have provided a useful corrective regarding the most desirable speed and extent of integration.	这绝不是劣势，而是将提供很有用的纠错，以实现一体化最恰当的速度和程度。
The result might have been a smaller EU, more deeply integrated across the board, or an EU with as many members as today, but much less ambitious in its economic scope.	结果可能是一个范围更小的欧盟，但一体化程度更加深化；或者一个成员数量和今天一样多的欧盟，但经济范围远远没有现在那么宏大。
Today it may be too late to attempt EU fiscal and political integration.	时至今日，尝试欧盟财政和政治一体化或许已经太迟。
Less than one in five Europeans favor shifting power away from the member nation-states.	只有不到五分之一的欧洲人支持民族国家成员国让渡权力。
Optimists might say that this is due less to aversion to Brussels or Strasbourg per se than to the public’s association of “more Europe” with a technocratic focus on the single market and the absence of an appealing alternative model.	乐观者会说，这是与其说是因为厌恶布鲁塞尔或斯特拉斯堡本身，毋宁说是因为公众结成了一个“更加欧洲”的联盟，它有一个技术官僚的重点：单一市场和缺少有吸引力的替代模式。
Perhaps emerging new leaders and political formations will manage to sketch out such a model and generate excitement about a reformed European project.	也许新出现的领导者和政治形式能够制定这样一个模式，并激发人们对改革欧洲工程的热情。
Pessimists, on the other hand, will hope that in the corridors of power in Berlin and Paris, in some deep, dark corner, economists and lawyers are secretly readying a plan B to deploy for the day when loosening the economic union can no longer be postponed.	另一方面，悲观者将希望，在柏林和巴黎的权力走廊中，在某个深藏的阴暗角落，经济学家和律师们正在秘密准备一套B计划，等着在经济联盟的解体变得无法阻挡的时候使出。
	
Making Sense of China’s Growth Model	理解中国增长模式
SHANGHAI – Although China’s economy has expanded at a staggering pace over the last three decades, its growth model is now widely agreed to be exhausted.	上海—尽管中国经济在过去三十年来扩张迅猛，但如今人们广泛认为其增长模式已经达到了极限。
Even China’s top leadership acknowledges the need for change – a belief that culminated in the far-reaching reform agenda presented two months ago at the Third Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party’s 18th Central Committee.	中国最高领导层也承认需要做出改变 — — 这一信念在十八大三中全会后所发布的意义深远的改革计划中尽显无疑。
While not everyone agrees on exactly what the new growth model should look like, proposals do not differ drastically, given the prevailing consensus that the current model rests on an unsustainable foundation.	对于新增长模式的具体内容，人们还有一些分歧，但各种方案之间并无剧烈差异，因为当前模式建立在不可持续的基础之上已成为压倒性共识。
On the demand side, many economists endorse a shift from investment-led to consumption-driven growth.	在需求端，许多经济学家认为应该从投资拉动转变为消费驱动型增长。
Even more popular is the supply-side recommendation of a shift from extensive to intensive growth – that is, from a model based on capital accumulation to one propelled by gains in efficiency, measured by total factor productivity (TFP).	供给端的建议更是毫无异议 — — 从粗放型增长转变为集约型增长，即从基于资本积累的模式转变效率推动模式。 效率的衡量标准则是全要素生产率（TFP ） 。
These recommendations are presumably influenced by Paul Krugman’s criticism in 1994 of Soviet-style extensive growth in East Asian economies (especially Singapore).	这些建议大概是受到了保罗·克鲁格曼（Paul Krugman）1994年对东亚经济体（特别是新加坡）的苏联式粗放型增长的批评的影响。
At the time, Jeffery Sachs disagreed, asserting that the East Asian model included far more efficient market-based investment allocation than the Soviet model did, and thus was unique; nonetheless, the criticism stuck.	当时，杰弗里·萨克斯（Jeffery Sachs）提出过异议，他认为东亚模式的效率远胜于苏联模式的、因为在前者，市场分配投资要比计划者分配投资有效率的多；尽管如此，萨克斯仍遭到了诟病。
It was not long before some Chinese economists began to categorize the growth pattern brought about three decades ago by Deng Xiaoping’s reforms as “extensive” – and thus problematic.	克鲁格曼的文章发表不久，一些中国经济学家开始将大约三十年前由邓小平改革带来的增长模式归类为“粗放型 ” ， 因而认定它有问题。
A consensus has gradually emerged around this idea, with calls for a shift toward intensive, efficiency-driven growth intensifying since China’s GDP growth began to slow in 2011.	在这一观点周围逐渐形成了一种共识，呼吁向集约型、效率推动型增长转变，这一呼声在2011年中国GDP增长出现减速后更加高涨了。
But empirical research reveals a fundamental problem with this argument: China’s TFP has grown at an average annual rate of nearly 4% since Deng’s reforms began.	但实证研究表明这一观点存在一个根本性的自相矛盾之处：自邓小平改革开始以来，中国TFP平均年增长率达到了近4 % 。
If the United States’ economy, with a TFP growth rate of only 1-2% annually, is considered efficiency-driven, why is China’s not?	如果TFP年增长率只有1—2%的美国经济可认为是效率推动型，为什么中国不是？
More important, if China’s TFP growth is expected to slow, as major drivers like the convergence effect wane, what does it mean to say that efficiency gains should propel China’s future growth?	更重要的是，如果随着趋同效应等主要推动力的减弱，预期中国未来的TFP增长将减缓而不是更高，那么说中国未来的增长要从因素驱动转变为主要由效率驱动该是什么意思呢？
Consider the facts.	我们来看看事实。
A conservative assessment by Louis Kuijs, working with the World Bank, shows that, from 1978 to 1994, China’s GDP grew by an average of 9.9% annually, labor productivity increased by 6.4%, TFP rose by 3%, and the capital-labor ratio increased by 2.9%.	世界银行的路易斯·库伊斯（Louis Kuijs）指出，从1978年到1994年，中国平均每年GDP增长9.9 % ， 劳动生产率增加6.4 % ， TFP提高3 % ， 劳动-资本比率增加2.9 % 。
In the period from 1994 to 2009, annual GDP growth averaged 9.6%, labor productivity increased by 8.6%, TFP increased by 2.7%, and the capital-labor ratio rose by 5.5%.	从1994年到2009年，平均每年GDP增长9.6 % ， 劳动生产率增加8.6 % ， TFP提高2.7 % ， 资本-劳动比率增加5.5 % 。
Similarly, Dwight Perkins and Tom Rawski found that from 1978 to 2005, China’s GDP grew by 9.5%, while capital investment grew by 9.6%, contributing 44.7% to GDP.	类似地，德怀特·珀金斯（Dwight Perkins）和汤姆·罗斯基（Tom Rawski）发现，从1978年到2005年，中国GDP年增长率为9.5 % ， 而资本投资增长率为9.6 % ， 贡献了44.7%的GDP增长。
The share of tertiary graduates in the labor force rose to 2.7% by 2005, accounting for 16.2% of GDP growth.	2005年，拥有大学学历的劳动力占比增加到2.7 % ， 贡献了16.2%的GDP增长。
And TFP grew by 3.8%, adding 40.1% to GDP growth.	TFP增长率为3.8 % ， 贡献了40.1%的GDP增长。
While capital has been the largest contributor to China’s GDP, the economy’s TFP performance has been impressive – something that cannot be explained by an extensive growth pattern.	资本是中国GDP增长率的最大贡献因素，这毋庸置疑。 但中国经济的TFP表现也令人印象深刻 — — 而这一现象却是无法用粗放型增长模式解释的。
Indeed, Japan’s rate of TFP growth never reached such high levels, even at the country’s economic peak.	事实上，日本的TFP增长率即使在经济高峰期也从未达到过如此高的水平。
Even Hong Kong – the East Asian economy with the best TFP performance – registered only 2.4% average annual TFP growth from 1960 to 1990.	甚至在东亚经济体中TFP表现最为出色的香港在1960年到1990年期间的平均年TFP增长率也只有2.4 % 。
But annual TFP growth is not the only relevant figure. China’s TFP has contributed 35-40% to GDP growth, compared to an estimated 20-30% in East Asia’s “four tigers” (Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan).	而且，中国的TFP贡献了35—40%的GDP增长，而东亚“四小龙 ” （ 香港、新加坡、韩国和台湾）的这一比例估计只有20—30 % 。
As for the Soviet Union, even in its best years, TFP accounted for only about 10% of GDP growth.	至于苏联，即使在最佳年份，TFP也只贡献了GDP增长的10%左右。
Though China’s TFP contribution to GDP growth is much greater than in the other so-called “extensive” economies, it remains well below levels in the intensive US economy, where the figure exceeds 80% – a divergence that some might use to justify their refusal to define China’s economy as “efficiency-driven.”	有人可以质疑说，中国的TFP对GDP增长的贡献尽管远高于其他所谓的“粗放型”经济体，但仍低于集约型的美国经济。 美国经济的这一比例超过80 % — —有人或许会援引这一差异证明不能将中国经济归类为“效率驱动型”是合理的。
But this argument ignores the fact that China has been experiencing double-digit annual GDP growth, owing largely to capital expansion, while America’s annual GDP growth has averaged only 2-3%.	但这一观点忽略了一个事实，即中国一直保持着两位数的GDP年增长率，而美国的年增长率平均只有2—3 % 。
If transforming China’s growth pattern were simply a matter of increasing TFP’s contribution to GDP to US levels, China’s annual GDP growth would have to drop to below 5% – three percentage points lower than its potential growth rate.	如果那些希望中国增长模式转型的人只是希望让中国的TFP对GDP的贡献份额增加到美国的水平，那么中国年GDP增长率就应该降到5%以下 — — 比其潜在增长率低三个百分点。
Given 8% GDP growth, TFP would have to grow 6.4% annually.	不然的话，若GDP增长率为8 % ， 则TFP必须每年提高6.4 % ， 从而使得TFP对GDP增长的贡献率达到80%的水平。
This is almost certainly impossible, owing to the gradual diminution of the major drivers – including market-oriented economic reforms, the convergence effect on per capita income, and the adoption of foreign technologies – of China’s extraordinary TFP growth over the last 30 years.	但这几乎是不可能的任务，因为过去三十多年卓越TFP增长表现的主要发动机 — — 包括市场经济改革、人均收入的趋同效应和吸纳外国技术等 — — 在逐渐失去动力。
All of this raises a simple question: Do extensive- or intensive-growth models really exist?	所有这些引出了一个简单问题：粗放型和集约型增长模式真的存在吗？
Perhaps there is only fast versus slow, or extraordinary versus ordinary.	也许这只不过是快与慢、卓越与平庸之间的差别。
According to this view, if a developing economy can realize extraordinary growth, it must be because it offers greater opportunities for capital expansion than a developed economy.	根据这一观点，如果某个发展中经济体实现了卓越的增长表现，其原因一定是它提供了比发达经济体更好的资本扩张机会。
After all, investment opportunity is inversely proportional to per capita capital stock.	毕竟，投资机会与人均资本存量水平呈现反比关系。
On this point, Krugman is right: such investment-fueled growth is achieved largely through perspiration, rather than inspiration.	在这一点上，克鲁格曼是正确的：如此投资驱动的增长大体上是通过汗水，而不是灵感实现的。
But so what?	但那又怎么样？
The fact that some of Asia’s most dynamic economies – including China, Japan, and the four tigers (Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan) – have experienced investment-propelled growth and improvements in TFP simultaneously can be explained by the fact that TFP gains increase investment returns, accelerating capital expansion further.	一些亚洲最有活力的经济体 — — 包括中国、日本和四小龙 — — 同时经历了投资驱动的增长和TFP改善，这一事实可以用TFP的改善提高了投资回报、进一步加速了资本扩张这一事实来解释。
Though further analysis is needed to elucidate the long-term relationship between capital expansion and TFP, it is clear that the long-accepted theory that they cannot co-exist is seriously flawed.	尽管我们需要更进一步的分析澄清资本扩张和TFP之间的长期关系，但显然人们长期所接受的它们不可以共存的理论有严重缺陷。
In short, when it comes to Asian economies, the dichotomy of extensive and intensive growth is a red herring.	简而言之，对于亚洲经济体，粗放增长和集约增长的二分法纯属刻舟求剑。
A far more meaningful consideration is what drove these TFP gains; understanding that would enable China’s leaders to design a more effective plan for strengthening the economy’s long-term growth prospects.	更有意义的是考察什么推动了TFP增长，明白这一点这有助于中国领导人设计出更有效地增强中国经济长期前景的计划。
	
Li’s Balancing Act	李克强的平衡手法
SHANGHAI – Three years of persistent economic slowdown have rattled Chinese economists and policymakers.	上海—三年的持续经济减速让中国经济学家和决策者有些乱了方寸。
Financial analysts are in a tizzy over whether GDP growth will fall below 7%, parsing official statements for clues as to whether and when the government will act.	金融分析师对于GDP增长是否会降到7%以下十分紧张，试图在官方陈述中挖掘政府是否会采取行动的蛛丝马迹。
The government’s financial viziers seem none too alarmed.	政府财政部门似乎并没有感到多少警觉。
Beneath this cool exterior, however, China’s leaders are very worried indeed.	但是，在平静的表面下，中国领导人实际上是相当忧虑的。
As Liu Shijin, Vice Minister of the Development Research Center of the State Council, recently explained, the dilemma facing the authorities is that another massive stimulus plan to boost growth would mean more outstanding credit – a problematic approach, given the enormous debt and financial risks that local governments have accumulated.	国务院发展研究中心副主任刘世锦最近解释说，当局面临的困难是再次实施大规模刺激计划提振增长将导致更多的未偿还信用 — — 考虑到地方政府已经积累了巨大的债务和金融风险，这一方法是有问题的。
But an excessively sluggish economy poses its own risks.	但经济过度停滞不前也会带来风险。
To be sure, China’s government was in a similar situation ten years ago.	平心而论，中国政府的处境与十年前有些相似。
But the economy today is not performing as it was a decade ago.	但如今的经济表现不如十年前。
China needs new solutions.	中国需要新办法。
To varying degrees, China’s economy has long swung from short-term growth spurts, fueled by the over-issuance of currency and conventional credit expansion, to contraction, triggered by government action to prevent overheating.	从某种程度上说，中国经济早已从受货币超发和常规信用扩张刺激的短期增长井喷转变为由政府抑制过热的措施引发的收缩。
Once the risks are under control, the government gradually restores growth-oriented policies.	一旦风险得到控制，政府会逐渐恢复增长导向政策。
This “prosperity cycle” – sustained by the abundance of new investment opportunities that were available to neutralize mounting debt and financial risks – has long enabled China to avoid a hard landing.	长期以来，这一“繁荣周期 ” — —通过充足易得的新投资机会将日益积累的债务和金融风险中性化 — — 让中国得以避免硬着陆。
A decade ago, when China was fighting deflation, the World Trade Organization came to its rescue, opening up massive new export markets.	十年前，中国的主要问题是通缩，世界贸易组织打开了巨大的新出口市场,成了中国的救星。
More important, the huge dividend of the just-launched domestic housing reform had yet to pay off.	更重要的是，刚刚启动的国内住房改革还有巨大的红利可供收割。
The resulting surge of new investment opportunities diminished the risks posed by idle capital and risky debt, while driving increases in investment efficiency and labor productivity.	由此带来的新投资机会的大量涌现抑制了闲置资本和高风险债务带来的风险，同时也推动了投资效率和劳动生产率的提高。
But the latest round of deflation-fighting policies, together with the massive stimulus package that the government launched in the wake of the global economic crisis, has led to oversupply in the housing market and idle capital in the manufacturing sector.	但最近的反通缩政策加上政府在全球经济危机时所采取的大规模刺激计划导致了房地产市场的供给过度和制造业的闲置资本。
Making matters worse, demand for Chinese exports in Europe and the United States has weakened considerably, and is not expected to rebound.	更糟糕的是，欧洲和美国对中国出口的需求大幅降低，并且在中长期看起来也反弹无望。
All of this has diminished short-term investment opportunities in China, raising fears of a hard landing.	所有这些都抑制了中国的短期投资机会的出现，引起了硬着陆之忧。
Of course, China still boasts tremendous investment potential in the long term, especially given the relatively low urbanization rate and the need for structural reform and industrial upgrading.	当然，从长期看，中国仍有巨大的投资潜力，特别是考虑到其相对较低的城镇化率以及结构性改革和产业升级的需要。
In the interim, however, Premier Li Keqiang’s government must achieve a prudent balance between economic growth and financial risk.	但是，在中期，李克强总理的政府必须在经济增长和金融风险之间取得审慎的平衡。
To that end, the government has adjusted its policy target from “economic recovery” to “growth stabilization,” expressing its willingness to accept declining GDP growth up to a certain point – probably 7%, or even lower – in order to keep financial risk under control.	在这方面，政府的政策目标已从“经济复苏”转为“稳增长 ” ， 表现出接受GDP增长降到一定程度 — — 可能是7%甚至更低 — — 以保持金融风险可控的意愿。
But the balance itself is not the goal.	但平衡本身并非目标。
In Li’s view, what the government really needs to do is buy time for structural adjustment and reform, which are critical to generating the next wave of investment opportunities.	在李克强看来，政府真正需要做的是为结构性调整和改革赢得时间，而后两者又是创造新一轮投资机会的关键。
Li has even adopted a structural approach to stimulating economic growth.	李克强甚至在刺激经济增长的问题上持有结构性观点。
For example, the mini-stimulus package that was unveiled last month diverts investment to railroads, agriculture, the smart grid, and other productive services.	比如，上个月实施的微刺激方案以铁路、农业、智能电网和其他生产性服务为投资目标。
But maintaining this balance will not be easy.	但维持这一平衡并不容易。
The first challenge will be to ensure that the real-estate market progresses into the adjustment and clearance phases.	第一个挑战是确保房地产市场向调整和清理阶段平稳发展。
This will require cautious but continuous policy action.	这需要谨慎而持续的政策动作。
The good news is that many local governments have recently loosened their grip on local real-estate markets, most likely following a central-government directive.	好消息是，许多地方政府已开始放松对本地房地产市场的控制，这很有可能是遵照了中央政府的指示。
This could be the start of a virtuous circle, with price adjustments helping to clear up stock.	这或许是良性循环的开端，让价格调整帮助出清存货。
The movement of the housing market into a clearance phase, without causing a panic or collapsing, would be a crowning achievement for Li’s tenure.	房地产市场向清理阶段运行而不引起恐慌或崩溃将是李克强执政生涯的一大成就。
Another major challenge is managing credit risk.	另一个主要挑战是管理信用风险。
This will require policies that reduce the rate of credit expansion, without putting so much pressure on local governments and state-owned enterprises that they turn to off-balance-sheet credit and the shadow-banking sector.	这需要能降低信用扩张速度的政策，并且不能给地方政府和国有企业太大压力导致它们转向表外信用和影子银行。
Moreover, the government must revitalize the stock of local-government assets and credit by securitizing these portfolios.	此外，政府必须盘活地方政府资产存量和信用，这可以通过将其投资组合证券化实现。
The problem is that China’s domestic capital market remains underdeveloped, owing to administrative restrictions, a non-diverse structure, and a lack of innovation – all of which means that progress in the short term is unlikely.	问题在于，拜行政限制、结构多元化不足和缺乏创新所赐，中国国内证券市场仍欠发达，而这三大问题在短期都很难取得进展。
This highlights the need for structural reforms aimed at creating a more efficient, open, and competitive capital market, commensurate with the size of the economy.	这就凸显出旨在创造更有效、更开放、更具竞争性的、与经济规模相称的资本市场的结构性改革的必要。
This would facilitate the production of innovative financial products, link monetary policy more closely with capital markets, and allow fixed assets to become liquid (and vice versa).	结构性改革有利于产生创新金融产品、加强货币政策与资本市场的联系、增加存货资产的流动性（反之亦然 ） 。
A multi-tiered capital market and diverse financial products can help to free China from its excessive dependence on credit.	长期而言，多层次资本市场和多元化金融产品有助于让中国摆脱对信用的过度依赖。
But that will require change in the way that the Chinese government manages the macroeconomy.	但这需要中国政府改变宏观经济管理模式。
And that is a story for another day.	这是未来金融改革的重点。
	
China’s Untapped Growth Potential	中国增长潜力未竟
SHANGHAI – China’s economic slowdown, from a nearly 10% annual output gain in 2007 to below 8% today, has fueled widespread speculation about the economy’s growth potential.	上海—中国年产出增长率从2007年的近10%下降到如今的8 % ， 经济的减速让关于中国经济增长潜力的猜测四起。
While it is impossible to predict China’s future growth trajectory, understanding the economy’s underlying trends is the best way to derive a meaningful estimate.	预测中国未来增长轨迹是不可能的，但理解中国经济的基本趋势是进行有意义的估计的最佳方法。
Whereas short-term demand largely dictates an economy’s real growth rate, its potential growth rate is determined on the supply side.	短期需求大致上表明了一个经济体的实际增长率，但其潜在增长率由供给面决定。
Some economists – citing indicators like investment ratios, industrial value-added, and employment – compare China to Japan in the early 1970’s.	一些经济学家引用投资比率、工业增加值和就业等指标比较中国和20世纪70年代初的日本。
After more than two decades of sustained rapid growth, Japan’s economy slackened considerably in 1971, leading to four decades of annual growth rates averaging less than 4%.	1971年，在经历了二十多年的持续快速增长后，日本经济显著地放缓了脚步，此后四十年，年均增长率不到4 % 。
This correlation is reinforced by the convergence hypothesis – the benchmark theory for estimating an economy’s potential growth rate – which states that a rapidly growing developing economy’s real growth rate will slow when it reaches a certain share of the per capita capital stock and income of an advanced economy.	趋同假说 — — 估算一国经济潜在增长率的基本理论 — — 认为快速增长的发展中经济体的实际增长率会在其人均资本存量和收入达到发达经济体的一定比例时出现放缓。 这一假说加强了这一相关性。
According to the economists Barry Eichengreen, Donghyun Park, and Kwanho Shin, that share is about 60% of America’s per capita income (at 2005 international prices).	根据经济学家巴里·艾肯格林（Barry Eichengreen ） 、 朴东炫（Donghyun Park）和康镐炫（Kwanho Shin）的研究，这一比例大约是美国人均收入的60 % （ 以2005年国际价格计算 ） 。
At first glance, the experiences of Asia’s most advanced economies – Japan and the four “Asian Tigers” (Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan) – seem to be consistent with this theory.	乍一看，亚洲最发达经济体 — — 日本和“亚洲四小龙 ” （ 香港、新加坡、韩国和台湾 ） — —都符合这一理论。
In 1971-1973, Japan’s per capita GDP fell to roughly 65% of that of the United States in purchasing-power-parity terms, while the Asian Tigers experienced economic downturns of varying degrees when they reached roughly the same income level relative to Japan.	1971—1973年，按购买力平价计算的日本人均GDP落在美国的65%左右，而亚洲四小龙也在到达相对日本的类似收入水平时经历了不同程度的经济放缓。
But Eichengreen, Park, and Shin also found that once this income level is reached, annual growth rates tend to fall by no more than two percentage points.	但艾肯格林、朴东炫和康镐炫还发现，一旦收入水平达到这一水平，年增长率的下降一般不会超过两个百分点。
This means that GDP growth should have slowed gradually in Japan after 1971, instead of plummeting by more than 50%.	这意味着日本GDP增长应该在1971年后逐渐放缓，而不应该大幅降低超过50 % 。
Likewise, given the remaining income gap with the US, the Asian Tigers should have grown faster than they have in the last two decades.	类似地，亚洲四小龙与美国仍然存在收入差距，因此在过去二十年中，它们本应增长得更快。
But they each suffered a substantial slowdown (albeit less sharp than Japan’s).	但所有四小龙都经历了大幅放缓（尽管没有日本那么剧烈 ） 。
These inconsistencies can be explained by external shocks – a point emphasized by Hideo Kobayashi in his book Post-War Japanese Economy and Southeast Asia.	这些不一致可以用外部冲击来解释 — — 小林英夫（Hideo Kobayashi）的著作《战后日本经济和东南亚 》 （ Post-War Japanese Economy and Southeast Asia）强调了这一点。
During Japan’s economic boom, its total factor productivity (TFP, or the efficiency with which inputs are used) contributed about 40% to GDP growth.	在日本经济繁荣期，其全要素生产率（TFP，或投入的使用效率）贡献了40%的GDP增长。
When growth plummeted, TFP fell even faster – a dramatic change that was clearly linked to the 1971 yen appreciation and the 1973 oil crisis.	当增长大幅降速时，TFP下降得更快 — — 这一戏剧性变化显然与1971年日元升值和1973年石油危机有关。
From a microeconomic perspective, a sudden exchange-rate shock and sharp increase in oil prices impedes firms’ ability to adjust their technology and production methods to meet new cost conditions, eventually undermining TFP growth.	从微观经济学角度看，突发汇率冲击和石油价格暴涨妨碍了企业调整技术和生产方式从而适应新的成本条件的能力，最终伤害了TFP增长。
Such a cost shock has a more prolonged effect than a negative demand shock.	这样的成本冲击具有比消极需求冲击更长的影响期。
Without negative external shocks, exorbitant TFP growth would have declined gradually, as the returns from institutional adjustment, reallocation of resources, and technological catch-up naturally diminished, in accordance with the convergence hypothesis.	根据趋同假说，制度调整、资源再配置和技术赶超的回报会自然衰减，因此，如果没有消极外部冲击，过高的TFP增长会逐渐下降。
External shocks also explain China’s GDP slowdown since 2007.	外部冲击还解释了中国GDP在2007年之后的减速。
The renminbi’s gradual yet sustained appreciation against the US dollar is the cost shock’s main driver, but the demand shock that followed the 2008 global financial crisis aggravated the situation.	人民币逐渐而持续的对美元升值是成本冲击的主要推动力，但随2008年金融危机到来的需求冲击加重了困局。
It is likely that TFP has declined substantially as China’s economy has slowed in response to these shocks.	有可能中国经济因为这些冲击而出现的减速导致了TFP大幅下降。
Unlike Keynesians, who focus on demand shocks, followers of the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter view cost shocks as important potential catalysts for structural reform and industrial upgrading – both of which are needed to avoid falling into a low-growth rut in the long term.	与关注需求冲击的凯恩斯主义者不同，美国经济学家约瑟夫·熊彼特（Joseph Schumacher）的追随者认为成本冲击是结构性改革和产业升级的重要潜在催化剂，而结构性改革和产业升级又是避免陷入长期低增长陷阱之必须。
In the short term, a cost shock devastates some economic activities, forcing companies either to shut down or move on to another line of business.	在短期，成本冲击会毁灭一些经济活动，迫使公司关门或转向其他业务。
But what Schumpeter called “creative destruction” can facilitate the eventual emergence and expansion of new, more efficient firms.	但熊彼特所谓的“创造性破坏”能够有利于更高效的新企业的最终产生和扩张。
The problem is that many country-specific factors, such as political concerns and pressure from vested interests, can impede this process.	问题在于许多国别因素 — — 比如政治顾虑和来自既得利益的压力 — — 可能阻碍这一过程。
In this sense, China’s government is facing an important test.	从这个角度讲，中国政府正面临着重要考验。
If it fails to take advantage of the opportunity provided by the cost shock and economic slowdown to implement the necessary structural reforms, China’s potential growth rate, as dictated by TFP, will never rebound fully.	如果政府不能利用成本冲击和经济减速带来的机会实施必要的结构性改革，中国的潜在增长率将如TFP所显示的那样永远无法完全恢复。
Given that improving overall productivity is the best way to defend against cost shocks, the new round of structural reform should be aimed at creating conditions for economic transformation and upgrading.	改善总体生产率是抵抗成本冲击的最佳办法，因此新一轮结构性改革应该以创造经济转型和升级的条件为目标。
The key is to establish a level playing field guided by market rules, reduce government intervention in the economy, and stop protecting inefficient businesses.	关键在于建立由市场规则引导的公平平台，减少政府对经济的干预，并停止保护低效率企业。
Such efforts would go a long way toward increasing China’s potential growth rate.	这些举措将大大有利于增加中国的潜在增长率。
Indeed, considering that China’s per capita income amounts to only about 10-20% of that of the US, with massive regional differentials within China, its growth potential, as dictated by the convergence hypothesis, is far from tapped.	事实上，考虑到中国人均收入只有美国的10—20 % ， 且国内地区差距巨大，从趋同假说看，其增长潜力还远远没有到头。
But the degree to which it can fulfill this potential in the coming decades will depend largely on its TFP prospects.	但未来数十年中能在多大程度上实现这一潜力很大程度上取决于其TFP前景。
In 2007, the economists Dwight Perkins and Thomas Rawski estimated that, in order for China’s economy to maintain a 9% growth rate and a 25-35% investment ratio until 2025, it would need to maintain an annual TFP growth rate of 4.3-4.8%.	2007年，经济学家德怀特·珀金斯（Dwight Perkins）和托马斯·罗斯基（Thomas Rawski）估算，中国要想在2025年之前维持9%的增长率和25—35%的投资比率，需要将年TFP增长率保持在4.3—4.8 % 。
Given that China’s TFP growth has averaged 4% for more than 30 years, and is likely to slow in the coming decade, this scenario is improbable.	三十多年来，中国TFP平均增长率为4 % ， 并且可能在未来十年有所下降，因此这一情景可能无法实现。
Maintaining 6% annual GDP growth with the same investment ratio would require annual TFP growth of only 2.2-2.7%.	维持6%的GDP年增长和相同的投资比率要求年TFP增长达到2.2—2.7%即可。
With China’s productivity still well below that of developed countries, and allocational efficiency likely to improve in the next ten years as labor and capital are redistributed across the country, 3% TFP growth is feasible.	中国的生产率仍显著低于发达国家；而随着劳动力和资本在全国的重新分配，未来十年配置效率改进可期，因此，3%的TFP增长率是可行的。
Aided by structural reforms, China’s economy could expand even faster, achieving 7-8% annual growth over the next ten years.	在结构性改革的助力下，未来十年中国经济可以扩张得更快，达到7—8%的年增长。
Either way, convergence will remain swift.	无论如何，趋同都会保持快速。
	
China’s High-Income Hopes	中国的高收入希望
SHANGHAI – It is widely agreed that economic development means more than GDP growth.	上海—一个被广泛接受的观点是经济发展不仅仅意味着GDP增长。
As China is now learning, one does not guarantee the other.	中国现在知道，增长和发展并非有此即有彼的关系。
Unless China’s leaders upgrade the country’s growth strategy to stimulate technological progress and structural transformation, high-income status will continue to elude the world’s second-largest economy and most populous country.	除非中国领导人改革增长战略以刺激技术进步和制度转型，否则高收入将仍是这个世界第二大经济体和第一大人口国可望而不可及的成就。
To be sure, China’s growth strategy – powered by investment in infrastructure, a massive increase in low-cost manufacturing exports, and technology transfers – has led to some structural change.	平心而论，中国的增长战略 — — 受基础设施、低成本制造业出口大规模增长和技术转移推动 — — 已经带来了可观的结构变化。
As labor and capital moved from low-productivity sectors and regions to high-productivity activities, resource allocation became more efficient, real wages rose, and the economic structure was upgraded.	随着劳动力和资本从低生产率部门和地区转移到高生产率活动去，资源配置也变得更有效率，真实工资有所增长，经济结构也获得了升级。
But the growth strategies that lift a poor country to middle-income levels cannot be counted upon to propel it to high-income status.	但让一个穷国步入中等收入行列的增长战略是无法继续执行同样的增长战略让这个国家实现高收入的。
Indeed, there is no shortage of countries whose leaders have failed to recognize their strategies’ constraints and provide enough incentives to encourage the emergence of a new one, causing their economies to stagnate and leaving them stuck in the so-called “middle-income trap.”	事实上，有许多国家，其领导人没有认识到增长战略的约束条件并给予足够的激励鼓励新战略，结果导致经济陷入停滞，受困于所谓的“中等收入陷阱 ” 。
Perhaps the most notable exceptions to this rule have been in East Asia, where four economies – South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore – responded to external crises and challenges by shifting their growth strategies.	也许这一规律最令人瞩目的例外就在亚洲，四个经济体 — — 韩国、中国台湾、中国香港和新加坡 — — 通过改变增长战略成功地应对了外部危机和挑战。
For China, whose growth model has so far resembled that used by these economies before they attained middle-income status, a similar shift is urgently needed.	对中国来说，其步入中等收入行列前的增长战略一直效仿以上四个经济体，现在也迫切需要类似的转变。
As the late Yale economist Gustav Ranis observed nearly 20 years ago, the key to successful and sustainable development is “avoiding the encrustation of ideas.”	已故的耶鲁经济学家古斯塔夫·拉尼斯（Gustav Ranis）在近20年前观察道，成功而可持续的发展的关键是“避免思维僵化 ” 。
For Chinese policymakers, this means recognizing the need to abandon some of the fundamental ideas that underpinned the economy’s past growth, before they become so firmly encrusted that they jeopardize the country’s development prospects.	对中国决策者来说，这意味着认识到必须在一些作为中国经济过去增长基础的基本思维形成顽固惯性、破坏中国发展前景之前抛弃它们。
The first problem is China’s enduring dependence on exports.	第一个问题是中国对出口战略的可能的长期依赖。
In the early stages of economic development, almost all growth strategies boil down to trade strategies.	在经济发展的早期阶段，几乎所有增长战略都可以归结为贸易战略。
But China’s export-led growth model has limits – and the country is reaching them.	但中国的出口拉动型增长模式存在极限，并且已肯快靠近那个极限。
Unless change comes soon, the foreign-exchange regime and capital controls on which the model relies will become too deeply entrenched, and the window of opportunity for adjustment will be missed.	除非很快采取变化，否则作为这一模式的基础的外汇机制和资本管制将会变得过于根深蒂固，调整的机会窗口也会错失。
Another risk is that China’s leaders continue to delay efforts to expand the services sector – including finance, insurance, wholesale and retail trade, and logistics – in the hope that the economy can continue to depend on manufacturing.	另一个风险是中国领导人可能继续推延开放服务部门的措施 — — 包括金融、保险、批发和零售贸易、物流等诸领域 — — 以期经济能继续依赖制造业。
Given how difficult it can be to gain support for such efforts, especially compared to policies aimed at boosting manufacturing, liberalization and expansion of the services sector will require a strong commitment from China’s government.	开放服务部门的措施很难赢得支持，特别是与旨在提振制造业的政策相比，因此服务部门的自由化和开放需要中国政府的大决心。
Here, Japan’s failure in opening up its services sector – which impeded its ability to adapt its economic structure to its declining demographic dividend – can provide much-needed motivation.	在这方面，日本曾经欲开放服务部门而失败，结果掣肘了其调整经济结构应对人口红利下降局面的能力，这给了中国所急需的鞭策。
The final idea at risk of blocking further progress is that political transformation would undermine social order.	阻碍未来前景的最后一种思维是政治转型会破坏社会秩序。
One of the East Asian economies’ major lessons for developing countries is that economic development leads to institutional transformation, not the other way around.	东亚经济体给发展中国家留下的主要智慧之一是经济发展会导致政治制度转变，而不是相反。
In Taiwan and South Korea, for example, authoritarian governments after World War II compensated for the weakness of the rule of law by creating transitional institutional arrangements to facilitate GDP growth.	比如，在中国台湾和韩国，二战后的威权政府创造了过渡性制度安排来刺激GDP增长，以此弥补法制的不足。
In this sense, China has a significant advantage.	在这方面，中国拥有巨大优势。
Countries with weak government capacity have rarely managed to achieve high-income status.	相反，政府能力不够强的国家很少能够成功步入中等收入行列。
But, as the description of these arrangements as “transitional” suggests, they cannot last indefinitely.	但是，顾名思义，这些“过渡性”安排无法永远持续下去。
After 35 years of dependence on such arrangements, China must embrace the rule of law and establish a reliable, independent judicial system capable of facilitating the liberalization of the services sector, protecting intellectual-property rights, and underpinning a competitive market-based system.	中国依赖这一安排已逾35年，现在必须接受法制精神，建立能够刺激服务部门自由化、保护知识财产权利、成为竞争性市场经济制度基石的可靠而独立的司法体系。
In short, the biggest risk to China’s continued development is not a crisis, but the failure of its political leaders and intellectual elites to recognize the need to transform a growth strategy that has proved successful so far.	简言之，中国后续发展的最大风险不是危机，而是政治领导人和知识精英有没有认识到扬弃到目前为止一直成功的增长战略的必要性。
In fact, to the extent that a crisis could do more good than harm, warnings that the rapid credit expansion of recent years could trigger a debt crisis, or that the real-estate sector is on the verge of collapse, may not be as worrying as many believe.	事实上，危机或许利大于弊，因此警告近几年来的信用高速扩张可能引发债务危机，或者房地产部门眼看就要崩溃或许并不像许多人认为的那样令人担忧。
Ideally, no such crisis would be needed.	在理想状况下，这样的危机并不需要。
In this scenario, China’s economic slowdown since 2008, which could be viewed as China’s first modern growth crisis, would be sufficient to force China’s leaders to shift their focus from supporting double-digit annual GDP increases to restructuring the economy.	在这一情形中，中国经济从2008年开始减速，这可以视为中国的第一次现代增长危机，已足以迫使中国领导人将注意力从支持两位数的年GDP增长率转向重组经济结构。
In fact, a consensus already appears to be emerging concerning the need to reduce China’s dependence on exports, expand trade in services, attract more foreign investment to its services sector, and accelerate the liberalization of exchange rates, interest rates, and cross-border capital flows – exemplified in the establishment of the Shanghai Pilot Free-Trade Zone last year.	事实上，关于降低中国的出口依赖、开放其服务贸易、吸引更多外资投资于服务部门以及加速汇率、利率和跨境资本流自由化的问题似乎已经有了共识，去年的上海自由贸易区试点就是明证。
And, following the Third Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party’s 18th Central Committee last November, China’s leaders declared their commitment to allowing the market to play a greater role in shaping economic outcomes.	此外，在去年11月的中共十八大三中全会后，中国领导人承诺要让市场在决定经济结果中起到更大的作用。
These are undoubtedly steps in the right direction.	毫无疑问，这些都是迈向正确方向的步骤。
The question is whether China’s leaders will follow through on their declarations before it is too late.	问题在于中国领导人是否能在仍然来得及的时候兑现承诺。
	
The ECB’s Leap into the Unknown	欧洲央行跃向未知
FRANKFURT – The European Central Bank is in the middle of a big, risky experiment.	法兰克福—欧洲央行正在实施一项大型高风险实验。
Key interest rates have remained close to zero for six years now.	如今，关键利率保持近零水平已有六年。
Financial markets are flooded with liquidity.	金融市场充斥着流动性。
Crisis management has resulted in major market distortions, with some segments’ performance no longer explainable by fundamental economic data.	危机管理导致了巨大的市场扭曲，一些细分市场的表现已不再能用经济基本面数据解释。
The unintended consequences of this policy are increasingly visible – and will become increasingly tangible with the US Federal Reserve’s exit from post-2008 ultra-loose monetary policy.	这一政策的意外后果正变得日益清晰，随着美联储退出其2008年以来的极度宽松政策，其后果还会变的更加明确。
And yet Europe’s crisis is far from over, as the decisions by the European Central Bank’s Governing Council in June and September demonstrate.	而欧洲危机还远未结束，欧洲央行管理委员会6月和 9月的决定说明了一切。
This reflects two factors: too little ambition in carrying out essential balance-sheet corrections, and slow progress – negligible in France and Italy – in restructuring Europe’s national economies.	这反映出两个因素：实施关键性资产负债表修正的决定不够，以及欧洲各国政府重组进展缓慢（法国和意大利就是明证 ） 。
The ECB’s decision to double down on monetary stimulus should thus be regarded as an act of desperation.	因此，欧洲央行决定将货币刺激加倍的决定应该被视为绝望的行动。
Its key rate has been cut to 0.05%, the deposit rate is negative, and targeted longer-term refinancing operations are supposed to support bank lending.	其关键利率已下降至0.05 % ， 存款利率已为负值，定向长期再融资操作意在支持银行放贷。
Moreover, the asset-backed securities market is to be revived by the purchase of ABSs.	此外，资产支持证券（ABS）市场将因购买ABS的计划而得到复苏。
All of this is intended to flood the markets, expand the euro system’s balance sheet by €700 billion ($890 billion), and return to the balance-sheet volume recorded at the start of 2012.	所有这些都是为了提振市场、将欧元系统的资产负债表扩大7,000亿欧元，并使其回到2012年初创下的纪录水平。
The expansion of the ECB’s balance sheet and the targeted depreciation of the euro should help to bring the eurozone’s short-term inflation rate close to 2% and thus reduce deflationary risks.	欧洲央行资产负债表的扩张以及欧元的定向贬值应该有助于让欧元区短期通胀率接近2 % ， 从而降低通缩风险。
For the first time in its history, the ECB appears to be pursuing an exchange-rate target.	欧洲央行有史以来第一次开始追求汇率目标。
As was the case for the Bank of Japan, the external value of the currency will become an important instrument in the framework of a new strategic approach.	和日本银行一样，货币的外部价值将成为新战略方针框架中的一个重要工具。
Financial markets have applauded the ECB’s recent decisions.	金融市场非常欢迎欧洲央行的最新举措。
Moreover, having “effectively thrown off all of the Maastricht Treaty restrictions that bound the bank to the model of the Deutsche Bundesbank,” as former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan put it, the ECB is prepared to break further taboos.	此外，如美联储主席艾伦·格林斯潘（Alan Greenspan）所指出的 ， “ 事实上抛弃了所有马斯特里赫特条约限制、不再受德意志联邦银行模式约束”的欧洲央行已准备好进一步打破更多禁忌。
But for what purpose?	但其目的何在？
Particularly by guaranteeing highly indebted countries’ sovereign bonds, the ECB has actually weakened the willingness to reform, particularly in the larger European Union countries, whose decrepit economic structures are an obstacle to potential growth, and where more room must be given to private initiative.	欧洲央行的行为，特别是担保高负债国家主权债券的行为，实际上削弱了改革意愿，特别是在过时的济结构已成为潜在增长障碍的欧盟中较大的国家以及必须给私人行动更大空间的领域。
The ECB’s willingness to buy ABSs is especially risky and creates a new element of joint liability in the eurozone, with European taxpayers on the hook in the event of a loss.	欧洲央行愿意购买ABS，这已决定风险极高，并且给欧元区注入了新的共同债务因素，如若发生损失，将由欧洲纳税人买单。
The ECB lacks the democratic legitimacy to take such far-reaching decisions, with potentially substantial redistributive effects, which implies an even greater risk to monetary-policy independence.	欧洲央行采取这些影响重大、具有巨大的潜在再分配效应（因此意味着更大的货币政策独立性风险）的决定缺少民主合法性。
Indeed, the ECB already has been driven onto the defensive by the International Monetary Fund, the OECD, financial-market analysts, and Anglo-Saxon economists in the wake of feverish discussion of the risk of deflation in the eurozone.	事实上，在关于欧元区通缩风险的喧闹的争论中，欧洲央行在国际货币基金组织、经合组织、金融市场分析师和盎格鲁-撒克逊经济学家的攻势下相当被动。
But what is the appropriate eurozone inflation rate, given de facto economic stagnation?	但在实际经济停滞的环境下，什么才是欧元区恰当的失业率？
Should higher nominal (that is, inflation-driven) growth replace debt-driven growth?	应该用更高的名义（即通胀驱动的）增长代替债务驱动的增长吗？
Europe must aim for sustainable, non-inflationary growth and the creation of competitive jobs.	欧洲必须将目标放在可持续、非通胀性的增长以及竞争性就业岗位的创造上。
The current inflation rate of 0.3% is due to the significant decline in commodity prices and the painful but unavoidable adjustment of costs and prices in the peripheral countries.	当前0.3%的通货膨胀率是商品价格的大跌和外围国不可避免的痛苦的成本和价格调整的结果。
Only Greece currently has a slightly negative inflation rate.	只有希腊当前通胀率略为负值。
In other words, price stability reigns in the eurozone.	换句话说，价格稳定是欧元区的普遍现象。
This strengthens purchasing power and ultimately private consumption.	这增强了购买力，最终有利于私人消费。
The ECB has fulfilled its mandate for the present and the foreseeable future.	欧洲央行已经完成了当前和可预见未来的使命。
There is no need for policy action in the short term.	短期没有采取政策动作的必要。
It is, instead, the eurozone governments that must act.	反之，欧元区政府必须行动起来。
But any clear division of tasks and responsibilities between governments and central banks has, it seems, been jettisoned.	但任何各个政府和央行之间的明确的任务和责任分割都被放弃了。
Government action in many problem countries ultimately ends in finger pointing: “Europe,” the ECB, and Germany, with its (relatively) responsible policy, have all been scapegoats.	许多问题国家的政府行动最终沦为互相指责的 ： “ 欧洲 ” 、 欧洲央行、德国及其（相对）负责任的政策都成了替罪羊。
Against this background, the ECB has yielded to immense political pressure, particularly from France and Italy, to loosen monetary policy further and weaken the exchange rate.	在这样的背景下，欧洲央行屈服于巨大的政治压力，特别是来自法国和意大利的压力，进一步放松了货币政策、贬值了汇率。
But indulging the old political reflex of manipulating the exchange rate to create a competitive advantage will yield a short-term fix at best.	但沉溺于操纵汇率创造竞争优势的旧政治反射充其量只能算是短期解决方案。
It will not eliminate the structural weaknesses of the countries in question.	它无法消除问题国家的结构性弱点。
The ECB is moving ever farther into uncharted territory.	欧洲央行正在朝着未知领域越走越远。
In view of the insufficient balance-sheet corrections in the private sector and inadequate structural reforms, macroeconomic demand-management tools will not work.	从私人部门资产负债表修正不充分和结构性改革不足的观点看，宏观经济需求管理工具是无效的。
Despite the ECB’s aggressive approach, monetary policy in the absence of structural economic reform risks being ineffective.	尽管欧洲央行采取了积极政策，但没有结构型经济改革，货币政策也可能毫无效果。
Simply put, more liquidity will not lead to more active bank lending until there is more transparency regarding the extent of non-performing loans and the relevant economies have become more flexible.	简言之，更多的流动性无法带来更活跃的银行贷款行为，除非不良贷款程度的透明度有所增加，并且相关经济体弹性变得更大。
The ECB’s asset quality review and bank stress tests are expected to bring some clarity to the first question.	欧洲央行的资产质量检查和银行压力测试有望澄清第一个问题。
Then, more lending will occur on acceptable terms – assuming that there is corresponding demand.	接着，就可以在可接受的条件上发生更多的贷款 — — 假设有相应需求的话。
But the uncertainty regarding the extent and pace of economic reforms remains.	但与经济改革程度和节奏有关的不确定性仍然存在。
The ECB’s recent decisions, with their focus on short-term effects, indicate that monetary policy is no longer targeted at the eurozone as a whole, but at its problem members.	欧洲央行最近的决定及其对短期影响的关注表明货币政策的目标已不再是欧元区整体，而是其问题成员国。
Ad hoc decisions have replaced a feasible and principled medium-term strategy.	临时决定取代了可行、审慎的中期战略。
The problems created by this approach will be compounded by the unavoidable conflicts of interest with monetary policy implied by the ECB’s assumption of its new financial-stability and banking-supervision roles.	欧洲央行认为它应该扮演新的金融稳定和银行监督者角色，据此采取的货币政策所带来的不可避免的利益冲突将让这一方针所造成的问题更加复杂。
The first casualty will most likely be price stability.	首当其冲者很有可能是价格稳定性。

Justice for Srebrenica’s Dead	带给斯雷布雷尼察死难者的正义
THE HAGUE – In 1993, atrocities committed against Slavic Muslims near the Bosnian silver-mining town of Srebrenica catalyzed demands to establish a tribunal to try political and military leaders accused of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia.	发自海牙 — — 在1993年，波黑塞族共和国军队侵入波斯尼亚银矿城市斯雷布雷尼察，并对当地斯拉夫族穆斯林所犯下了暴行，而这也引发人们要求建立特别法庭，审判相关军政领导人在前南斯拉夫地区所犯下的战争罪责。
The new United Nations tribunal that was formed – nearly five decades after the final judgments were rendered at Nuremberg and Tokyo – became the forerunner of ad hoc courts to prosecute perpetrators of Rwanda’s genocide, Charles Taylor and his blood-diamond butchers in Sierra Leone, and the Khmer Rouge killers in Cambodia.	而当时为此而新设的联合国特别法庭 — — 在纽伦堡和东京审判结束了近半个世纪之后 — — 也开创了先河，为随后审判卢旺达大屠杀，追究利比里亚前军事独裁者查尔斯·泰勒以及他那帮塞拉利昂滴血钻石屠夫，以及审判柬埔寨红色高棉屠杀者提供了示范。
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) also gave rise to the permanent International Criminal Court to try war criminals worldwide.	而这个前南斯拉夫问题国际刑事法庭（简称：前南法庭）同时也带动了常设国际刑事法庭的成立。
Undeterred by the still-untested ICTY’s reach, Serb soldiers finally overran Srebrenica itself – despite its status as a “safe area” under UN protection – 15 years ago, on July 11, 1995, and proceeded to expel the town’s people and execute 7,600 captives.	但当时在新生的前南法庭面前，塞族士兵却一意孤行，最终在15年之前的1995年7月11日蹂躏了整个斯雷布雷尼察 — — 尽管该地是受联合国保护的“安全区 ” — —并驱逐了该镇的居民，还处决了7600名俘虏。
Out of this massacre, however, the tribunal and foreign-backed war-crimes courts in Bosnia and Serbia have delivered the international justice effort’s most significant achievement to date.	而在这起大屠杀发生之后，特别法庭和外国在波斯尼亚和塞尔维亚设立的战争罪行法庭都成功地执掌了国际正义，这也是法庭迄今为止最重大的成就。
With no media fanfare and limited arrest and investigative powers, and despite the foreign-policy and military “realists” who dismiss international justice as a pipedream, these judicial institutions have brought justice to Srebrenica’s dead and their survivors, and have demonstrated that justice can be delivered to victims in other conflict areas.	尽管没有媒体的推波助澜，尽管只有有限的拒捕和调查权，尽管那些将国际正义视为白日做梦的外交和军事“现实主义者”们不断冷嘲热讽，这些司法机关依然给斯雷布雷尼察事件的殉难者和生还者带来了正义，并昭示出正义是可以被带给其它地区的受害者的。
It is an imperfect, unsatisfying justice, to be sure, but no more imperfect or unsatisfying than that dispensed by national courts.	虽然这种正义无疑算不上完美，也无法令人完全满意，像相对于那些国内法院的判决来说，已经足够完美，足够令人满意了。
The ICTY ruled the Srebrenica massacre to be an act of genocide.	前南法庭将斯雷布雷尼察大屠杀判定为种族灭绝罪行。
The tribunal and the local courts imprisoned 13 of those who gave the orders, as well as 17 execution-squad members; 11 more men, four of them leaders, are facing their reckoning.	法庭和地方法院将13名屠杀下令者以及17名屠杀小组的成员送入了大牢；另外还有11人，其中包括4名领导人，也陆续得到了应有的惩罚。
On trial now are Radovan Karadžić, the Bosnian Serb political leader, and Jovica Stanišić, the police minister in Slobodan Milošević’s Serbia.	目前还在受审的是波斯尼亚塞族领导人拉多万·卡拉季奇，还有约维卡·斯塔尼希奇，他可是斯洛博丹·米洛舍维奇领导下的塞尔维亚前国家安全部部长。
Of course, the Bosnian Serb commander, Ratko Mladić remains a fugitive.	当然，波斯尼亚塞族军事领导人拉特科·姆拉迪奇依然在逃。
But Serbia’s authorities, facing economic turmoil, cannot harbor him much longer if the United States and the European Union exert adequate pressure.	但如果美国和欧盟施加足够压力的话，身陷经济困境的塞尔维亚当局不可能包庇此人太久。
Serbia recently surrendered Mladić’s war-time diaries.	塞尔维亚最近还提交了姆拉迪奇的战时日记。
The Srebrenica trials also yielded a soul-testing record of a crime whose gravity Serb political leaders, former UN officials, and others once shamefully denied.	斯雷布雷尼察审判的另一个成果，则是提供了一份关于一项严重罪行的震撼人心的记录，而这项罪行是那些塞族领导人，前联合国官员和其他人曾无耻地否认过的。
Thanks to the ICTY, anyone can read the transcripts of intercepted calls to deliver more “packages” to the killing fields.	多亏有了前南法庭，人们可以看到那些要求“送更多‘包裹’到屠杀现场”的电话录音内容。
A Serb district president, Miroslav Deronjić, testified that Karadžić told him: “Miroslav, those people there must be killed.”	以及一位叫米洛斯拉夫·德容季奇的塞族地方官员的证词 — — 当时卡拉季奇跟他说 ： “ 米洛斯拉夫，这些人必须杀掉 。 ”
We know when, where, and to whom Mladić issued the kill order.	我们知道姆拉迪奇是在何时，何地以及向何人下达了屠杀命令。
The tribunal’s Web site has video of an execution.	前南法庭的网站上还存有记录当时屠杀过程的录像资料。
We know that a Serb truck driver rescued a boy who survived a firing squad and, crying for his father, crawled from a twisted scrum of bodies.	我们知道一个塞族卡车司机拯救了一个在处决中幸存，哭着找自己的爸爸，从死人堆中爬出来的小男孩。
We know that a Serb officer defied Mladić and refused to order his men to partake in mass murder.	我们知道一名塞族军官反抗姆拉迪奇的命令，拒绝命令他的士兵参加屠杀。
The ICTY is flawed, of course.	当然，前南法庭也是有缺陷的。
Judges and attorneys have treated too many witnesses with condescension, as if the tribunal were doing them a favor.	法官和律师经常以傲慢的姿态去对待那些屠杀的见证者，似乎法庭所做的事对他们的恩赐。
Judges have sentenced too many killers to absurdly lenient prison terms, diminishing any deterrent effect that the tribunal might generate.	法官们对大多的屠杀者都太过仁慈，没有从重判刑，削弱了法庭可能产生的巨大威慑力。
And they threw the book at one of Mladić’s men who pled guilty and gave damning insider testimony, eliminating the prosecution’s leverage to obtain similar admissions.	他们还严惩了一名认罪并提供了关键内幕证词的姆拉迪奇身边人，削弱了检察官获取类似证词的能力。
Prosecution officials also negligently incinerated personal effects of Srebrenica victims, as well as items discovered in Albania and other evidence, and then obfuscated to dodge a scandal.	检察官员同时还疏忽大意地销毁了斯雷布雷尼察受害者的随身物品以及在阿尔巴尼亚和其他地方发现的证物，后来又为了避免丑闻曝光，蓄意混淆视听。
New rules and procedures, as well as better training, can minimize such failings.	而新的规则和程序，以及更良好的训练都可以尽量减少这些失误。
But without the ICTY, impunity would have reigned for the murderers of Srebrenica and of less-renowned scenes of war crimes. Karadžić would still be flogging love potions in Belgrade.	但如果没有了前南法庭的话，斯雷布雷尼察以及其他更不为人知的战争罪行的凶手们就会逍遥法外，卡拉季奇这种人也依然会在贝尔格莱德作威作福。
The retired generals would be tanning beside the Adriatic.	而那些退休将领们则在亚得里亚海边悠闲地晒着太阳。
Overwhelming proof of Croatia’s complicity with Serbia in the dismemberment of Bosnia – something the media have also ignored – would never have emerged.	大量有关克罗地亚串通塞尔维亚分割波斯尼亚的证据 — — 有些是连媒体都忽略的 — — 也不会呈现在世人面前。
And, following this anniversary of the massacre, it is safe to say that, without international justice, all of Srebrenica’s victims – including my brother-in-law’s father, Huso Čelik, and the others who are still missing – would still be moldering anonymously in mass graves.	而在屠杀发生15周年纪念之际，我们可以肯定地说，没有国际正义，所有斯雷布雷尼察的受害者 — — 包括我连襟的父亲，胡梭·塞里克以及其他依然失踪的人 — — 依然只会是万人坑中的无名枯骨。
Their loved ones would be waiting still to gather at the town’s memorial cemetery, where, on this anniversary, they dropped to their knees, drew their hands over their eyes, and recited the funeral prayer to Allah for forgiveness of the living and the dead.	如今他们的亲人在该市的纪念公墓默默等待，在周年忌日之时，亲人们双膝下跪，双手掩面，背诵悼词，请求安拉宽恕这些活着和死去的人们。
	
Justice Is Reconciliation	和解就是正义
In South Africa, indeed around the world, we are raised on a strict diet of justice as retribution.	在南非，甚至整个世界，我们将伸张正义狭隘地理解为施以惩罚。
With violent crimes on a shocking upsurge, with the hideous crimes of child rape and abuse on the increase, there are nowadays frequent calls – backed by wide public support – to restore capital punishment.	随着暴力犯罪令人震惊地大幅度增加，随着骇人听闻的强奸和虐待儿童罪行变得日益恶化，如今恢复死刑的呼声常常充盈于耳，而且得到了公众的广泛支持。
Mercifully, South Africa’s Constitutional Court has ruled that the death penalty – which South Africans eliminated at the same time we were liberated from apartheid – is unconstitutional.	幸运的是，南非宪法法院已经裁定死刑不合乎宪法，这种刑罚在南非人民从种族隔离制度下解放出来的同时即被宣告废止。
Sadly, in many places in the world, it seems that men and women have not advanced beyond the biblical admonition of “an eye for an eye” in their yearning for retribution.	令人悲哀的是，世界很多地方的男男女女似乎并没有摆脱圣经中“以眼还眼”的训诫，他们渴望对犯罪行为施以惩罚。
Indeed, some Muslim countries amputate the hands of convicted thieves in public.	事实上在一些穆斯林国家，一旦法律认定盗窃罪名成立，窃贼甚至会被当众砍断双手。
But that biblical adage was in fact invoked originally to curb blood feuds from claiming the innocent relatives of the person who committed the killing.	但“以眼还眼”的圣经谚语实际本来意在防止凶手的亲属在家族复仇中无辜丧命。
“An eye for an eye” asks that the culprit should be the sole target, and not others, whose only crime was to be related to him.	“以眼还眼”要求只把犯罪者本人作为目标，而不要波及无辜，如果说那些无辜者有罪，那么他们唯一的过错就是与罪犯沾亲带故。
So the “eye for an eye” adage was not intended to mean what it has come to mean, namely that killing be paid for by another killing.	因此与最初相比 ， “ 以眼还眼”的含义已经发生了变化，变成了以杀戮来抗拒杀戮。
Given the brutality of the apartheid era, that would have never worked in my homeland.	种族隔离时期的残忍暴行使得这种做法永远也不可能在我的国家获得成功。
Some South Africans called for Nuremberg-type trials, especially for perpetrators of those atrocities that were designed to maintain the vicious apartheid system.	有些南非人要求举行纽伦堡那样的审判，特别要惩戒那些以维护邪恶的种族隔离制度为目的的施暴者。
There were demands that the guilty be brought to book.	有人提出要对这些罪行展开审判。
But we were fortunate in that Nuremberg was not really an option for us.	幸运的是，纽伦堡审判在南非根本行不通。
Nuremberg happened because the Allies inflicted unconditional surrender on the Nazis and so could impose a so-called victor’s justice.	纽伦堡审判的前提是盟军迫使纳粹无条件投降，然后才能推行所谓胜利者的正义。
In our case, neither the apartheid government nor the liberation movements could defeat each other. We had a military deadlock.	而在我们国内，无论种族隔离政府还是解放运动都无法彻底将对方打垮，于是形成了军事上的僵持局面。
Moreover, in the case of Nuremberg, the prosecutors and judges could pack up their bags after the trial and leave Germany for their several homes.	不仅如此，在纽伦堡案例中，原告和法官都可以在审判结束后收拾行囊，离开德意志回到他们自己的国度。
We had to make our homes in this, our common motherland, and learn to live with one another.	而我们的归宿却只能是这里，我们共同的祖国，因此我们必须学会和平共处。
Such trials would probably have gone on nearly forever, leaving gaping wounds open. It would have been difficult to procure the evidence to get convictions.	这样的审判几乎可以无休止地往复下去，使得战争留下的伤口永远鲜血淋漓、无法愈合。
We all know just how cunning bureaucrats can be in destroying incriminating evidence.	要想获得定罪的证据将非常困难，我们都知道那些官老爷们在销毁罪证方面有多么狡猾。
So it was a mercy that our country chose to go the way of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission – granting amnesty in exchange for the truth.	因此，我们的国家选择追随“真理与和解委员会”的确是件幸事，这意味着只要承认真理，就可以赦免过去犯下的罪过。
This was ultimately based on the principles of restorative justice and ubuntu.	这种做法的终极源泉是恢复性司法和“分享”原则。
At the TRC hearings we were exposed to gruesome details about atrocities that were committed to uphold or to oppose apartheid.	在“真理与和解委员会”举办的听政会上，我们听到了骇人听闻的杀戮细节，而这些杀戮的目的有些是为了维护种族隔离制度，有些是为了反对它。
“We gave him drugged coffee and shot him in the head and then we burned his body.	“我们让他喝下了含有麻醉成分的咖啡，对准他的头部开枪，然后焚烧了尸体。
As it takes 7 – 8 hours for a human body to burn, we had a braaivleis on the side, drinking beer and eating meat.”	因为人体需要7-8个小时才能烧成灰烬，我们就在燃烧的尸体边上开野餐会，吃烤肉、喝啤酒 。 ”
How low men can sink in our inhumanity!	人性竟然可以沉沦到如此的地步！
Each time such horrible stories were published, we had to remind ourselves that, yes indeed, the acts were demonic, but the perpetrators remained each a child of God.	每次这样的恐怖事件公诸于众，我们都不得不提醒自己：是的，这些罪行比魔鬼还要可怕，但它们的制造者却仍然是上帝的子孙。
A monster has no moral responsibility and so cannot be held accountable; but even more seriously, designating someone a monster closes the door to possible rehabilitation.	魔鬼没有任何道德义务，因此也根本不可能承担责任，而更重要的是，把某个人划定为魔鬼就彻底排除了改造的可能性。
Restorative justice and ubuntu are based firmly on the recognition of the fundamental humanity of even the worst possible offender.	承认最可怕的罪犯也有基本的人性是恢复性司法和“分享”原则赖以存在的坚实基础。
We cannot give up on anybody.	我们不能放弃对任何人进行拯救。
If it was true that people could not change, once a murderer always a murderer, then the whole TRC process would have been impossible.	如果人真的无法改变，一日杀人终身嗜血，那么“真理与和解委员会” 也就失去了存在的价值。
It happened because we believed that even the worst racist had the capacity to change.	这个组织之所以存在，就因为我们相信即使是最顽固的种族主义分子也存在改造的可能性。
And I think we in South Africa have not done badly; at least that is what the rest of the world seems to think of our transformation and the TRC process.	而且我认为南非在这方面做得不坏，至少世界其它国家对我们的改造与和解努力都比较认同。
Because an “eye for an eye” can never work when communities are in conflict – reprisal leads to a counter-reprisal in the sort of blood spiral we are seeing in the Middle East.	因为“以眼还眼”在战争中永远不会发挥作用，报复之后是反报复，会使我们陷入中东那样的血腥循环而无力自拔。
The type of justice South Africa practiced, what I call “restorative justice” is, unlike retribution, not basically concerned with punishment, it is not fundamentally punitive.	南非推行的正是我所谓的“恢复性司法 ” ， 它不同于报复，从本质上讲与惩戒无关。
It sets high store by healing.	它看重修复。
The offence has caused a breach in relations and this breach needs to be healed.	犯罪行为破坏了社会关系，这种破坏需要人为的修补。
It regards the offender as a person, as a subject with a sense of responsibility and a sense of shame, who needs to be reintegrated into the community and not ostracised.	它把罪犯当成人来看待，把他们当做有责任感、有廉耻心的主体，我们要做的是把他们重新纳入社会，而不是就此排斥在外。
There is a wealth of wisdom in the old ways of African society.	古老的非洲社会蕴藏着很多智慧。
Justice was a communal affair and society set a high store by social harmony and peace.	他们认为司法是一项公共事务，而社会看重的是融洽与和谐。
The belief was that a person is a person only through other persons, and a broken person needed to be helped to be healed .What the offence had disturbed should be restored, and the offender and the victim had to be helped to be reconciled.	他们相信人只有透过他人才能实现自我的完善，而破碎的人格需要别人的帮助才能够得以复原。 犯罪行为破坏的秩序需要得到恢复，而我们必须协助罪犯和受害者实现和解。
Justice as retribution often ignores the victim and the system is usually impersonal and cold.	惩罚性的司法常常忽视受��者的存在，这样的制度冰冷、缺乏人情。
Restorative justice is hopeful.	而恢复性的司法则充满了希望。
It believes that even the worst offender can become a better person.	它相信即便是最恶劣的罪犯也能向好的方面发展。
This does not mean being soft on crime.	这样做并不是对犯罪行为的姑息迁就。
Offenders must realize the seriousness of their offences by the kind of sentences they get, but there must be hope, hope that the offender can become a useful member of society, after paying the price they owe to society.	犯罪分子必须通过审判意识到自身行为的严重后果。 但我们同样不能放弃希望，要让罪犯在付出必要的代价后，重新成为社会中有用的一员。
When we act as if we really believe that someone can be better, is better, then they will often rise to our expectations.	如果我们本着信任的原则去为人处事，那么即使是犯罪分子也不会辜负我们的期望。
	
Biomedicine in Reverse	生物医学逆风飞扬
LA JOLLA, CALIFORNIA – Pundits have long predicted that biology would dominate the twenty-first century, just as physics dominated the twentieth century.	拉荷亚，加利福尼亚—权威人士早就预测，生物学将主宰二十一世纪，正如物理学主宰二十世纪。
But biomedical research has yet to achieve the kind of productivity increases that accompanied the industrialization of combustion, electricity, and electronics.	但生物医学研究并为实现与伴随燃烧、电力和电子的产业化所出现的那种生产率提升。
Will the “century of biology” turn out to be little more than a fantasy?	“生物学的世纪”最后会成为镜花水月吗？
The problem largely comes down to a decrease in biomedical research-and-development expenditure.	这一问题在很大程度上可以归结为生物医学研发支出的下降。
As it stands, roughly $270 billion is invested in the field each year, producing an impressive half-million research publications, but only 20-30 new medicines.	目前，该领域每年的投资规模大约为2,700亿美元，产生令人瞩目的五十万项发表成果，但只能带来20—30种新药。
The discrepancy between spending and output adheres to what has come to be known as “Eroom’s law” – Moore’s law in reverse.	支出和产出之间的矛盾符合所谓的“逆摩尔定律 ” 。
Moore’s law observes the increase in computer processing power over time – specifically, that the number of transistors that can be placed cheaply on an integrated circuit doubles every 18-24 months.	摩尔定律是关于计算机处理能随时间增长而变化的定律，具体而言，在一块集成电路上所能廉价布置的晶体管数量每18—24个月会翻一番。
By contrast, Eroom’s law charts the regress in new drug approvals, noting that the costs of developing a new medicine double roughly every nine years.	相反，逆摩尔定律是关于新药批准数量的，该定律指出，开发新药的成本大约每九年会翻一番。
This phenomenon is rooted in high rates of drug failure and lengthening technology cycles.	这一现象的根源在于药品失败率极高以及技术周期极长。
The probability that a drug entering clinical trials will gain approval from the US Food and Drug Administration has dropped from 23.9% in 1997 to 10.4% today.	进入临床试验的药品获得美国食品和药品监督局（Food and Drug Administration）批准的概率从1997年的23.9%下降至如今的10.4 % 。
While the first recombinant insulin in the 1980’s took less than a decade from testing to approval, monoclonal antibodies and gene therapy took more than 20 years to reach the same milestone.	20世纪80年代，第一个合成胰岛素花了不到十年的时间走完了从测试到批准的过程，但单株抗体和基因疗法却用了20多年才抵达了同样的目的地。
So far, pharmaceutical and biomedical research firms have responded to Eroom’s law by cutting R&D or moving it to less expensive sites in Asia, shifting their focus to less prevalent diseases, and sourcing innovation externally.	目前，药品和生物医学研究公司应对逆摩尔定律的办法是削减研发或将其转移至成本较低的亚洲、将研发焦点移向重要性较低的疾病，以及将创新外包了事。
As a result, growth in biomedical R&D spending has declined from more than 9% annually in the early 2000’s to less than 3% today.	结果，生物医学研发支出增长率从本世纪之处的年均9%下降到现在的不到3 % 。
But, while this strategy will moderate the impact of Eroom’s law, it will ultimately prove inadequate to sustain the industry.	但是，尽管这一战略缓和了逆摩尔定律的影响，但最终也无法维持整个行业。
The industry’s ability to support R&D budgets has already led to the closure of more than 30 major research sites.	医药业支持研发预算的能力下降已导致30多家大型研究机构关闭。
The United States bore the brunt of these closures, with biomedical R&D expenditure declining by more than $12 billion from 2007 to 2012.	美国是研究机构关闭的主要地区，从2007年到2012年，美国生物医学研发支出下降了120多亿美元。
And Asia – where biomedical R&D is growing rapidly, but from a small base – is unlikely to pick up the slack.	而亚洲的生物医学研发虽然增长很快，但基数很低，不可能填补空白。
Asian countries have tended to be reluctant to shoulder the cost of developing new medicines, with reimbursements falling far short of US levels, and their R&D productivity will not match that of the US and Europe for several more years.	亚洲国家一向不愿意承担开发新药的成本，新药研发回报远低于美国水平，研发生产率也比美国和欧洲落后多年。
Moreover, biomedical research firms are abandoning certain diseases in order to avoid the large-scale trials that they require, focusing instead on “orphan diseases” like cystic fibrosis, which demand smaller clinical trials that have a higher probability of success, leading to drugs that can cost more than $100,000 annually per patient.	此外，生物医学研究公司正在放弃某些疾病以免去这些疾病所要求的大规模试验，而专注于囊包性纤维症等“孤儿病 ” （ orphan diseases ） ， 这些疾病只需要较小规模的临床试验，成功概率更高，而由此产生的新药每年要花费每位病人100,000多美元。
But, with insurers and payers worldwide becoming increasingly vigilant about controlling costs, this business model’s long-term prospects are unclear.	但是，随着全球保险公司和支付人越来越关注成本控制，这一商业模式的长期前景并不乐观。
Finally, while drugs are increasingly produced by small companies that larger pharmaceutical firms then acquire, funding for these start-ups is drying up.	最后，尽管药品日益由小公司生产，获得成功后再由大型制药公司收购，但这些创业企业的资金源正在枯竭。
Likewise, universities – the main source of biomedical innovation – are facing dwindling budgets.	类似地，作为生物医学创新主要源泉的大学也在面临预算缩水问题。
This year, funding for the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) – one of the world’s leading medical research centers – is a billion dollars lower than in 2012.	今年，美国国家卫生研究所（National Institutes of Health，NIH，世界领先的医学研究中心）的资金比2012年减少了十亿美元。
Restoring funding for basic biomedical research appears to have lost favor with policymakers, because it does not offer immediate self-sustaining economic returns.	恢复对基础生物医学研究的拨款似乎并不受决策者待见，因为这无法立刻产生能自我维持的经济回报。
And funding for basic research remains a low priority in emerging economies like China, where it accounts for less than 15 cents for every research dollar spent (compared to 35 cents in the US).	而在中国等新兴经济体，基础研究拨款的优先等级也很低，并且每1美元的研究投入只能产生15美分（美国是35美分 ） 。
With no panacea in sight, several other solutions are gaining traction.	在看不见万灵丹的情况下，一些其他办法正在获得关注。
To maximize investment, the public and private sectors are increasingly pooling resources.	为了实现投资最大化，公私部门正在日益集中资源。
For example, under the Accelerating Medicines Partnership, the NIH and ten biopharmaceutical companies will fund a five-year effort to validate promising targets in three disease areas.	比如，在医学合作出金计划（Accelerating Medicines Partnership）中，NIH和十家生物制药公司将为一个五年计划提供资金，旨在在三种疾病领域实现承诺目标。
Other initiatives include efforts in Alzheimer’s research to test competing drugs against one shared “placebo arm” in clinical trials, and in cancer research to test multiple therapies in a single trial and identify the most responsive patients.	其他项目包括在阿尔兹海默症研究中检测不同药品在临床试验中对同一“安慰剂”的对比效果，以及在癌症研究的单一试验中测试多种疗法和识别反应最强的患者。
These pooled resources will be directed to a few high-priority diseases, identified through an evaluation of the marginal benefit of additional R&D. Japan’s focused strategy to champion stem-cell R&D should serve as a model for other countries.	这些���中起来的资源将被用于一些较紧迫的疾病，通过对研发增量的边际收益来评估。 日本集中资源推进干细胞研发的战略可以作为其他国家的榜样。
At the same time, governments will have to implement policies aimed at guiding investment toward specific diseases.	与此同时，政府必须实施旨在引导针对具体疾病的投资的政策。
For example, increased NIH funding, extended market exclusivity, and relaxed regulatory hurdles in the US resulted in a renaissance in antibiotic drug development.	比如，NIH拨款的增加、广阔的专属市场以及宽松的监管让美国的抗生素药物开发迎来了第二春。
Society will also have to share the cost of drug development.	社会也必须共同承担药品开发的成本。
Regulatory agencies worldwide may follow the United Kingdom’s lead in embracing adaptive licensing.	全球监管机构可以效仿英国的先例，实施适应性许可制度。
Under this approach, drugs are conditionally approved and marketed, with the revenue generated following the conditional approval covering the costly trial for proving efficacy.	根据这一办法，药品被有条件批准和上市，用有条件批准后所获得的收入覆盖昂贵的药效验证试验。
Such a scheme facilitates lower drug pricing, while overcoming the effect of Eroom’s law on investment in treatments for many diseases.	这一制度有助于降低药价，同时克服许多疾病治疗投资上逆摩尔定律。
Whether these efforts will succeed in putting biomedical research on a more sustainable footing remains an open question.	这些方法能否让生物医学研究走上更加可持续的道路仍未可知。
This could still turn out to be biology’s century.	本世纪或许仍然是生物学的世纪。
But it is not a sure thing.	但这绝不是百分百确定的事情。
	
Infrastructure’s Class of Its Own	基础设施应单独成一类
BEIJING – After several months of disappointing economic indicators, China’s State Council has unveiled a “mini-stimulus” package, focused on social-housing construction and railway expansion.	北京—近几个月来，中国的经济指标令人失望，中国国务院抛出了集中于社会保障房和铁路建设的“迷你刺激”计划。
The decision came a month after Premier Li Keqiang’s declaration that China had set its annual growth target at “around 7.5%” – the same as last year’s goal.	此前一个月，李克强总理宣布中国的年增长目标是“7.5%左右 ” ， 与去年持平。
The implication is clear: While consumption-driven growth remains a long-term goal for China, infrastructure will continue – at least in the short term – to serve as a key driver of China’s economy.	言下之意是明确的：尽管消费推动型增长仍是中国的长期目标，但基础设施 — — 至少在短期 — — 依然是中国经济的重要推动力。
Of course, China is not the only economy that depends on infrastructure investment to buttress economic growth.	当然，中国决非唯一一个依赖基础设施投资支持经济增长的经济体。
The World Bank estimates that infrastructure investments accounted for nearly half of the acceleration in Sub-Saharan Africa’s economic growth in 2001-2005.	世界银行估算，2001—2005年，基础设施投资贡献了撒哈拉以南非洲地区经济增长加速的近一半。
According to the Bank, a 10% increase in infrastructure investment is associated with GDP growth of 1%.	据世界银行的数据，基础设施投资增加10%将伴随GDP增长1 % 。
Such investment also creates jobs, both in the short term, by creating demand for materials and labor, and in the long term, for related services.	这笔投资还能创造就业 — — 从短期看，是通过创造对原材料和劳动力的需求；从长期看，是通过创造对相关服务的需求。
For example, every $100 million invested in rural road maintenance translates into an estimated 25,000-50,000 job opportunities.	比如，每1亿美元农村公路维持投���可以创造约25,000—50,000个就业机会。
But these benefits are diluted in China, owing to its excessive reliance on public funding.	但这些好处在中国被稀释了，因为中国过度依赖公共融资。
Indeed, in recent years, less than 0.03% of Chinese infrastructure investment – which amounted to roughly 9% of GDP – was derived from private capital.	事实上，在最近几年中，中国基础设施投资（约占GDP的9 % ） 中只有不到0.03%来自私人资本。
This problem is not limited to China; of the 7.2% of GDP that Asian countries spend, on average, on infrastructure development, only about 0.2% is privately funded.	这不仅仅是中国的问题；平均而言，亚洲国家将GDP的7.2%花在了基础设施开发上，其中只有0.2%为私人供资。
By contrast, in Latin America and the Caribbean, private capital finances, respectively, 1.9% and 1.6% of infrastructure investment.	相反，在拉丁美洲和加勒比地区，基础设施投资的私人资本融资比例分别为1.9%和1.6 % 。
Discussions within the G-20 have produced two possible explanations for Asian countries’ inability to attract more private capital to infrastructure projects.	二十国集团的内部讨论就亚洲国家无法吸引更多私人资本投向基础设施项目的问题提出了两个解释。
Most developing countries argue that the problem is rooted in the provision of capital, with investors preferring to fill their infrastructure portfolios with low-risk projects, and insurance companies and banks facing overly restrictive regulations.	大部分发展中国家认为问题的根源在于资本供给，投资者更喜欢投资低风险基础设施项目，而保险公司和银行业面临着过度严格的监管。
OECD countries like Germany counter that the problem is the lack of investment-worthy assets; there are simply not enough bankable projects available.	德国等经合组织国家反驳说问题在于缺少值得投资的资产；即这只不过是可获得银行可接受的项目太少的缘故。
In fact, both explanations are correct – but neither is complete.	事实上，两种解释都是正确的 — — 但都有失偏颇。
It is time for Asia’s leaders to recognize that the lack of private funding for infrastructure projects cannot be reduced to one or even two problems, and to develop comprehensive solutions that account for the full scope of the challenge.	亚洲领导人应该认识到，私人基础设施项目融资的缺乏不是一两个问题那么简单，他们应该寻找全面的解决方案彻底解决这一挑战。
This requires, first and foremost, abandoning the view that infrastructure assets fit into the paradigm of traditional asset classes like equity, debt, or real estate.	这首先需要抛弃一个观点，即基础设施资产可以按照股本、债务或不动产等传统资产类别范式归类。
Infrastructure must be redefined as a new asset class, based on several considerations.	基础设施必须重新定义为新的资产类别，有几个方面需要考虑。
For starters, there is the public-good element of many infrastructure projects, which demands contingent government obligations like universal coverage levels for basic services.	首先，许多基础设施项目包含公共品性质，这意味着或有政府义务，类似于基本服务的普遍覆盖。
In order to make such projects more appealing to private investors, economic externalities should be internalized, and a link should be established between the internal rate of return, which matters to a commercial investor, and the economic rate of return, which matters to society.	要让这类项目产生对私人投资者的吸引力，经济外部性就必须内部化，内在回报率（商业投资者所关心的问题）和经济回报率（社会所关心的问题）之间必须建立联系。
Moreover, innovative mechanisms to supply new assets to investors would be needed – and that requires the creativity found and priced by markets.	此外，需要向投资者提供新资产的创新机制 — — 而这需要市场来发现和定价创造力。
To this end, private-sector sponsors must be given space to initiate valuable projects.	在这方面，私人部门出资者必须获得发起有价值的项目的空间。
The new asset class would need its own standardized risk/return profile, accounting, for example, for the political risks that public-sector involvement may imply and for the lower returns from infrastructure relative to traditional private equity.	新资产类别需要有其自身的风险/回报特征，比如，需要考察公共部门参与所隐含的政治风险以及基础设施回报低于传统私人股权的风险。
Moreover, the risks associated with the new asset class would change as projects progress from feasibility study to construction to operation, implying that each phase would attract different sources of funding.	此外，与新资产类别伴随而生的风险会随着项目从可信性研究演进到建设和经营而变化，这意味着每一阶段吸引的资金源不同。
A clear understanding of this process would enable potential investors to assess projects more effectively, which is critical to encouraging them to put up financing.	清晰理解这一过程将使潜在投资者能够更有效地评估项目，而这是鼓励他们出钱的关键。
Another important consideration is the considerable technical expertise that infrastructure investments demand, which makes them more complex than most assets.	另一个重要的考虑点是基础设施投资需要大量专家知识，这使得它们比大部分资产更复杂。
Similarly, a specialized network of actors would be needed to ensure that intermediation of infrastructure transactions is efficient and cost-effective, instead of fragmented and slow, as it is now.	类似地，还需要行动方的专业化网络以确保基础设施交易中介效率高、成本低，而不是想现在那样分散且行动缓慢。
For countries that lack China’s strong fiscal position, the need to attract private capital to infrastructure investment is obvious.	对于财政状况不如中国的国家来说，吸引私人资本参与基础设施投资的需要是显而易见的。
With nearly 70% of Sub-Saharan Africa’s population lacking access to electricity and 65% of South Asians lacking access to basic sanitation, there is no greater imperative than to plan, fund, build, and maintain infrastructure assets.	撒哈拉以南非洲有70%人口无法得到电力，65%的南亚人没有基本卫生设施，规划、融资、建设和维护基础设施资产的需求极其迫切。
But private investment in infrastructure remains vital even in countries like China, because it brings the power and dynamism of the market, which improves the allocation of capital and promotes transparency.	但基础设施私人投资对于中国这样的国家也是至关重要的，因为它能带来市场的力量和活力，从而改善资本配置、增加透明度。
Indeed, more private-sector involvement would make the kind of scandals that have occurred in China’s railway sector far less likely.	事实上，更多私人部门的参与将让类似中国铁路部门腐败这样的丑闻可能性大幅下降。
In short, redefining infrastructure as a new asset class is the only credible way to attract funding for infrastructure construction, and thus to boost long-term economic growth and the employment rate.	简言之，将基础设施重新定义为新资产类别是吸引基础设施建设融资、从而提振长期经济增长和就业率的唯一可行的办法。
It is time for Asia’s leaders to step up.	亚洲领导人应该行动起来。
	
The West’s Other Trump	西方的另一个特朗普
BRUSSELS – In the second American presidential debate, Donald Trump promised that, if elected, he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton.	布鲁塞尔—在第二场美国总统竞选辩论中，唐纳德·特朗普承诺如果当选将任命一位特别检察官调查希拉里·克林顿。
“You’d be in jail,” Trump told her.	“你会进监狱的 ， ” 特朗普对她说。
Trump’s threat to politicize the justice system has received the backlash that it deserves; but, sadly, his cynicism is not unique to the United States.	特朗普的司法体系政治化威胁遭到了应有的口诛笔伐；但悲哀的是，他的犬儒主义并非美国所独有。
The current Polish government, led by the Law and Justice (PiS) party, which came to power just under a year ago, has displayed a similar authoritarian streak, flouting legal conventions to further its own ends.	现任波兰政府在掌权快一年的法律与正义党（PiS）的领导下，表现出类似的极权主义特征，通过践踏法律推行自己的目标。
PiS leader Jarosław Kaczyński has repeatedly called for an inquiry into former Polish Prime Minister and current European Council President Donald Tusk.	PiS领导人雅罗斯瓦夫·卡钦斯基多次要求调查前波兰总理、现任欧洲理事会主席唐纳德·图斯克。
Kaczyński holds Tusk’s former government partially responsible for the April 2010 plane crash in Smolensk, Russia, which killed 96, including Kaczyński’s twin brother, Polish President Lech Kaczyński.	卡钦斯基指责图斯克的前任政府要为2010年4月俄罗斯斯摩棱斯克坠机事件负有部分责任。 该事件导致96人死亡，包括卡钦斯基的双胞胎兄弟、波兰总统莱赫·卡钦斯基。
The Polish government delegation was traveling to a commemoration of the 1940 massacre in Katyn, where Stalin ordered the murder of 22,000 Polish army officers, police officers, and intelligentsia and blamed Hitler for the crime.	遇难的波兰政府代表团前往斯摩棱斯克参加1940年卡廷大屠杀纪念活动。 在卡廷大屠杀中，斯大林下令杀害了22,000名波兰军官、警官和知识分子，并栽赃给希特勒。
When the Cold War ended, the truth about the massacre finally came out, and was officially recognized by Russian President Boris Yeltsin.	冷战结束后，卡廷大屠杀真相大白，并由俄罗斯总统叶利钦予以正式承认。
Jarosław Kaczyński and other PiS members maintain that Russia – with help from some Polish officials – was responsible for the plane crash, too.	雅罗斯拉夫·卡钦斯基和其他PiS党员认为俄罗斯 — — 在一些波兰官员的帮助下 — — 也要为坠机事件负责。
They have relied on this bizarre conspiracy theory in their rise to power, despite having no evidence to support it.	他们依靠这个奇特的阴谋论上台，尽管根本没有证据支持他们的主张。
Indeed, transcripts from the plane’s recovered cockpit voice recorder indicate that the plane crashed during a bad-weather landing.	事实上，复原的飞机驾驶舱录音表明，飞机是在糟糕天气下着陆时坠毁。
Armed with his conspiracy theories, Kaczyński wants to deny Tusk a second term at the helm of one of the European Union’s three main governing institutions, saying, “Should such a person be at the head of the European Council?	卡钦斯基想借助阴谋论阻挠图斯克作为欧盟三大治理机构之一首脑的第二个任期，称“这样一个人可以担任欧洲理事会首脑吗？
I have profound doubts.”	我表示深切的怀疑 。 ”
Meanwhile, Poland’s right-wing media has fanned the flames, with one magazine recently depicting Tusk in handcuffs.	与此同时，波兰右翼媒体也在煽风点火，某杂志最近刊出图斯克戴手铐的漫画。
Kaczyński’s anti-Tusk crusade is a Trump-worthy abuse of political power that foreshadows what life would be like for Trump’s political opponents if he were actually to win.	卡钦斯基的反图斯克运动是特朗普式政治权力的滥用，它预示了如果特朗普真的当选，他的政治对手命运会如何。
It also reflects a broader, raging battle for Poland’s soul.	它也反映了更加宽泛和激烈的波兰心灵之战。
Poland was once Central Europe’s post-Cold War democratic poster child.	波兰曾经是中欧后冷战时代民主榜样。
But now the PiS is pursuing a wide-ranging power grab, seeking control of the country’s constitutional court, public media channels, and security services.	但如今，PiS正在追求权力一把抓，寻求控制波兰宪法法院、公共媒体频道和安全部门。
Instead of cementing Poland’s strategic importance to NATO and its rightful place as a powerful, respected EU member state, the PiS has become obsessed with reversing modernity.	PiS不去巩固波兰对北约的战略重要性，不去追求波兰作为受尊重的强大欧盟成员国的应有地位，而是沉迷于扭转现代性。
As proof, one need look no further than the government’s assault on its own judiciary and democratic institutions, which is raising eyebrows in the US, Brussels, and across Europe.	要想证实这一点，只需要看看政府对其自身司法和民主制度的抨击，这已经引起了美国、布鲁塞尔和整个欧洲的不满。
Poland is experiencing a constitutional crisis that began when PiS-backed Polish President Andrzej Duda refused to swear in three Constitutional Tribunal judges chosen by the previous parliament.	从PiS支持的波兰总统安德烈·杜巴拒绝在前任议会所选定的三位宪法法庭法官面前宣誓就职开始，波兰面临着一场宪政危机。
The PiS then selected its own judges instead, while adopting legislation that essentially paralyzed the court.	PiS随后用自己选择的法官替换之，同时实施了让宪法法庭基本瘫痪的立法。
The court declared the PiS’s judicial rule changes unconstitutional, but the PiS-led government refused to publish the court’s decision, thereby blocking it from taking effect.	宪法法庭宣布PiS的司法规则修订违宪，但PiS领导的政府拒绝公布法庭裁决，从而阻止了它的生效。
It is now all but impossible for the court to assess the constitutionality of the current parliament’s legislation, despite the Polish constitution’s explicit provision authorizing judicial review.	如今，宪法法庭根本无从评估本届议会立法的合宪性，尽管波兰宪法明文规定了授权司法审查。
Now that the PiS’s actions have been universally condemned, it is holding out until the end of the year, when the current constitutional court president’s mandate expires.	由于PiS的行为受到了一致谴责，这一问题将搁置直至年底现任宪法法庭主席任期届满。
After that, the PiS will appoint a friendlier president, who will no doubt dance to whatever tune it plays.	随后，PiS将任命一位更加友好的主席，毫无疑问，他将顺应PiS的要求。
But a newly appointed president likely won’t end Poland’s constitutional crisis, because with valid court judgments from this summer remaining unpublished, there is now a black hole in Poland’s constitutional order.	但新任命主席可能无法结束波兰的宪政危机，因为由于今年夏天的那宗有法律效力的裁决不公布，波兰宪政秩序中产生了一个黑洞。
The EU has started legal proceedings against Poland, and it is calling on the Polish government to work with opposition parties to reform the court.	欧盟已经开始针对波兰的法律程序，要求波兰政府与反对党合作改革宪法法院。
If Poland doesn’t comply, the EU could ultimately strip it of its voting rights.	如果波兰不服从，欧盟可能剥夺其投票权。
But it is unlikely that the EU or other international bodies will ensure a solution to the Polish political problem.	但欧盟或其他国际机构不可能保证找到波兰政治问题的解决办法。
Only Poles can do that.	只有波兰人可以。
In fact, huge protests against a recent bill that would have banned virtually all abortions (under penalty of imprisonment for up to five years) forced the government to back down and withdraw the proposed legislation.	事实上，反对一项新法案的大规模示威已经迫使波兰政府收回立法提案。 该法案将禁止几乎一切堕胎行为（堕胎行为将导致最多五年刑期的处罚 ） 。
This marked a victory for Polish women, and it suggests that Poland is more progressive than Kaczyński would like to believe.	这标志着波兰女性的胜利，并且表明波兰比卡钦斯基所认为的更加进步。
Still, while the government may have suffered one major public defeat, the PiS’s underlying ideological illiberalism remains intact.	但是，尽管波兰政府可能遭到重大公共挫折，作为PiS意识形态基础的反自由主义（illiberalism）仍然完好无损。
That means Polish civil-society advocates will have to fight many more battles in the coming months to contain and reverse the PiS’s lawlessness.	这意味着波兰公民社会支持者必须在未来几个月中进行更多斗争以阻止和扭转PiS对法律的漠视。
	
A Good German Idea for 2018	2018年的德国好概念
ATHENS – By 2016, almost all Europeans had realized that radical policy and institutional reforms were essential to revive the European project.	雅典—2016年，几乎所有欧洲人都认识到，要复兴欧洲工程，必须采取果断政策和制度改革。
Yet serious reform was impeded by the usual disagreement about what should be done – a dispute that Emmanuel Macron, France’s new president, once described as a “holy war” between German and French elites.	但深度改革遇到了常见的障碍 — — 对应该怎么做产生了分歧，法国新总统马克龙曾经将这一分歧称为德国和法国精英之间的“神圣战争 ” 。
The year just ended, highlighted by the election of a French president much to German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s liking, demonstrated that, ultimately, it does not really matter who rules in Berlin and in Paris, or how much they like each other.	在刚刚过去的一年里，法国选出了一位颇合德国总理默克尔胃口的总统，这表明，说到底，谁在柏林和巴黎主政，或者主政者彼此有多喜欢，其实都不重要。
The “holy war” persists, even if the missiles with which each side demolishes the other’s proposals are now wrapped in diplomatic velvet.	“神圣战争”在继续，虽然双方用来反驳对方的方案的导弹目前仍包裹着外交的天鹅绒。
At the heart of this Franco-German war is the clash between two Rs: the German commitment to rectitude versus the French penchant for redistribution.	这场法德战争的核心是两个R之间的碰撞：德国坚持要公正（rectitude ） ， 而法国则更想要再分配（redistribution ） 。
German officials greet every French government proposal by mentally computing its cost for German taxpayers.	德国官员表面欢迎每一项法国政府的方案，心里则在算计这给德国纳税人所带来的成本。
And, behind every German counter-proposal, French officials see a ploy to hide behind rules and regulations so that the German elites can have their cake and eat it.	而在每一份德国的针锋相对的方案背后，法国官员看到了一个藏在规则和监管背后的诡计，即德国精英能够分得一杯羹。
Europe’s continued slide into stagnation and disrepute is the natural outcome.	欧洲就在不断的分歧之间陷入了停滞，而名誉扫地只是自然而然的结果。
Perhaps the German insistence on rectitude is right, although not in a sense that German officials will necessarily appreciate.	也许德国坚持公正并不错，只不过未必是在德国官员所欣赏的意义上。
I could not, in good conscience, side credibly with any French, Italian, or Greek proponent of redistribution if their proposals violated the principles of rectitude.	凭良心说，我无法“无脑站边”任何法国、意大利或希腊所提出的再分配方案，如果这些方案有违公正原则的话。
Doing what is right is, surely, superior to doing what is wrong, but expedient.	做正确的事当然要比作错误但权宜的事更重要。
But then the question becomes: What is the right thing to do?	但是问题来了：什么是正确的事？
And how can we agree on any answer, given our different interests, dispositions, and cultural backgrounds?	在我们的利益、配置和文化背景各不相同的情况下，如何就某个答案形成一致？
One thing is certain: We will never find out what rectitude commands if we are driven solely by our “interests.”	有一点是确定的：如果我们只受我们的“利益”的驱使，那么我们永远无法理解公正的含义。
Europe’s impasse is largely due to a standoff between opposing desires, objectives, and concerns: German fears of Greco-Latin rule-bending will always trump French fears of German empire-building, and vice versa.	欧洲的僵局主要是因为截然相反的愿望、目标和关注点导致的：德国担心希腊-拉丁的规则扭曲永远甚于法国担心德国的帝国缔造，反之亦然。
But if prejudicial desires lead to a dead end, and fail to reveal the right course of action, where does the key to rectitude lie?	但如果存有偏见的愿望导致僵局，也无法揭示正确的行动，那么公正的关键又在于何处？
“We should all do our duty” – a very German reply – merely displaces the disagreement to another plane, where we interminably debate competing duties.	“我们都应该做好应尽之责 ” — —相当“德国”的回答 — — 这只不过是用一个分歧取代另一个分歧，互相的矛盾的职责之间同样存在无尽的扯皮。
All madmen in authority, after all, believed they were doing their duty.	毕竟，掌权的疯子们都相信他们在尽自己的职责。
So the question becomes: “How can I know what my duty entails?”	于是问题变成了 ： “ 我如何知道我的职责包含哪些 ？ ”
A theist answer is equally unacceptable, given the monstrous crimes carried out by zealots convinced they were fulfilling their divine duty.	一神论的答案同样是不可接受的，因为认定自己在履行神赐责任的狂热分子犯下过滔天罪行。
The best answer I have come across is German: Immanuel Kant’s, to be precise.	我所见过的最佳答案是德国的：准确的说，是康德的。
For Kant, who struggled to re-define ethics in a new era of market societies, our duty can and must be deduced from our capacity for rationality.	康德苦心积虑想要在市场社会的新时代重新定义伦理，对他来说，我们的职责可以，也必须从我们的理性能力中衍生。
Unlike personal tastes, which are fickle and offer no sure path to happiness or virtue, duties can be discerned by a logical mechanism common to all humans.	和个人品味不同 — — 个人品味可以轻易改变，无法提供通往快乐或美德之路 — — 职责可以通过所有人类所共有的逻辑机制领会。
To be rational means more than being able to deploy your means efficiently in order to achieve your ends.	理性意味着你不仅仅能为了实现自己的目标而使用手段。
All sorts of animals are good at matching available means to given ends.	对于给定的目标，所有动物都擅长用可用的手段来与之匹配。
But humans are unique, Kant insists, because, unlike cats and dogs, we can pass rational judgment on our desires.	但人类是独特的，康德说，因为和猫狗不同，我们能够对我们的愿望进行道德评判。
We can ask ourselves, “I like X, but should I?”	我们可以扪心自问 ， “ 我喜欢X，但这应该吗 ？ ”
And we can say, “It is my duty to do Y, even though Y will probably lead to outcomes I dislike, given my expectations of what others will do.”	我们也可以说 ， “ 基于我对其他人会怎么做的预期，我有责任做Y，尽管Y有可能导致我不喜欢的结果 。 ”
But if the mark of a rational person is a capacity to act on reasons transcending cost-benefit analysis, how can our rational duty be deduced impartially, free of the influence of personal interests or prejudices?	但如果理性人的标志是基于超越成本-收益分析的理由来行动的能力，我们如何来不偏不倚地推演我们的理性指责，而不受个人利益或偏见的影响？
Kant offers a famous example: Language is what distinguishes us from other species; without it, we are mere beasts.	康德提出了一个著名的例子：语言是区分我们和其他物种的关键；没有语言，我们就只是野兽。
While lying often pays, if we all lied all the time, language would become obsolete.	尽管说谎常常会带来好处，但如果我们总是说谎，语言就会成为障碍。
Rational humans, Kant concludes, must recognize that they have a duty to abstain from a practice (lying) that, if adopted by everyone at once, would annul our most precious invention (language).	理性人，康德推论说，必须认识到他们有责任克制某种行为（说谎 ） ， 如果每个人都做出这种行为的话，将会让我们最宝贵的发明（语言）作废。
No god is necessary, no moralizing is required, to demonstrate our duty to tell the truth.	这里不需要上帝也不需要道德化来说明我们说真话的职责。
Practical reasoning is all it takes: A world where everyone lies is one in which human rationality, which depends entirely on language, dies.	实践理性足矣：在所有人都说谎的世界，完全取决于语言的人类理性将被杀死。
So it is our rational duty to tell the truth, regardless of the benefits lying might bring in practice.	因此，说真话是我们的理性职责，不管在实际中说谎会带来多少收益。
Applied to market societies, Kant’s idea yields fascinating conclusions.	应用于市场社会，康德的概念会产生一些极好的结论。
Strategic reductions in price to undercut a competitor pass the test of rational duty (as long as prices do not fall below costs).	策略性降价以破坏竞争对手能通过理性职责测试（只要价格不下降到成本线以下 ） 。
After all, producing maximum quantities at minimum prices is the holy grail of any economy.	毕竟，以最低价格生产最大数量是一切经济的圣杯。
But strategic reductions of wages to ever lower levels (the Uberization of society) cannot be rational, because the result would be a catastrophic collapse, owing to disappearing aggregate demand.	但策略性地不断降低工资 — — 社会的优步化（Ubersization ） — —则必然是非理性的，因为其结果将是总需求消失进而导致灾难性崩盘。
Turning to Europe, Kant’s principle implies important duties for governments and polities.	回到欧洲。 康德的原则暗示了政府和政策的重要职责。
And Germany and France would be held to be in dereliction of their duties to a functioning Europe.	德国和法国应该因为对它们让欧洲正常运转的指责玩忽职守而受到谴责。
If Germany’s current-account surpluses, currently running at 9% of GDP, were universalized, with every member state’s government, private sector, and households net savers, the euro would shoot through the roof, destroying most of Europe’s manufacturing.	如果德国的经常项目盈余 — — 目前占GDP的9 % — —平摊到各个成员国政府、私人部门和家庭净储蓄者头上的话，欧盟将会一飞冲天，破坏欧洲制造业大部。
Equally, universalized Greco-Latin deficits would turn Europe into a basket case.	同样地，将希腊-拉丁债务平摊的话，欧洲也将陷入瘫痪。
The trick, and our rational duty, is to embrace policies and to build institutions that are consistent with balanced trade and financial flows.	诀窍，以及我们的理性职责，在于制定政策、建设机构，使之与平衡贸易和金融流相一致。
Put differently, authentic German rectitude cannot be achieved without a form of redistribution that is bound to clash with the interests of, say, a French or a Greek oligarchy too lazy to come to terms with its own unsustainability.	换言之，如果没有势必导致（比如）与懒得解决自身的不可持续问题的法国或希腊寡头的利益冲突的再分配的话，真正的德国式公正也无从实现。
A critic of this German idea for reforming Europe might credibly ask why anyone should do their rational duty, rather than remain on the time-honored path of narrow self-interest?	这一德国式欧洲改革思维的批评者可能会不无道理地问，为何人们应该履行他们的理性职责，而不在经受时间考验的狭隘自利的老路上一直走下去？
The only sound answer is: because there is no truly rational alternative.	唯一可靠的答案是：因为这不是真正的理性方案。
Or, rather, the alternatives are all cant.	或者，其他方案都是伪善的。
	
The Fertility Conundrum	生育难题
BOSTON – It is perhaps inevitable that contraception and population growth are controversial topics, given the many perspectives brought to bear on them.	波士顿 — — 鉴于认识的角度多种多样，避孕和人口增长不可避免地会成为争议话题。
Reproductive-health activists focus on family planning and a woman’s right to control her own body.	生殖健康活动人士关注计划生育和妇女控制身体的权利。
Economists look at the impact on sustainable growth.	经济学家关注对可持续发展的影响。
Governments fret about over-population and unemployment.	政府则担心人口泛滥和失业问题。
Health workers worry about sexually transmitted diseases and malnutrition.	医务人员担心营养不良和性传播疾病。
Striking the right balance among these different viewpoints is no easy task – but much depends on getting it right.	在不同的诉求之间实现恰到好处的平衡绝非易事 — — 但上述目标能否实现却在很多领域具有决定性意义。
New contraceptive technologies – in the form of condoms, pills, and implantable devices – provide reversible and permanent forms of protection.	避孕套、避孕药和植入器械等全新避孕技术提供了可逆及永久形式的生殖保护。
But their usage varies widely – from just 4.8% of young women in Chad to 84.6% in China – reflecting differences in cost, availability, and cultural norms.	但具体使用状况差异很大 — — 从乍得年轻女性的4.8%到中国青年女性的84.6 % — —反映出不同国家在成本、使用便捷度和文化规范方面的差异。
Contraception indisputably brings health and socioeconomic benefits.	避孕无疑会带来健康和社会经济效益。
A 2012 study reported that its use averted an estimated 272,040 maternal deaths in 2008, 44% fewer than might otherwise have occurred.	2012年的一份研究报告显示避孕措施仅在2008年估计就避免了272,040例产妇死亡，比不采取避孕措施的情况要低44 % 。
Contraception use has also helped less developed economies by raising women’s employment and earnings potential.	避孕措施的使用还通过提高女性就业及收入能力帮助了欠发达经济体。
But perhaps one of the most important economic effects of contraception concerns the “dependency ratio” – the proportion of available workers to pensioners, children, and the infirm.	但或许避孕最重要的经济影响涉及“抚养比率 ” — —也就是现有劳动力与养老金领取者、儿童和体弱者的比率。
Lowering the birth rate lowers the overall dependency ratio – though at the risk of future labor shortages, weaker consumer spending, and reduced productivity.	降低生育率一般会降低总抚养率 — — 进而有可能造成未来劳动力短缺、消费力和生产力下降。
And, as more people live longer, and the relative size of the working-age population falls, the dependency ratio can begin to rise, with serious socioeconomic repercussions, because older people require more health care and draw pensions.	而且人口寿命增加造成劳动年龄人口相对规模下降及抚养率攀升，并因为老年人需要领取养老金和获取更多医疗保健服务，因而造成严重的社会经济后果。
On the other hand, rapid population growth as a result of higher birth rates can threaten the wellbeing of the poorest communities and countries, by altering the dependency ratio at the other end of the scale.	另一方面，出生率高所导致的人口快速增长通过改变天平另一端的抚养比率，可能威胁到最贫困群体和国家的福祉。
Sub-Saharan Africa and the world’s other poorest regions have recorded significantly more than 2% annual population growth in recent years, whereas the demographic trend in the advanced economies of Europe and Asia has been flat or declining	撒哈拉以南非洲地区和世界其他最贫困地区近年来已经实现超过2%的年人口增长，而欧洲和亚洲先进经济体的人口基本呈平稳或下降趋势。
Simulations indicate that the optimal average number of children born to a woman over her lifetime is around 2.3.	模拟计算显示女性一生的最佳平均产子数约为2.3个。
This is the total fertility rate (TFR) required to maintain current population levels (the replacement rate).	这是维持目前人口水平（替代率）所需的总生育率（TFR ） 。
Unfortunately, few countries strike the right balance, with country averages ranging from 6.9 (in Niger) to 0.8 (in Singapore).	遗憾的是，鲜有国家能恰到好处地实现平衡，各国的平均产子数从尼日尔的6.9人到新加坡的0.8人波动很大。
The CIA World Factbook reports that 141 countries (approximately half of the world’s population) fall below the replacement rate, with population decline projected in some cases to reach 20% by 2050.	美国中情局世界概况报告显示有141个国家（约占一半的世界人口）处于替代率以下，某些情况下截止2050年的人口下降预计将达到20 % 。
Some countries, such as Germany and France, are trying to raise their TFR to the replacement level.	有些国家，比方说德国和法国，正努力将总生育率提高到与替代率相等。
Others are struggling to bring down their TFR, because of fears about future mass unemployment and social unrest.	还有些国家因为担心未来大规模失业和社会动荡而努力降低总生育率。
In all cases, economic circumstances and social pressures will dictate the level and speed of population growth.	无论如何，经济环境和社会压力将决定人口增长的水平和速度。
That is why much attention has focused on the impact of a growing global population on food demand.	这解释了人们为什么极为关注世界人口不断增长对粮食需求的影响问题。
A rising population has been associated with starvation and malnutrition in some parts of the world.	人口增长在某些国家一直与饥饿和营养不良息息相关。
Until recently, the global population was predicted to surpass 11 billion by 2050, triggering Malthusian fears.	不久前尚有预测显示全球人口到2050年将超过110亿，而这激起了马尔��斯主义者的忧虑。
Thanks in part to lower fertility rates in industrialized countries, this projection has been adjusted downward, to about 8.9 billion.	幸亏工业化国家生育率较低，该预测数据已向下调整至约89亿。
But such fears remain.	但依然存在这样的忧虑。
The risk is that policymakers and campaigners will conflate the problems of food shortages and starvation with that of population management and its long-term social and economic consequences.	危险在于决策者及活动家把粮食短缺与饥饿问题和人口管理及其长期社会经济影响混淆在一起。
In fact, according to a forecast in 2002 by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), global food production will exceed the needs of the global population by the year 2030, largely owing to the Green Revolution of the past half-century.	事实上，联合国粮农组织（FAO）2002年的一份预测显示全球粮食产量到2030年将超过全球人口需求，这在很大程度上是因为过去半个世纪的绿色革命提高了粮食生产能力。
Arguably, the causes of food shortages are to be found in the organization, distribution, and waste of resources, not population growth.	可以说，是组织、分配和资源浪费，而不是人口增长造成了粮食的短缺。
The United Kingdom’s Institution of Mechanical Engineers estimated in 2013 that 1.2-2 billion tons of food (30-50% of total food production) is wasted annually.	英国机械工程师学会估计2013年每年浪费约12-20亿吨的粮食（相当于粮食总产量的30-50 % ） 。
This far exceeds the 230 million tons of food produced in Sub-Saharan Africa.	这一数字远远超过了撒哈拉以南非洲地区生产的2.3亿吨粮食。
At the same time, the FAO estimates that 870 million people worldwide – 90% of them living in developing countries – suffer chronic undernourishment.	与此同时，粮农组织估计全球8.7亿人 — — 其中90%生活在发展中国家 — — 受困于慢性营养不良症。
Furthermore, approximately half of the 10.9 million children who die each year do so as a result of poor nutrition, while more than 1.4 billion adults and 40 million children are overweight or obese.	此外，每年死亡的1，090万儿童中约半数是因为营养不良，而超过14亿成人和4，000万儿童却为超重或肥胖所困。
None of this should divert attention from the need to achieve a balance between population growth, appropriate dependency ratios for countries at different stages of economic development, and the fight for women’s reproductive rights.	这一切均不应将注意力从实现人口增长平衡、在不同经济发展阶段的国家维持恰当的抚养率和为女性生殖权利做斗争中转移开去。
These are long-term issues that require international cooperation and collaborative research.	这些都是需要国际合作和共同研究的长期问题。
Indeed, like climate change, population balance is a global issue that must be addressed carefully and rigorously – and before it is too late.	事实上，就像气候变化一样，人口平衡也是要赶在为时已晚之前认真严肃解决的世界性问题。
	
Disrupting Putin’s Game Plan	干扰普京的游戏计划
MUNICH – No sooner did the Sochi Winter Games end than Russia bade farewell to the Olympic spirit by invading and occupying a foreign country.	慕尼黑—索契冬奥会一结束，俄罗斯就和奥林匹克精神分道扬镳了 — — 它入侵并占领了外国。
With its aggression against Ukraine, the Kremlin has breached the United Nations Charter, the Helsinki Final Act, and other international agreements, including the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances and the Black Sea basing agreement, which spelled out Russia’s relations with Ukraine.	对乌克兰的侵犯触犯了联合国宪章、赫尔辛基最后议定书（Helsinki Final Act）和其他国际协定，包括确定俄罗斯与乌克兰关系的布达佩斯安全保证备忘录（Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances）和黑海基地协定。
Crimea has been turned into a military zone, and its inhabitants might soon find themselves trapped in the firing line if the crisis continues to escalate.	克里米亚已经变成了军事区，如果危机继续发酵，其居民或许很快就会陷入战场。
Russians now face international diplomatic and economic isolation, thus exacerbating their country’s economic woes.	如今，俄罗斯面临着国际外交和经济孤立，这进一步加剧了俄罗斯的经济混乱。
And Russian President Vladimir Putin’s reckless gamble risks dragging the world into a wider conflict.	而俄罗斯普京的孤注一掷可能把世界拖入更大的冲突。
In light of Putin’s dangerous behavior, the West must rethink its stance toward him.	面对普京的危险行动，西方必须反思对普京的立场。
Here is a leader who read a hidden, menacing agenda into a technical European Union document about export subsidies and anti-fraud provisions.	这位领导人把技术性的关于出口补贴和反欺诈条款的���盟文件解读成隐蔽的威胁论。
More broadly, here is a paranoiac who sees an implausible coalition of liberal Russians, Ukrainian fascists, the CIA, and Islamist terrorists trying to thwart his preferences, if not topple him, at every turn.	更广义地说，他是一位偏执狂，认为自由派俄罗斯人、乌克兰法西斯主义者、CIA和伊斯兰极端分子组成了一个不可思议的联盟，在一切事务上都要和他对着干，甚至试图推翻他。
Indeed, what we are seeing is not an unfortunate over-reaction to recent events, but a result of meticulous preparation.	事实上，我们看到的不是对最新事件的不幸的过度反应，而是精心准备的结果。
Armies do not mobilize 150,000 troops within days, or have vehicles and thousands of uniforms without insignias ready, or hold military exercises in peaceful regions of the world without warning.	否则军队不可能在几天内动员150,000大军，不可能准备好大量汽车和数千名身穿无标识制服的部队，也不可能在没有警告信号的和平地区举行军演。
It would be a mistake for NATO to respond to Russia’s provocations with similar saber rattling.	如果北约对俄罗斯的挑衅以牙还牙，那将是一个错误。
After all, the United States and the EU still have a range of tools to modify Putin’s calculus, or that of those bankrolling his regime.	毕竟，美国和欧盟有很多办法可以改变普京的算盘，或者影响普京政权的收入。
Most important, the US and Europe must cooperate much more closely than they have so far.	最重要的是，美国和欧洲必须比现在更加紧密地合作。
The impression of disunity on sanctions plays into Putin’s hands.	在制裁问题上莫衷一是，得利的是普京。
Some EU members, like Germany, must live up to the expectations they have recently raised.	一些欧盟成员国，比如德国，决不能辜负人们对他们的新近预期。
If German leaders are serious about instituting a “culture of responsibility,” they are obliged to act accordingly, even if doing so entails economic costs.	如果德国领导人所谓树立“责任文化”是认真的，那么他们就有义务据此行动起来，即便这样做会到来经济代价。
The West should also listen carefully to Ukraine’s neighbor, Poland, which probably has the deepest insight into the complexities of the crisis.	西方也必须认真聆听乌克兰的邻国波兰的声音，波兰也许是对这场危机的复杂性洞见最深刻的国家。
Most important, it is essential to adhere to certain key principles:	最重要的是，必须坚守几条关键原则：
Use diplomacy.	利用外交。
Europe, the US, and Japan have already suspended their cooperation with Russia in the G-8.	欧洲、美国和日本已经叫停了与俄罗斯的G-8合作。
Similarly, the OECD should put Russia’s accession process on hold.	类似地，经合组织也把接受俄罗斯的进程冻结了。
Following punitive measures by the US, the EU has now decided on some “soft” sanctions.	跟随美国的惩罚措施，眼下欧洲已决定采取一些“软”制裁。
But modest steps like suspending talks on visa liberalization will not impress the Kremlin much.	但中止签证自由化这样的温和步骤并不会让克里姆林宫感冒。
Stronger signals, such as cancellation or suspension of agreements concerning the South Stream gas pipeline and a trade embargo on arms and dual-use items, merit serious consideration.	更强的信号 — — 比如取消或中止南溪（South Stream）输气管道协议、武器贸易禁令或者双管齐下的选择应该得到认真考虑。
Impose targeted sanctions against those responsible for Russia’s Crimean incursion.	对俄罗斯入侵克里米亚的责任人实施定向制裁。
An obvious tool here is to broaden the US Magnitsky Act, which prohibits the 18 people identified as being directly responsible for the detention, abuse, and death of the Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky from entering the US or using its financial system.	在这方面，一个现成的工具是扩大美国马格尼茨基法（Magnitsky Act）的范围。 马格尼茨基法禁止18位被认定对俄罗斯律师谢尔盖·马格尼茨基的被捕、虐待和死亡负有直接责任的人员禁止进入美国和使用美国的金融服务。
The Magnitsky Act should be amended to include the names of political and military leaders responsible for the invasion of Ukraine.	马格尼茨基法应该做出修订，将应该对入侵乌克兰负责的政治和军事领导人纳入其中。
Moreover, the modified bill should be adopted by the US and the EU simultaneously – thus delivering a credible threat to freeze the foreign assets of Russia’s government, state-owned companies, individual officials, and relevant oligarchs.	此外，修正后的法案应该在美国和欧盟同时获得通过 — — 从而构成可信的冻结俄罗斯政府、国有公司、个别官员和相关寡头的海外资产的威胁。
Engage Russians.	将俄罗斯纳入进来。
The West needs to communicate to ordinary Russians the spuriousness of Putin’s zero-sum, us-versus-them narrative.	西方需要和普通俄罗斯人交流，揭开普京你死我亡的零和博弈论的虚伪。
Closer relations between Ukraine and the EU pose no threat to Russia; on the contrary, a Ukraine closely integrated with its Western neighbors could boost Russia’s economy as well.	乌克兰和欧盟走得更近决不是对俄罗斯的威胁，相反，与西方邻国紧密一体化的乌克兰能够提振俄罗斯的经济。
That may be irrelevant to a leader who is guided by visions of restored imperial glory, but not to the people under his rule.	对于一位着眼于重塑帝国荣光的领导人来说，这或许无关紧要，但对受他统治的人民来说并非如此。
Knocking holes in the Kremlin’s wall of propaganda will not be easy, but it should not be impossible in our hyper-connected world.	在克里姆林宫的宣传机器上寻找破绽决非易事，但在我们的高度互联的世界也并非不可能的任务。
Support Ukraine with financial aid – as the EU has now done –and by securing its upcoming elections.	用金融援助 — — 如欧盟现在所做的那样 — — 和保证即将到来的选举支持乌克兰。
Military assistance should include, at a minimum, Western intelligence sharing and cooperation through the NATO-Ukraine Commission.	军事援助也应该最低限度地包括进来，西方应该与乌克兰共享情报，并通过北约-乌克兰委员会（NATO-Ukraine Commission）展开合作。
Should the situation deteriorate further, the West should also provide medical aid and surveillance assets.	如果局势进一步恶化，西方还应该提供医疗援助和监控设备。
If the 2008 Russo-Georgian war is any guide, NATO’s Cyber Defense Center should help Ukraine prepare for a large-scale digital offensive.	2008年拉索-格鲁吉亚战争的前车之鉴表明，北约的网络防务中心应该帮助乌克兰做好准备抵抗大规模数字攻击。
Defend NATO allies.	捍卫北约盟国。
NATO should discuss concrete steps to protect its members.	北约必须讨论采取保护其成员国的具体步骤。
Ukraine borders four NATO members (Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania), while a fifth (Turkey), along with Romania, borders the Black Sea.	乌克兰与四个北约成员国接壤（波兰、斯洛伐克、匈牙利和罗马尼亚 ） ， 更与和俄罗斯接壤的第五国（土耳其）共享黑海沿岸。
Moreover, Estonia and Latvia are alarmed at Russia’s geopolitical ambitions, especially given the pretext of protecting ethnic kin.	此外，爱沙尼亚和拉脱维亚也对俄罗斯的地缘政治野心引起了警惕，特别是考虑到俄罗斯保护同族人民的借口的情况下。
Both have populations that are about 25% Russian – a legacy of their Soviet past.	两国都有约25%的俄罗斯族人口，这是苏联时代的遗留问题。
Finally, Poland and Lithuania border Kaliningrad, Russia’s exclave in the middle of Europe (and the scene of its most recent combat-readiness exercise).	最后，波兰和立陶宛都和俄罗斯的中欧飞地（及其最近的备战行动地）加里宁格勒接壤。
This is a time for diplomacy, and NATO must try to avoid direct confrontation, but not at all costs.	这是一个外交时机，北约必须试图避免直接冲突，但也不能不惜代价。
It must reckon that Russia’s actions might deliberately run counter to a peaceful settlement.	北约必须认识到，俄罗斯的行动可能是有意地与和平解决方案渐行渐远。
The alliance cannot afford to launch a lengthy and heated debate about the deployment of its forces and capabilities only at the moment diplomatic efforts fail.	北约决不能等到外交手段失败才开始热烈讨论部署它的力量和能力。
When Ukrainians stood up against their corrupt elite, they became the first people to put their lives on the line for the goal of EU membership.	当乌克兰人站起来反对他们的腐败精英时，他们已成为第一批把他们的生命和欧盟成员国目标系在一起的人。
The result was unwarranted retaliation from Russia.	结果，他们招致了俄罗斯毫无理由的打击报复。
So this is not Ukraine’s war.	因此这不是乌克兰的战争。
Ukraine is the immediate victim, but it is by no means Putin’s ultimate target.	乌克兰是首当其冲的受害者，但这决不是普京的最终目标。
This is a blatant attack on the principles of state sovereignty, inviolability of negotiated borders, and adherence to multilateral agreements that underpin today’s rule-based international system.	这是对国家主权原则、议定边界的神圣不可侵犯性以及对作为当今世界基于规则的国际体系的基础的多边协定的赤裸裸的攻击。
Countering Russia’s aggression is thus the responsibility of all who would uphold that system.	因此，制衡俄罗斯的恣睢行为是所有赞成这一体系的人的责任。
	
How Money is Made	如何创造货币
BERLIN/SOUTHAMPTON – Last month, the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) announced the establishment of their own development bank, which would reduce their dependence on the Western-dominated, dollar-focused World Bank and International Monetary Fund.	柏林/南安普顿—上个月，金砖国家（巴西、俄罗斯、印度、中国和南非）宣布成立它们自己的开发银行，该银行可以减少它们对西方主导的、以美元为核心的世界银行和国际货币基金组织（IMF）的依赖。
These economies will benefit from increased monetary-policy agency and flexibility.	这些经济体将从货币政策中介（agency）和弹性增加中获益。
But they should not discount the valuable lessons offered by advanced-country central banks’ recent monetary-policy innovation.	但它们不能低估发达国家央行最近的货币政策干预所提供的重要教训。
In June, the European Central Bank, following the example set by the Bank of England in 2012, identified “bank credit for the real economy” as a new policy goal.	6月，欧洲央行效仿英格兰银行2012年的做法，将“面向实体经济的银行信用”作为新的政策目标。
A couple of weeks later, the Bank of England announced the introduction of a form of credit guidance to limit the amount of credit being used for property-asset transactions.	几周后，英格兰银行宣布引入一种形式的信用指引以限制用于房地产资产交易的信用。
Before the financial crisis hit in 2008, all of these policies would have been disparaged as unwarranted interventions in financial markets.	2008年金融危机爆发前，所有这些政策都被视为毫无根据的金融市场干预。
Indeed, in 2005, when one of us (Werner) recommended such policies to prevent “recurring banking crises,” he faced vehement criticism.	事实上，2005年，当本���作者之一（沃纳）建议采取这些政策以防止“银行危机重现”时，他遭到了猛烈的批评。
This March, however, the Bank of England acknowledged the observation that he and others had made – that, by extending credit, banks actually create 97% of the money supply.	但是，今年3月，英格兰银行承认了他和其他人所做的观察 — — 通过扩张信用，银行实际创造了97%的货币供给。
Given that a dollar in new bank loans increases the money supply by a dollar, banks are not financial intermediaries; they are money creators.	一美元银行贷款可以增加一美元货币供给，因此，银行并非金融中介（intermediary ） ； 而是货币创造者。
The growing recognition of banks’ true function will be a game-changer in areas like monetary policy and financial regulation, enabling officials to tackle effectively problems like recurring banking crises, unemployment, and underdevelopment.	对银行真正功能的逐渐认识将是货币政策和金融监管等领域的局面改变因素，官员因此得以有效处理银行危机重现、失业和发展不足等问题。
But it will take time to be fully accepted – not least because it challenges a fundamental tenet of traditional economics.	但这一点被完全接受需要时间 — — 因为它挑战了传统经济学的一个基本信条。
Indeed, according to this new paradigm, savings, while useful, are not an essential prerequisite to investment and thus to economic growth.	事实上，根据这一新范式，储蓄尽管有用，并非投资的先决条件，因此也不是经济增长的先决条件。
The United States, which experienced a prolonged period of growth without savings, is a case in point.	在无储蓄条件下经历了长期增长的美国就是明证。
In general, economic growth depends on an increasing number of transactions and an increasing amount of money to finance them.	总体而言，经济增长依赖于交易数量的增加和用于交易融资的货币数量的增加。
Banks provide that finance by extending more credit, the impact of which depends on who receives it.	银行通过扩张信用提供融资，而其影响取决于谁得到融资。
Bank credit for GDP transactions affects nominal GDP, while bank credit for investment in the production of goods and services delivers non-inflationary growth.	用于GDP交易的信用影响名义GDP，用于商品和服务生产投资的银行信用带来无通胀增长。
The problem lies in bank credit-for-asset transactions, which often generate boom-bust cycles.	问题出在银行资产信用（credit-for-asset）交易，这类交易常常引起枯荣循环。
By extending too much of this type of credit, banks pump up asset prices to unsustainable levels.	这类银行信用的过度扩张导致资产价格上升到不可持续的水平。
When credit inevitably slows, prices collapse.	当信用不可避免地放缓时，价格就崩盘了。
As the late-coming speculators go bankrupt, the share of non-performing loans on banks’ balance sheets rises, forcing banks to reduce credit further.	迟来的投机者纷纷破产，银行负债表的不良贷款比例也随之上升，迫使银行进一步缩减信用。
It takes only a 10% decline in banks’ asset values to bankrupt the banking system.	只要银行资产价值下降10 % ， 就可以让整个银行系统破产。
With an understanding of this process, policymakers can take steps to avert future banking crises and resolve post-crisis recessions more effectively.	理解了这一过程，决策者就可以采取行动以更有效地避免未来银行危机和解决后危机衰退。
For starters, they should restrict bank credit for transactions that do not contribute to GDP.	首先，他们应该限制用于无益于GDP的交易的银行信用。
Moreover, in the event of a crisis, central banks should purchase non-performing assets from banks at face value, completely restoring banks’ balance sheets, in exchange for an obligation to submit to credit monitoring.	此外，在出现危机时，央行应该以面值向银行收购不良资产，彻底重塑银行资产负债表，并以银行接受信用监控为交换条件。
Given that no new money would be injected into the rest of the economy, this process – which the US Federal Reserve undertook in 2008 – would not generate inflation.	由于没有新货币会注入经济的其余部分，这一过程 — — 正如2008年美联储所采取的 — — 不会引起通胀。
In order to stimulate productive bank credit – and boost the effectiveness of fiscal policy – governments should stop issuing bonds, and instead borrow from banks through loan contracts, often available at lower rates than bond yields.	为了刺激生产性银行信用 — — 并提振财政政策的效果 — — 政府应该停止发行债券，而应该通过贷款契约向银行借钱，这样做的利率往往会比债券收益率低。
This would bolster bank credit and stimulate demand, employment, GDP, and tax revenues.	这将提振银行信用并刺激需求、就业、GDP和税收收入。
Finally, a network of small not-for-profit local banks should be established to provide universal banking services, and loans to small and medium-size firms, like the scheme that has underpinned Germany’s economic strength and resilience over the last 200 years.	最后，应该建立小型非盈利地方银行网络以提供普惠银行服务以及中小企业贷款，如在过去200年中成为德国经济坚挺和坚韧基础的制度。
Beyond making the banking sector more robust, such an initiative would boost job creation per dollar in bank credit.	这一做法不但能够让银行部门更加强健，也能提高单位美元银行信用所创造的就业岗位数量。
Of course, large multinational banks, which have long benefited from the perception that economies need savings, are likely to resist such reforms.	当然，从经济需要储蓄的观念中长期获益的大型跨国银行可能会抵制这样的改革。
For decades, these banks have been selling “foreign savings” to developing countries by lending at high interest rates and in a foreign currency, fueling the accumulation of massive amounts of foreign debt, which would often be converted into equity.	几十年来，这些银行都在通过高利率外币贷款将“外国储蓄”卖给发展中国家，助长了外债（往往会被转换为股权）的大幅积累。
In other words, they issued credit that contributed little to the local economy, and then drained local resources through interest and exploding foreign currency-denominated debt.	换句话说，它们发行的信用对地方经济几乎毫无用处，随后又通过利息和爆炸式增长的外币计价债务榨干地方资源。
Just as the BRICS have rejected Western-led economic institutions, developing economies would do well to expel foreign banks and allow local financial institutions to create money for productive purposes.	正如金砖银行拒绝西方主导的经济机构，发展中经济体可以很好地驱逐外国银行并允许地方金融机构为生产性目的创造货币。
After all, successful economic development – in countries like the US, Germany, Japan, and China – has depended on domestic credit creation for productive investment.	毕竟，成功的经济发展 — — 如美国、德国、日本和中国 — — 取决于为生产性投资而创造的国内信用。
During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Michael Unterguggenberger, the mayor of the Tyrolean town of Wörgl, performed an experiment.	20世纪30年代大萧条期间，沃格尔（Wörgl）提洛尔镇（Tyrolean）镇长迈克尔·温特古根伯格（Michael Unterguggenberger）做了一个实验。
In order to reduce unemployment and complete much-needed public-works projects, he hired workers and paid them with “work receipts” that could be used to pay local taxes.	为了降低失业、完成急需的公共设施工程，他聘用工人，并用可用于抵付本地税的“工作券”支付工资。
With the local authority effectively issuing money for work performed, the local economy boomed.	这实际上等于是地方当局有效地为完成的工作发行货币，地方经济也因此繁荣。
The central bank, however, was not pleased, and decided to assert its monopoly over currency issuance, forcing Unterguggenberger to scrap the local public money and causing Wörgl to fall back into depression.	但是，央行很不高兴，并决定捍卫其对货币发行的垄断，强迫温特古根伯格废除地方公共货币，而沃格尔也再次陷入萧条。
Some 80 years later, the English city of Hull has begun to implement a similar scheme, using a digital crypto-currency that is, so far, not prohibited by law.	80年后，英国赫尔市（Hull）开始实施类似的计划，启用了一种目前未被法律禁止的数字型秘密货币。
The unfettered creation of money by large private banks has generated overwhelming instability, undermining the fundamental principle that money creation should serve the public good.	大型私人银行自由创造货币产生过不可挽回的动荡，破坏了货币创造必须符合公共利益这一基本原则。
This does not have to be the case.	这并非放之四海而皆准。
By implementing safeguards that ensure that credit serves productive and public purposes, policymakers can achieve debt-free, stable, and sustainable economic growth.	通过实施确保信用服务于生产性和公共目的的保护措施，决策者可以实现无债务的稳定而可持续的经济增长。
	
Merkel’s American Minders	默克尔的美国看守
BERLIN – Germans used to joke that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s penchant for communicating via fleeting text messages effectively marked the end of traditional historiography.	柏林—德国人曾经打趣说，总理默克尔爱用短消息沟通的习惯实际上标志着传统历史的终结。
Well, at least American spy agencies seem to have kept full track of the behind-the-scenes communications – in Berlin and beyond.	呃，至少美国间谍机构似乎全程跟踪着柏林和其他地方的幕后通信。
Regrettably, US President Barack Obama and his administration have yet to comprehend the scale and severity of the damage caused to America’s credibility among its European allies.	遗憾的是，美国总统奥巴马及其政府仍未能理解这给美国在其欧洲盟友中间的信誉所造成的伤害的广度和严重度。
The problem is not that countries spy on each other (they all do). Rather, it is the extent of US intelligence gathering and America’s attitude toward allies that is most damaging.	问题不在于各国彼此案中监视（所有国家都这么做 ） ， 而在于美国搜集情报做法的程度和美国对盟友的态度，这才是最危险的。
Previous transatlantic clashes over diverse issues such as climate change, the detainees at Guantánamo Bay, and the Iraq War exposed a breakdown of mutual understanding, sometimes stemming from sharp differences over how best to achieve certain common objectives.	此前，大西洋两岸在气候变化、关塔那摩监狱囚犯和伊拉克战争等诸多问题上的分歧暴露了互相理解方面的裂痕，有时候，分歧来自关于如何达到某些共同目标这一问题上的尖锐不同。
But the wiretapping crisis and other troubling revelations from the former American intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden point to a deeper problem: a crisis of mutual distrust that risks becoming a serious transatlantic rift at a time when closer political, economic, and security cooperation between Europe and the United States is needed more than ever.	但窃听危机和前美国情报承包商斯诺登所揭露的其他丑闻指向一个更深层次的问题：互相信任危机。 目前正是欧洲和美国之间最需要更紧密地进行政治，经济和安全合作的时候，互相信任危机有可能导致大西洋两岸的严重决裂。
There is probably nothing more destructive to friendly relations among democratic states than behavior by an ally that causes the other side to lose face at home.	对于民主国家之间的友好关系来说，也许没有比盟友让另一方在国内丢脸更具破坏性的了。
After all, it was Merkel who tried to calm the waters after the NSA scandal first hit Europe this summer.	毕竟，今年夏天美国国安局丑闻冲击欧洲时，默克尔还试图息事宁人。
That is why the alleged US wiretapping of her cellphone is so damaging for her, both personally and politically.	正因如此，美国被指窃听其手机令她十分受伤，不管从个人角度还是政治角度都是如此。
As someone who served in Merkel’s government from 2009 to 2011, I must admit that I was rather careless in the use of mobile communication devices while in office.	2009—2011年间，我在默克尔政府供职，必须承认，在此期间我对移动通信的使用并不太当心。
In principle, of course, one should always assume that foreign intelligence services attempt to listen in on other governments’ conversations.	当然，从原则上说，你应该时刻假定外国情报机构试图窃听他国政府的对话。
But it makes a big difference whether such activities are conducted by Russia or China, or by an ally that repeatedly emphasizes the importance of close transatlantic friendship and cooperation.	但这样的行为来自俄罗斯和中国，还是来自一再强调跨大西洋紧密友好和合作关系的盟友，其中的差别是巨大的。
Obama’s personality makes matters more complicated.	奥巴马的个性让事情进一步复杂了。
It is hard to recall any other US president who has been so personally disconnected from other heads of state.	很难想起还有哪位美国总统个性与其他国家首脑如此不同。
Instead of immediately reaching out to a friendly country, he decided to lie low and send White House Press Secretary Jay Carney to issue a rather awkward statement that the US government “is not” and “will not” monitor Merkel’s communications.	事发后，奥巴马并未立刻与友邦取得联系，而决定采取低调免事的态度，派白宫新闻秘书卡尼（Jay Carney）发布了一份蹩脚生命，说美国政府“没有”也“不会”监控默克尔的通信。
Of course, it does not take much interpretive skill to recognize a clumsy attempt to avoid confessing that US intelligence services targeted Merkel in the past.	当然，不需要深入挖掘就能看出，这番对于避免承认美国情报机构过去以默克尔为目标的说辞十分牵强。
The Obama administration appears to have failed to ask itself some basic questions.	奥巴马政府似乎应该扪心自问几个基本问题。
How could it justify spying on a leader who is among America’s closest allies in NATO and in the Afghanistan mission – a leader whom he invited to the Rose Garden to bestow the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest honor that America can give to a foreigner?	监视作为美国在北约和阿富汗任务中最紧密的盟友之一、被奥巴马邀请前往玫瑰花园授予美国对外国人的最高褒奖 — — 总统自由勋章的领导人，这如何说得过去？
Moreover, Merkel was not the only target.	此外，默克尔并非唯一的目标。
In the case of France, how could the Obama administration justify targeting an ally that has tried hard to build trust with the US by providing much-needed military and political cover in Libya and Syria?	就法国而言，奥巴马政府将目标对准通过向利比亚和叙利亚输送急需的军事和政治资源大力建设与美国的信任的盟友，这如何说得过去？
French President François Hollande, too, must feel like a fool – not just as a result of US surveillance, but also because he probably received no advance warning from his intelligence services about Obama’s sudden decision to ask Congress to pass a resolution prior to using military force in Syria.	法国总统奥朗德也一定感到自己被愚弄了 — — 不仅仅是因为美国的监控，也因为对于奥巴马的突然决定要求国会在向叙利亚动武之前批准议案，法国情报机构没有提前向他发出预警。
Finally, how can Obama explain to the EU (whose delegation in Washington, DC, was also bugged) that it is crucially important to enter into honest, serious, and comprehensive negotiations to conclude a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership?	最后，奥巴马如何向欧盟解释，为了完成跨大西洋贸易和投资合作伙伴关系（TTIP ） ， 展开诚信、严肃和全面的谈判是至关重要的（欧盟代表团在华盛顿的驻地也被监听了 ） ？
Prominent voices in Europe – including the president of the European Parliament and the leader of Germany’s Social Democrats (who is about to form a coalition government with Merkel) – are already demanding a suspension of the TTIP talks.	欧洲要人 — — 包括欧洲议会主席和德国社民党（马上将与默克尔组建联合政府 ） — —纷纷发声，要求中止TTIP对话。
The potential economic cost of a delay or a failure to achieve closer transatlantic economic integration could total hundreds of billions of dollars – in addition to the incalculable damage done to America’s credibility in Europe.	延迟或不能实现跟紧密的跨大西洋经济一体化有可能带来数千亿美元的代价，除此之外也将给美国在欧信誉造成不可估量的伤害。
There is much talk today about the risks of a new era of American isolationism and a lack of US leadership in the world.	如今人们大谈美国孤立主义和世界缺少美国领导的时期的风险。
It is important to remember that isolationism can be triggered not only by a potential retreat from global affairs, but also by the rather imprudent use of America’s hard and soft power on the world stage.	很重要的一点是要记住，触发孤立主义的不仅可以是从国际事务中的退出，也可以是在国际舞台上滥用美国的软硬实力。
To escape the NSA mess, various options will be discussed.	为了挽救美国国安局带来的混乱，人们讨论了各种方法。
The new Franco-German push for an intelligence-sharing agreement with the US is probably difficult to put into practice, especially considering that spy services operating around the world are not always fully controllable.	法国和德国新提出的与美国共享情报的协议可能很难成为现实，特别是在考虑到全世界间谍活动的操作并不总是完全可控的情况下。
As a first step, Obama must rediscover the great communications skills that propelled him to the White House in the first place.	作为第一部，奥巴马必须重新拿出让他入主白宫的高超沟通技巧。
From a public-diplomacy perspective, his handling of the surveillance scandal has been a complete failure.	从公共外交角度看，他对监控丑闻的处理是一场彻头彻尾的失败。
To contain the damage and begin to rebuild much-needed trust, Obama must issue a credible apology to Merkel, other Western allies, and their citizens.	为了遏制损失并开始重建急需的信任，奥巴马必须向默克尔、其他西方盟友以及这些国家的公民做出可信的道歉。
In the American political context, issuing an apology, especially to foreign governments, is often viewed as a sign of weakness.	从美国政治环境看，做出道歉，特别是向外国政府的道歉，通常被看作软弱的信号。
In the case of the NSA scandal, an unequivocal apology by Obama is the only viable solution to leave the past behind and move forward.	在美国国安局丑闻中，由奥巴马做出明确道歉是告别过去、重新前进的唯一可行办法。
Unfortunately, the window of opportunity for such a gesture to be viewed in Europe as a much-awaited olive branch – and a sign of real American strength and conviction – is closing fast.	不幸的是，摆出这一姿态、让欧洲看到期待已久的橄榄枝 — — 以及美国真正强大和令人信服的信号 — — 的机会窗口正在快速关闭。
	
America’s Debt-Ceiling Debacle	美国的债务上限乱局
NEW YORK – When Greece’s sovereign-debt crisis threatened the euro’s survival, US officials called their European counterparts to express bewilderment at their inability to resolve the issue.	发自纽约 — — 当希腊主权债务危机威胁到了欧元的生存之时，美国官员致电欧洲方面以表达对后者无力解决这一事件的困惑。
Now, the tables have turned, with American leaders on the receiving end of such calls.	如今反过来是美国领导人接到了这样的电话。
The most recent threat of a US debt default has been avoided, but only temporarily. Another battle looms early next year, when the US government’s debt ceiling will have to be raised again.	虽然最近一次美国债务违约的威胁警报已经解除，但这仅仅是暂时而已，因为另一场斗争将在明年年初美国政府债务上限必须再次调高时爆发。
In Europe, the absence of a political union – considered a necessary precondition for sharing debt obligations and, thus, putting the euro on a sound footing – is widely held to lie at the root of the continent’s crisis.	在欧洲，危机的根源来自于一个单一政治联盟的缺位，因为这是分担债务并以此将欧元构筑在一个合理基础之上的必要前提。
But the US crisis suggests that political union is no panacea for managing sovereign debt.	但美国的危机则表明政治联盟并不是根治危机的一副灵丹妙药。
For weeks, Republicans in the House of Representatives threatened to keep the government shuttered – thereby preventing it from extending its borrowing authority beyond the October 17 deadline – in order to challenge laws that were enacted by Congress as a whole and upheld by the Supreme Court.	数周以来，众议院的共和党议员威胁要让政府继续停摆下去 — — 因此政府也无法在10月17日的到期日之后延长其借款授权 — — 以挑战由国会大多数通过并得到最高法院支持的相关法律。
In the eurozone, the main source of disagreement has been how debts in need of refinancing were incurred – that is, whether they contravened agreed debt limits.	在欧元区，反对的声音主要来自这些需要重新筹钱偿还的债务是如何产生的 — — 也就是说，它们是否与议定的债务上限相抵触。
In the United States, the bone of contention has been the purpose that the funds will serve.	在美国，斗争的核心则是这些资金究竟将用在何种用途。
The difference is ultimately minor, and should not be allowed to overshadow what is really at stake: democratic self-governance in an age of high public debt.	两者的区别其实归根究底也不大，而且也都不应该掩盖了真正的危机：在一个高公共负债时代下的民主自我治理问题。
In 1773, the so-called Sons of Liberty staged the Boston Tea Party under the slogan, “No taxation without representation.”	1773年，一群所谓“自由之子 ” （ Sons of Liberty）在波士顿倾茶事件中喊出了这样一句口号 ： “ 无代表，不纳税 。 ”
And America’s founders clearly regarded legislative control over the budget as a key pillar of democratic governance.	而美国的建立者们也很清楚地认定对预算的立法管制是民主治理的一大关键支柱。
Taxation remains the dominant source of government revenue in most developed countries.	在大多数发达国，税款依然是政府收入的主要来源。
But the role of debt finance has been growing – and, with it, the need to refinance old debt when total expenditure, including debt service, exceeds total revenue.	但债务融资所扮演的角色也在不断扩大 — — 而随着该项目的发展，当政府总支出（包括征税行为）超出总收入时为旧债务重新融资的需求也不断扩大。
Broad access to deep and liquid international debt markets has enabled policymakers to bypass some of the most challenging aspects of democratic governance.	通往大规模高流动性国际债务市场的广阔渠道使得政策制定者们得以绕过某些最具挑战性的民主治理问题。
Rather than tackle thorny questions about how to allocate limited resources, democratic governments seem to believe that they can have it all: low taxes and ample debt finance to fund wars or electorate-pleasing programs.	比起处理那些关于如何分配有限资源的棘手问题，民主政府似乎觉得自己可以独占全部好处：一面维持低税率，一面依赖充足的债务融资来发动战争或者推动社会项目取悦选民。
Growing debt burdens suggest that this form of cheap politics has run its course.	但不断增大的债务负担表明这种形式的廉价政治已经走到了尽头。
But the problem runs deeper than that.	然而问题也比这严重得多。
Excessive reliance on debt finance has undermined basic tenets of democracy, with government finance increasingly determined not by electoral cycles and political deliberation, but by repayment schedules.	过度依赖债务融资已经腐蚀了民主的基本原则，因为政府财政逐渐由还债时间表所决定，而非取决于选举周期和政治决策。
In times of economic growth, debt finance provides an easy escape from difficult choices. When the economy falters, however, creditors – and those who are willing to entertain the prospect of default – can impose their will on everyone else.	在经济增长时债务融资可以让人轻易逃避那些艰难选择，一旦经济出了问题，债主们 — — 以及那些在违约预期中得利的人 — — 就可以把自己的意愿强加在任何人身上。
This power follows from the nature of debt.	这个力量来自于债务的本质。
A tax is a quasi-equity claim of the government on its citizens’ financial expectations.	税款是政府对其公民财政预期的准权益要求。
Gaining the consent of the majority of citizens to raise taxes can be a tall order politically, and has become more difficult as capital mobility has narrowed the tax base and triggered a race to the bottom on rates.	在提税方面获得大多数公民的共识在政治上是极难办到的事，并随着资本流动缩小了税基并引发各国政府争相降低税率而变得越来越困难。
Debt, by contrast, is a contractual commitment to repay creditors who are largely oblivious to how the money is spent.	相比之下，债务是一个答应偿还的契约承诺，但债主们大多都不知道这些钱都花到哪里去了。
By incurring debt, states trade an element of sovereignty – the flexibility to alter course over time in response to the electorate’s demands – for the ability to fund expenditures without being compelled to navigate the political minefield of raising taxes.	通过发债，国家放弃了主权的其中一个部分 — — 为回应选民需求而随时间调整政策进程的灵活性，换来了不用被迫踏入征税这个政治雷区而又能维持支出的能力。
Creating viable institutions for managing public debt in a democracy is difficult.	在一个民主政体中创设切实可行的体系去管理公共负债是相当困难的。
The mechanisms currently on offer are treaty-based, constitutional, and statutory debt ceilings, pegged as a ratio of GDP, or, as in the US, established in nominal terms.	目前提供的机制是一个以协议为基础，符合宪法的法定债务上限，以GDP的特定比率为限，或者像美国那样基于名义条款。
Treaty-based debt ceilings are largely toothless, as Europe’s experience suggests.	欧洲的经验表明，以协议为基础的债务上限基本上没什么强制力。
Constitutional debt limits have yet to be tested in times of emergency, when new funding is needed quickly.	宪法规定的债务上限还需要等到迫切需要新资金的危急时刻才能检验。
And, as the recent impasse in the US demonstrates, political minorities with effective veto power can abuse statutory ceilings in an economic downturn, when dependence on external debt finance increases.	而正如美国最近这次僵局所体现的那样，在对外部债务融资的需要增加的情况下，拥有有效否决权的政治上少数派可以在经济不景时滥用法定债务上限。
Indeed, to the extent that reliance on debt finance undermines self-governance, debt-ceiling abuse for partisan gain becomes more likely.	事实上，在债务融资腐蚀自我管治的方面，为党派利益而滥用债务上限的行为变得越来越常见。
The problem is that democracies have yet to learn how to manage debt effectively.	问题在于民主体制还未找到有效管理债务的方法。
While political union may stabilize the euro, it will not sustain or strengthen democracy unless Europe’s leaders address this critical failing.	虽然政治联盟或许可以稳定欧元，但除非欧洲领导人们能够解决这一重大缺陷，否则就无法维持和加强民主制度。
Even the world’s oldest continuous democracy is not immune to the erosion of self-governance.	即使世界上存续时间最长的古老民主制度也无法避免自我管治的腐蚀。
Commitments never to raise taxes have left the US dependent on debt finance – and, more frightening, on those who are ready to veto refinancing it.	永不加税的承诺导致美国只能依赖债务融资 — — 更可怕是的是，依赖于那些时刻准备否决再融资的人。
	
Central Banking’s New Club Class	央行的新俱乐部阶层
NEW YORK – In the wake of the 2007-2008 financial crisis, the world’s central banks played a critical role in rescuing the global financial system.	纽约—2007—2008年金融危机爆发时，全球央行在捍卫全球金融系统方面起到了关键作用。
They stepped in when private markets froze, acting as lenders and dealers of last resort, and provided additional liquidity to grease the wheels of finance.	它们在私人市场冻结时出手干预，承担了最后贷款人和最后交易人的角色，并提供了额外的流动性润滑金融之轮。
These central banks offered their services primarily to domestic actors, but they also extended their largess to foreign private entities.	这些央行主要为国内行为人提供服务，但它们的慷慨也惠及了外国私人实体。
Indeed, even foreign states benefited after central banks entered into swap agreements, giving one another unlimited access to their respective currencies.	事实上，就连外国也从央行的互换安排中得到了好处。 货币安排使其范围的各国可以无限制地获得各自的货币。
This has created a worrying precedent.	这开启了令人担心的先例。
Originally created as a temporary fix in 2007, the swap lines established at that time connecting the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank have been extended each time a new crisis has unsettled the markets.	始于2007年的互换安排最初是临时性措施，在美联储、欧洲央行和瑞士国民银行间建立了联系，但每逢新危机动摇市场，这一安排就会扩大一次。
More recently, however, six central banks announced that they had made their swap lines permanent.	但是，最近六大央行宣布将把互换安排永久化。
But did these central banks have the legal authority to do so?	但这些央行有法定权力这样做吗？
And, even if they did, should they have used it?	如果有，它们应该如何使用这一权力？
The original swap lines might fairly be classified as emergency measures.	最初的互换安排应该被归于紧急措施。
But what may be permissible and justifiable in a financial emergency may not be appropriate as standard practice during normal times.	但在金融紧急状态中可许可行的措施未必适合成为正常时期的标准行为。
Central bankers might argue that we have entered a state of permanent market crisis analogous to the never-ending “war on terror.”	央行行长可能会说，我们进入了持久市场危机状态，类似于永无止境的“反恐战争 ” 。
But even this frightening analogy does not answer the question of whether central banks should assume positions of power in international relations.	但即使是这一耸人听闻的类比也没有回答央行是否应该效仿国际关系中的实力结构的问题。
Of course, a central bank’s mandate is price stability in the national economy that it serves, and price stability is influenced by exchange rates.	当然，央行的使命是所在国国民经济的价格稳定，而价格稳定受汇率的影响。
So a case can be made that central banks should have the power to intervene in foreign-exchange markets, and that this power should – at least in times of crisis – include commitments to foreign central banks to provide unlimited liquidity in the domestic currency.	因此央行应该有权力干预外汇市场的看法不无道理，并且这一权力应该 — — 至少在危机时期应该 — — 包括向外国央行承诺无限制供应本币流动性。
What is less clear, though, is whether the same justification can be used by central banks to create permanent swap lines with just a few other central banks of their choosing.	但是，并不如此明确的是同样的论证是否适用于央行与一小撮由它们选定的其他央行建立永久的互换通道。
This is akin to an announcement on a cruise ship approaching an iceberg that the crew will definitely rescue first-class passengers but not necessarily others.	这就好比是在邮轮撞向冰山时宣布肯定会救助一等舱乘客，其他乘客就听天由命吧。
Not every country’s central bank – not even every “friendly” country’s central bank – has been invited to join the swap-lines club.	并不是所有国家的央行 — — 甚至不是所有“友好”国家的央行 — — 都被邀请进入这一互换俱乐部。
Membership is restricted to the United States Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Swiss National Bank, and the Bank of Canada.	其成员只限于美联储、英格兰银行、欧洲央行、日本银行、瑞士国民银行和加拿大银行。
There may be a legal rationale for this neo-imperial elitism.	这一新帝国主义精英论或许有其法律上的合理性。
The so-called C-6 might argue that, given their price-stability mandate, only central banks of countries whose economic fate might destabilize domestic prices should receive privileged access to domestic currency.	所谓的C-6会说，在价格稳定使命的前提下，只有经济前景可能破坏国内价格稳定的国家的央行才应该拥有获得本币的特权。
But the choice of monetary partners is nonetheless a matter of judgment.	但货币合作伙伴的选择仍只是判断问题。 比如，为何是加拿大而不是墨西哥？
For example, why Canada and not Mexico?	这两个国家不都是北美自由贸易区成员吗？
Aren’t both members of NAFTA?	为何是瑞士而不是巴西？
Why Switzerland and not Brazil, one of the largest emerging markets?	后者可视最大的新兴市场国家之一？
Picking partners is an inherently political act.	挑选合作伙伴自然是一种政治动作。
It bestows access to high-demand currencies on a select few, relatively strong, countries precisely when the weakest countries are at their most vulnerable.	它把需求程度高的货币给予一小撮选定的相对坚挺的国家，而此时最疲软国家才是最脆弱的。
Having been left outside the club, these countries have no option but to self-insure by accumulating foreign-exchange reserves.	由于被排除在这一俱乐部之外，这些国家别无选择，只能通过囤积外汇储备来保护自己。
Indeed, empirical research suggests that countries without explicit or implicit access to liquidity tend to hold much higher reserves than the privileged few – only to be blamed by the same privileged few for contributing to global imbalances by hoarding excess reserves.	事实上，实证研究表明，无法直接或间接得到流动性的国家倾向于囤积比少数特权国更多的储备，而这样做又会让少数特权国指责通过囤积外汇储备加剧了全球失衡。
The C-6 swap club’s members may be correct in thinking that global finance requires more proactive central banking.	C-6互换俱乐部成员认为全球金融需要更具前瞻性的央行业务，这是对的。
But is it fair or right that they should be allowed to take matters into their own hands and determine a system of international monetary management designed to serve their own interests, with little regard for other, equally exposed, countries?	但这就能证明应该允许它们大权独揽、决定国际货币管理体系了吗？ 这一体系难道是为了保护它们的自身利益、而不顾及其他风险同样大的国家的吗？
The joint announcement by the C-6 cements the great divide between first-class and coach economies.	C-6的联合声明坐实了一等舱经济体和大通铺经济体之间的巨大分歧。
We are being asked to trust that these select central banks will do the right thing.	我们被要求相信这些被选定的央行会做出正确的决定。
Trust is important.	信任十分重要。
But when it comes to political decision-making, democratic control and accountability are essential.	但当问题来到政治决策时，民主控制和问责才是至关重要的。
	
Europe’s Top-Down Myopia	欧洲自上而下的短视
MUNICH – The French statesman Georges Clemenceau famously remarked that, “Generals always fight the last war.”	慕尼黑—法国政治家克莱蒙梭有一句名言 ： “ 将军们打得永远是上一场战争 。 ”
Today, in the wake of the euro crisis, the same might be said of the European Union as it seeks to put itself on a more stable institutional footing.	如今，在欧元危机背景下，这句话也同样适用于寻求让自己获得更稳定的机构基础的欧盟。
The EU is undergoing fundamental changes, many of which have gone largely unnoticed, owing to the overwhelming focus on large-scale top-down reforms.	欧盟正在经历根本性变革，其中许多变革在静悄悄地进行而���有被人注意到，因为注意力绝大部分都投向了大规模的自上而下的改革。
Officials seem not to recognize change unless it takes the form of Eurobonds, new European treaties, or policy reversals by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.	官员似乎只看得见欧元债券、新欧洲条约、德国总理默克尔扭转政策方向这样的大改变。
But the case for small steps guided by market mechanisms is strong.	但由市场机制所引领的小变革也十分活跃。
Europe’s obsession with top-down reforms is rooted in prevailing analyses of the causes of the euro crisis.	欧洲沉迷于自上而下的改革，其根源在于对欧元危机原因的一致分析。
Most people in Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland blame excessive public spending and inadequate regulation in countries like Greece, Spain, and Cyprus for destabilizing the eurozone and, in turn, the EU.	大部分人德国、荷兰和芬兰人认为希腊、西班牙和塞浦路斯等国家的公共支出过度和监管不力是欧元区以及欧盟发生动荡的罪魁。
A somewhat more nuanced analysis holds that the euro itself is responsible for these countries’ problematic spending.	更细致的分析认为，欧元本身要对这些国家的支出问题负责。
The European Central Bank’s one-size-fits-all monetary policy created destabilizing imbalances in the eurozone.	欧洲央行的大一统货币政策造成了欧元区的破坏性失衡。
Interest rates were too low in Southern Europe, where governments and households binged on cheap loans, and arguably too high in Germany, which was already held back by the economic burden of reunification.	南欧利率太低，政府和家庭因为便宜的贷款而挥霍无度；而德国的利率又太高，令饱受重新统一经济负担重压的德国雪上加霜。
If the euro generated these imbalances, the argument goes, country-level solutions are inadequate.	这种观点指出，如果是欧元造成了这些失衡，那么光有国家层面的解决方案是不够的。
Europe’s only option is to repair and strengthen the currency union through banking, fiscal, and political union.	欧洲的唯一选择是通过银行、财政和政治联盟修正和强化货币联盟。
A banking union really is needed to break the vicious cycle of weak banks and debt-laden governments.	确实需要银行联盟打破银行疲软、政府负债的恶性循环。
The good news is that its contours are fairly clear, and the process of constructing it is already underway, though the pace is very slow.	好消息是银行联盟的轮廓十分清晰，建设银行联盟的过程也已经开始，尽管节奏十分缓慢。
But the logic behind fiscal union is muddier – not least because its proponents have largely failed to explain exactly what it means.	但财政联盟背后的逻辑就没有那么清晰了 — — 不仅是因为其支持者没能解释它的确切含义。
The implication is that it would entail a much larger EU budget, presumably financed by some kind of EU-wide taxation, as well as eurozone-backed unemployment insurance and a debt-mutualization mechanism like Eurobonds.	其影响是它将带来更大的欧盟预算，并很有可能需要用某种形式的欧盟税来融资，此外还将有欧元区支持的失业保险和类似于欧元债券的债务共担机制。
The centralization of financial and fiscal powers would demand increased accountability at the European level.	金融和财政权力的集中要求增加欧元层面的问责能力。
For that, a political union – with directly elected European officials and a significantly more powerful European Parliament – would be needed.	在这方面，我们需要政治联盟，即直选产生的欧洲官员加上权力大大加强的欧洲议会。
This is unlikely to happen, at least in the foreseeable future.	这是不可能的任务，至少在可预见的未来是如此。
But that probably does not matter as much as many people claim.	但这可能并不像很多人担心的那样会造成大问题。
The fact is that in designing elaborate new institutions in response to the events of the last five years, there is a risk of fighting a rearguard action, rather than looking ahead to meet new challenges.	事实是，在应对过去五年那样的危机时，设计全面细致的新机构的风险在于和顽固阻力作斗争，而不在于战胜新挑战。
After all, the eurozone crisis was rooted in the emergence of imbalances generated by the euro’s introduction and, to a lesser extent, German reunification.	毕竟，欧元区危机的根源在于欧元引入后所造成的失衡以及德国重新统一（后者只是次要根源 ） 。
But neither event will happen again.	但这两个事件都不会再次发生。
Moreover, the imbalances generated during the euro’s first decade are already being resolved.	此外，在欧元的第一个十年中所产生的失衡已经进入了解决阶段。
Indeed, the painful adjustments that southern European countries (and Ireland) have endured have led to substantially smaller external deficits and declining unit labor costs.	事实上，南欧国家（和爱尔兰）所进行的痛苦的调整已经让外部赤字大大减少，也降低了单位劳动力成本。
Nowadays, Spain’s exports are growing faster than Germany’s.	如今，西班牙的出口增长比德国还要快。
The changes that countries like Spain and Portugal are making to their labor laws, pension schemes, and regulatory systems are encouraging.	西班牙和葡萄牙等国家的变化对它们的劳动法、退休制 度和监管体系是有利的。
These improvements will put increasing pressure on France and Italy to follow suit, which could make Europe as a whole more competitive.	这些改善给法国和意大利带来了跟进的压力，从而让作为整体的欧洲变得更具竞争力。
Furthermore, the politics of the eurozone currently are not conducive to lasting reforms.	此外，目前的欧元区政治并不有利于持续改革。
The crisis has amplified the role of Germany – with its economic size and large external surplus – and made everyone else look weak.	危机放大了德国的作用 — — 因其拥有庞大的经济规模和外部盈余 — — 而让所有其他国家变得孱弱不堪。
If Europe were to thrash out a fiscal and political union now, it would look too rigidly rules-based, too Germanic.	如果欧洲现在就想研究解决财政和政治联盟问题，其结果将过于墨守成规、过于德国化。
As the rest of Europe recovers (and as Germany squanders some of its economic power by going slow on domestic reforms), Germany’s relative strength will decline.	随着欧洲其余部分的复苏（以及德国因为国内改革缓慢而丧失一些经济实力 ） ， 德国的相对优势将减弱。
An EU without one overly dominant power could probably establish more broadly acceptable – and thus more durable – institutions.	不存在高高在上的主宰势力的欧盟可能能够建立接受范围更广、从而也更能持久的机构。
If past problems are already being corrected, and future problems will be of a different kind and magnitude, then perhaps there is no need for Eurobonds or EU taxes.	如果过去的问题已经开始纠正，而未来的问题将以不同的类型和程度出现，那么也许就没有必要推出欧元债券和欧盟税。
And, without debt mutualization or large-scale redistribution of wealth, political union becomes unnecessary – at least for now.	此外，如果不搞债务共同化或大规模财富再分配，政治联盟也就失去了必要性 — — 至少现在是如此。
This is not to say that European institutions did not need more authority than they had before the crisis.	这并不是说欧洲机构不需要比危机前更大的权力。
Even without fiscal and political union, the European Commission has been empowered to supervise fiscal spending and other macroeconomic developments – such as wage growth and real-estate prices – that could cause imbalances to re-emerge.	即使没有财政和货币联盟，欧盟委员会也有权监督财政支出和其他可能导致失衡重现的宏观经济发展，如工资增长和房地产价格。
Likewise, the ECB, together with national bodies, has gained the authority to supervise major eurozone banks.	类似地，欧洲央行以及国家有关部门已经获得了监督主要欧元区银行的权力。
But it is also critical to recognize that financial markets have become more disciplined.	但同样关键的是，金融市场已经变得更守纪律。
Herein lies the discrepancy between those who put their faith in institutional fixes and those who trust a more bottom-up approach.	相信机构调整和相信自下而上方针的人之间的分歧就在此处。
Many people, especially in the United Kingdom and the United States, seem to believe that “solving” the euro crisis means returning to the Elysian state in which all European government bonds are equally risk-free assets.	许多人，特别是英国人和美国人，似乎认为“解决”欧元区危机就意味着回归所有欧洲政府债券被一视同仁为无风险资产的乐土。
But, for Germans, Dutch, and Austrians, interest-rate spreads are not the problem; they are part of the solution, given that they impose discipline that extends beyond European institutions’ new powers.	但是，对德国人、荷兰人和奥地利人来说，利差不是问题，而是解决方案的一部分，因为利差加强了纪律，并扩张到欧洲机构的新权力之外。
The eurozone’s new institutional framework does not have to direct 18 countries’ fiscal and economic policies. It just needs to be strong enough to enable markets to recognize and react to worrying developments, while offering real help to countries that find themselves temporarily in trouble.	欧元区的新机构框架并不一定要指导18个国家的财政和经济政策，儿只需要足够强大从而让市场认识到令人担忧的发展态势并做出反应，同时为暂时陷入麻烦的国家提供真正的帮助。
This is not only doable; it is being done.	这不仅是可行的，也正在进行中。
Now European countries can turn to the challenge of becoming more flexible and productive so that they can be more competitive in the future.	现在欧洲国家可以转向新的挑战：增加灵活性、改善生产率，从而在未来变得更有竞争力。

The False Promise of Digital Democracy	数字民主的假承诺
MUNICH – Most people used to think of the Internet as a force for good.	慕尼黑—大部分人都把互联网看成是好力量。
It was supposed to allow us not only to shop, stay in touch with former classmates, and find a new sushi restaurant; it was also supposed to empower us politically by allowing the disenfranchised to make their voices heard, help activists mobilize supporters, and enable ordinary citizens to publicize evidence of official corruption or police brutality.	互联网不但可以让我们购物、和老同学取得联系、找到新开的寿司店，还能让被剥夺公民权的人发出声音从而让我们得到更多的政治力量、帮助活动家动员支持者、让普通民众能够公布官员腐败或警察暴力行为的证据。
But doubts have crept in – and not only since the revelations of government agencies’ use of the Internet to spy on us, our leaders, and one another.	但质疑声也接踵而至 — — 并非在政府机构利用互联网监控彼此、我们和我们的领导人被曝光后才是如此。
The Internet’s impact on politics is deeply ambiguous.	互联网对政治的影响是非常模糊的。
Unless and until it becomes a space where rules and rights apply like they do in the real world, that is unlikely to change.	除非在我们可以在像现实生活中那样在互联网上行使规则和权利，否则就无法改变这一点。
Early enthusiasts dreamed that mere access to the Internet would help spread democracy.	早期拥趸梦想着靠接入互联网就能帮助传播民主。
This did not happen.	这并没有发生。
At the end of the 1990’s, 4% of the world’s population was using the Internet; today, almost 40% do.	20世纪90年代末，只有4%的世界人口在使用与联网。 如今这一比例是40 % 。
But the share of countries classified as “not free” or “partly free” by the democracy watchdog Freedom House has hardly changed over the same period.	但被民主观察机构自由之家（Freedom House）归类为“不自由”或“部分自由”的国家比例在同一时期并未发生多大变化。
In the battle between networks and hierarchies, the hierarchies seem to be winning more often than not.	在网络和层级之间的战争中，更常获胜的是层级。
One reason is that governments have become as skillful at using the Internet and modern communications technology as activists.	一个原因是政府越来越擅长利用活跃的互联网和现代通信技术。
Autocratic governments use it to track down protest and opposition leaders, as we have recently seen in Ukraine.	专制政府利用它追踪抗议活动和反对派领袖，最近的乌克兰就是如此。
They employ armies of people to vet and skew online conversations.	它们部署网络水军判断和引导网络话语。
Some people even argue that the Internet acts as a political release valve that helps dictators stay in power.	一些人甚至认为互联网是一种政治减压阀，有助于独裁者掌权。
But even the most determined autocrat cannot fully control political activity online.	但即使是最强大的独裁者也无法完全控制网络活动。
Tech-savvy young people tend to circumvent attempts at official censorship.	长于技术的年轻人总是能够绕过官方审查措施。
And yet Internet activists are not necessarily gaining power.	但互联网活跃分子并不一定能够赢得力量。
Internet-inspired movements usually have lasting impact only if they generate traditional political activity, such as street protests or the establishment of political parties.	互联网推动的运动往往只有在产生了传统政治活动时 — — 如街头抗议或建立政党等 — — 才能形成持续影响。
For this, they need leadership, which net activists tend to reject, because they view themselves as pure grassroots movements.	因此，它们需要领袖，而这往往被网络活动家所拒绝，因为他们视自己为纯草根运动。
In the absence of viable strategies and clear direction, most Internet-aided uprisings have dissipated quickly.	大部分互联网支持的骚乱没有可行的战略和明确的方向，很快就消散了。
The Internet has thus turned out to be less potent than expected in the fight against tyranny.	因此，就与暴政的斗争而言，互联网并不像预期的那样给力。
Nor is its effect on established democracies straightforward.	其对建立民主的影响力也没有那么直观。
While democracies have arguably become more vibrant, their politics have become more volatile.	尽管民主国家变得更有活力，但它们的政治也变得日益波动。
Consider the media.	以媒体为例。
Only 16% of Americans in their 40’s read (print) newspapers these days; the share among 20-somethings is 6%.	如今只有16%的40—50年龄段美国人读（印刷）报纸；20岁以下人群比例更是只有6 % 。
Digital media offer great diversity, easy access, and opportunities to comment.	数字媒体提供了充分的多样性、轻易的获取渠道和评论机会。
But they encourage people to retrieve only information and commentaries that fit their existing views.	但它们也鼓励人们只接受符合既有观念的信息和评论。
While traditional media can present their readers with balanced coverage, digital media can fuel political polarization.	传统媒体可以为读者呈现平衡的报道，数字媒体则可能助长政治两极分化。
Moreover, political firebrands, populists, and radicals, from Italy’s Beppe Grillo to American Tea Party members, use social media and the blogosphere to appeal directly to potential supporters.	此外，政治煽动者、民粹主义者和激进分子 — — 从意大利的格里洛（Beppe Grillo）到美国的茶党成员 — — 利用社交媒体和博客圈直接面向潜在支持者。
The Internet allows many political upstarts to amass a large following quickly, only to disappear just as fast.	互联网让许多政治新星迅速地集结大量追随者，但来得快去得也快。
But the ebb and flow can unsettle established politics – for example, when centrist parties move to the right to lure voters away from more extreme parties.	然则如此兴衰更替可能动摇现行政治 — — 比如当中间派政党转为右倾以吸引更为极端的政党的选民时。
At the same time, young people seem to think that they have exhausted their civic duties by tweeting and blogging.	与此同时，年轻人可能认为发几条微博和博客就算行使了他们的公民责任。
They no longer join political parties, trade unions, and other interest groups.	他们不再参与政党、工会和其他利益集团。
The average age of party members in Germany is over 50.	德国的政党成员平均年龄超过了50岁。
In the United Kingdom, a retiree over 60 is more likely to be a trade-union member than a worker under 30 is.	在英国，60多岁的退休者比不到30的工人更有可能是工会成员。
Without civil-society organizations, politics becomes more fragmented and less cohesive – and finding workable compromises becomes harder.	没有公民社会组织，政治变得更加支离破碎，凝聚力更小，更难找到可行的承诺。
The revelations of snooping by the US National Security Agency (NSA) will hasten a more realistic assessment of the Internet’s effect on politics, providing a welcome opportunity to consider what has gone wrong and what could be put right.	美国国家安全局监控丑闻的曝光将加快对互联网政治影响的更加现实的评估，提供难得的机会思考是什么出了问题以及怎样做对的事。
A multitude of small steps could help – such as giving pro-democracy movements the technology needed to evade autocrats, presenting digital media in a balanced way, and making political parties more responsive to their members.	一系列小步骤可以有所助益 — — 如给予亲民主运动躲避专制所必须的工具、以平衡的方式呈现数字媒体，以及提高政党对其党员的响应度。
But the fundamental challenge is to suffuse the Internet with the same rules, rights, and values that pervade our democracies.	但根本挑战是用我们的民主中的相同规则、权利和价值充实互联网。
Freedom cannot be absolute, whether online or offline.	自由永远不是绝对的，不管在线上还是在线下。
Human rights, and not only the right to personal privacy, must be respected in cyberspace.	人权 — — 不仅仅是个人隐私权 — — 在网络空间中叶必须得到尊重。
Because no single body or government sets rules for the entire Internet, any digital code of conduct would have to emerge from the grassroots – and thus would be highly imperfect.	由于没有个人和政府为整个互联网制定规则，因此任何数字行为规范都必须来自草根 — — 也因此必然是极不完美的。
But perhaps the NSA has helped start the discussion: though we may not know which rules we want, we may now have gained a much better idea of which rules we do not want.	但也许美国国安局帮助我们开启了讨论：尽管我们可能不知道想要什么规则，但至少已经有了关于我们不想要什么规则的好主意。
	
The Fear of “L”	“L”恐慌
WASHINGTON, DC – For the last few years, economists have been running through the alphabet to describe the shape of the long-awaited recovery – starting with an optimistic V, proceeding to a more downbeat U, and ending up at a despairing W. But now a deeper anxiety is beginning to stalk the profession: the fear of what I call an “L-shaped” recovery.	华盛顿—过去几年来，经济学家一直在用字母表描述期待已久的复苏 — — 一开始是乐观的“V ” ， 接着是不那么乐观的“U ” ， 最后是令人绝望的“W ” 。 但如今经济学界开始出现更深的焦虑，我将此称为“L”型复苏恐慌。
Viewed in the light of the past five dismal years, 2013 was not bad for the advanced economies.	从过去的令人失望的五年看，2013年对发达经济体来说并不坏。
The eurozone technically emerged from recession, the unemployment rate in the United States was lower than in previous years, and Japan began to stir after a long slumber and the negative shock of the earthquake and tsunami in 2011.	欧元区从技术上走出了衰退，美国的失业率也比前几年低，日本也在长期萎靡和2011年地震和海啸冲击之后开始觉醒。
But if we look beneath the surface, it becomes evident that we are still hovering on the edge of a precipice.	但如果透过表现看本质，那么很显然我们仍在悬崖边缘徘徊。
In the third quarter of this year, GDP contracted, on a year-on-year basis, not just in well-known cases like Greece and Portugal, but also in Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, and the Czech Republic.	今年3季度，GDP同比出现了收缩，不仅希腊、葡萄牙等出了名的疲软国是如此，意大利、西班牙、荷兰和捷克也是如此。
And GDP in some countries, like France and Sweden, grew at rates lower than population growth, implying that per capita income declined.	法国和瑞典等国的GDP增长则赶不上人口，这意味着人均收入下降。
Moreover, labor-market conditions deteriorated toward the end of the year.	此外，随着年底临近，劳动力市场状况在恶化。
The number of unemployed in Germany grew for four consecutive months up to November.	今年前11个月，德国失业人口连续四年增加。
Among the industrialized countries, the US is the bright spot.	在工业化国家中，美国一枝独秀。
But, even there, while the unemployment rate has dropped during the year, and now stands at 7%, long-term joblessness is at an unusually high 36% of total unemployment, threatening to erode the skills base and make recovery that much more difficult.	但是，即使在美国，失经过一整年的下降后，失业率仍有7 % ， 长期失业占总失业的比重则高达反常的36 % ， 这意味着技能基础可能会受到影响，复苏将更加艰难。
Japan’s revival, meanwhile, was caused by a much-needed liquidity injection.	与此同时，日本的复苏是由急需的流动性注入所带来。
But Japan’s upturn will be short-lived unless Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government follows through on its promise of deeper structural reforms.	但日本的上升之势将是短暂的，除非首相安倍晋三的政府兑现其深化结构性改革的承诺。
Given these developments, a few commentators have written recently about the possibility of a prolonged slowdown in industrialized countries.	基于这些发展态势，一些评论者最近开始大谈工业化国家长期减速的可能性。
This is not a popular view, with others criticizing its advocates for stoking pessimism.	这一观点并不受欢迎，一些人批评这是咋刺激悲观情绪。
But the pessimists cannot be dismissed out of hand.	但眼下我们无法驳倒悲观者。
The fear of an L-shaped recovery is legitimate.	“L”型复苏恐慌有其合理性。
Modern technology has enabled workers in emerging economies to join a global labor market; in the absence of major policy innovation, this is likely to cause a prolonged drag on rich countries.	现代技术使得新兴经济体工人加入到全球劳动力市场；在没有重大政策创新的背景下，这可能造成对发达国家的长期拖累。
And there are few signs of innovation.	而创新的迹象难以寻觅。
There is, instead, a crisis of the economics profession, one that mirrors the crisis of the advanced economies.	相反，经济学界也存在一场危机，一场与发达经济体危机相映成趣的危机。
Thanks to technological change and relentless globalization, the character of entire economies has changed dramatically over the last 50 years.	由于技术变迁和突进的全球化，在过去50年里，整体经济的性质发生了剧烈的变化。
This has not been matched by changes in policymakers’ thinking.	而决策者思维并没有跟上。
Why this stasis?	为什么会这样？
One possibility is that the same factors that are making entrepreneurs over-cautious about new ventures are making policymakers prone to conservatism.	一种可能是，让企业家对创业企业过度谨慎的相同因素也促使决策者容易陷入保守。
An engaging paper by the World Bank economists Leora Klapper and Inessa Love shows that one major consequence of the financial crisis has been entrepreneurs’ reluctance to start new firms.	世界银行经济学家克莱普尔（Leora Klapper）和洛夫（Inessa Love）的一篇出色论文指出，金融危机的重大后果之一是企业家不再愿意创办新企业。
They show that after a steady increase from 2004 to 2007, firm creation dropped sharply.	他们指出，在2004年—2007年的稳步增长后，创业数量大幅下降。
In the United Kingdom, for example, the number of newly registered limited-liability companies fell from 450,000 in 2007 to 372,000 in 2008 and 330,000 in 2009.	比如，在英国，新注册有限责任公司数量2007年为45万家，2008年为37万2千家，2009年为33万家。
What is interesting is that while this decline is most marked in advanced economies, which are especially dependent on financial markets, it is visible in virtually all of the 95 countries that the authors studied.	有趣的是，尽管这一下降趋势主要出现在特别倚重金融市场的发达经济体，但在两位作者所研究的95个国家中，几乎每一个都能察觉到这一变化。
The reason is not hard to fathom: A recession is a time when we tend to become cautious and stick to familiar territory, steering clear of new projects.	原因不难弄清：衰退时我们倾向于变得谨慎，坚守熟悉的领域，回避新项目。
The same mindset has become apparent among economists and policymakers.	同样的思维也明显地存在于经济学家和决策者的脑海中。
In times of profound uncertainty, the tendency is to cling to the domain of the familiar and avoid innovative thinking.	在存在重大不确定性的时期，有一种坚持熟悉领域、避免创新思维的倾向。
This is especially unfortunate nowadays, when the structure of the global economy is changing rapidly.	眼下，这一倾向尤其不幸，因为全球经济的结构正在快速变化。
A telltale sign of over-caution among economists and policymakers has been their propensity to convert the need for evidence to an aversion to analytical creativity.	经济学家和决策者过度谨慎的一个迹象是他们从要求证据变成厌恶分析创新。
We should, of course, use the best available evidence in crafting policy.	当然，在制定政策中，我们应该使用能获得的最好的证据。
But there are areas in which there is no evidence.	但有些领域没有证据可循。
In these uncharted territories, one must rely on a combination of intuition and theory.	在这些未知领域，你必须依靠直觉和理论相结合。
To resist new policy on the grounds that it is not founded in hard evidence is to trap us in the status quo.	抵制没有过硬证据的新政策将我们困在了现状之中。
To see the mistake in this criticism, imagine that, on the basis of theory and some assumptions, one recommends new policy X, even though there is no hard evidence regarding whether or not X works.	要理解这一批评中的错误，设想你在理论和一定的假设的基础上建议实施新政策X，但你没有关于X是否奏效的过硬证据。
Now use Y to refer to “not doing X.”	现在假设实施Y意味着“不实施X ” 。
If there is no evidence regarding whether X works, there clearly is no evidence concerning whether Y works.	如果没有关于X是否奏效的证据，也显然没有关于Y是否奏效的证据。
So, if the lack of evidence is considered a good reason not to do X, it is also a good reason not to do Y. But this is a contradiction, because it is impossible not to do either X or Y.	因此，如果缺少证据被认为是不采用X的好理由，那么它同样也是不采取Y的好理由。 但这就形成了一个悖论，因为你不可能既不实施X，也不实施Y。
The propensity to use this inconsistent argument reflects a proclivity for the status quo and a bias against policy innovation.	持有这一站不住脚的观念体现了偏袒现状、阻挠政策创新的倾向。
But what we need now is precisely the type of new analytical thinking that spurred the great advances of economics as a discipline over the last two and a half centuries – and that led to major policy breakthroughs during the Great Depression.	但我们现在所需要的正是新的分析思维，新的分析思维刺激了经济学作为一门学科在过去两个半世纪取得重大进步，也刺激了大萧条期间的重大政策突破。
It is the absence of such creative thinking that has led the economics profession into an impasse, forcing economists and policymakers to contend with the fear of “L.”	缺少创造性思维让经济学界陷入了死胡同，也迫使经济学家和决策者陷入了“L”恐慌。
	
Reason and the End of Poverty	推理和贫困的终结
WASHINGTON, DC – The World Bank has set two new goals for itself: ending extreme and chronic poverty in the world by 2030, and promoting shared prosperity, defined in terms of progress of the poorest 40% of the population in each society.	华盛顿—世界银行给自己制定了两个新目标：2030年终结全世界的极端和长期贫困，并促进共同繁荣 — — 衡量标准是各个社会最贫困40%人群的改善。
Now that the United Nations General Assembly Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals has endorsed the Bank’s anti-poverty target, debate about how to achieve it has revived an old question: Will the benefits of economic growth trickle down on their own, reaching all, or will we need targeted redistributive policies?	联合国大会可持续发展目标开放工作组（Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals）支持世行的减贫目标，而关于如何实现的争论让我们重新面对了一个老问题：经济增长的好处会自动向下流动、触及所有人，还是需要定向的分配政策？
Many people remain in the growth-only camp only because of an error in deductive reasoning; unlike committed ideologues, they can be weaned from their position.	许多人站在唯增长论阵营，之所以如此，唯一原因是演绎推理的错误；与坚定的空想家不同，他们可以转变立场。
That is why the World Bank’s second goal of promoting shared prosperity is important not only in itself, but as an essential complement to the goal of ending poverty.	正因如此，世界银行的第二个目标 — — 促进共同繁荣的重要性不但在于其本身，也在于其是终结贫困目标的不可缺少的部分。
Recognizing that some “frictional” poverty will inevitably persist over the next two decades, the World Bank’s formal target is to reduce the percentage of people living below the poverty line – defined as daily consumption of less than $1.25 (in purchasing-power-parity terms) per person – to less than 3%.	世界银行认识到一些“摩擦性”贫困在未来二十年是不可避免的，因此其正式目标让生活在贫困线以下的人的比重低于3 % 。 贫困线的标准是每人每天消费少于1.25美元（以购买力平价衡量 ） 。
World Bank research predicts that if all countries grow at the same rates that they did over the past 20 years, with no change in income distribution, world poverty will fall to 7.7% by 2030, from 17.7% in 2010.	世行研究预测，如果所有国家都以与过去20年相同的速度增长，且收入分配情况不变，则2030年世界贫困率将从2010年的17.7%降至7.7 % 。
If they grow faster, at the average rates recorded in the 2000’s, the poverty rate will fall to 5.5%.	如果增长得更快，达到2000年代的平均增长率，则贫困率将下降至5.5 % 。
These numbers suggest that growth alone is unlikely to get us to the 3% target.	这些数字表明光靠增长无法达到3%的目标。
But this is mere suggestion.	但这仅仅是“表明 ” 。
One can argue that we should nonetheless rely on growth and simply adopt measures that encourage more of it.	你可以说，我们应该依靠增长，只是要采取进一步提振增长的手段。
In a new paper, David Dollar, Tatjana Kleineberg, and Aart Kraay analyze empirically the relationship between growth and poverty.	在一篇新论文中，多拉（David Dollar ） 、 克莱因伯格（Tatjana Kleineberg）和库雷（Aart Kraay）从实证角度分析了增长和贫困的关系。
Their comprehensive study draws on high-quality survey data from 118 countries and reaches a clear conclusion: the bulk of poverty eradication that took place in recent decades was driven by economies’ overall income growth.	他们的全面研究建立在118个国家的高质量调查数据之上，并得出了明确的结论：近几十年以来的减贫成就大部分要归功于经济的总体收入增长。
More specifically, 77% of the cross-country variation in the income growth of the poorest 40% of the population reflects differences in average income growth.	更具体地说，最贫困的40%的人口的收入增长的77%的跨国差异反映了平均收入增长的差异。
Findings like these lead many people to conclude that eradicating poverty requires us to rely on overall growth, and that direct government policy interventions have little merit.	此类发现让许多人认为减贫要求我们依赖总体增长，直接政府政策干预没有什么效果。
But this is a wrong conclusion, which illustrates a lapse of logic.	但这一结论是错误的，它体现了错误的逻辑。
To see why, suppose that in 1930 an economist conducted an empirical study of what cured infectious diseases, and, analyzing masses of data from previous years, concluded that 98% of all treatable illnesses were cured by non-antibiotic medicines – “tradicines,” which include all traditional medicines of various schools.	我们来看看为什么。 假设1930年有一位经济学家做了什么治好了流行病的实证研究，在分析了大量往昔年份数据后，他认为98%的可治疗治病是通过非抗生素 — — 即各种各样的“传统药物 ” — —治好的。
This conclusion would most likely be valid, because the use of antibiotics before 1930 – just two years after Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin and years before it was fully workable as a cure – was rare and mostly inadvertent.	这一结论很有可能是成立的，因为在1930年以前 — — 此时弗莱明刚刚发现盘尼西林两年，距离盘尼西林的全面使用还有多年时间 — — 很少使用抗生素，即使用了也往往不是有意为之。
But now suppose that the economist goes on to argue that, therefore, it would be silly to give patients penicillin, because we know that 98% of all treatable diseases were cured by tradicines, and penicillin is not a tradicine.	但再假设这位经济学家继续指出，因此，给病人使用盘尼西林是愚蠢的，因为我们知道98%的可治疗疾病是通过传统药物治愈的，而盘尼西林不属于传统药物。
That is a wrong deduction, based on evidence that does not exist.	这是错误的演绎，它的基础是子虚乌有的证据。
What the economist’s study in 1930 showed is that tradicines accounted for 98% of the cases that were successfully treated.	这位1930年的经济学家的研究表明了传统药物在98%的被治愈疾病中起了作用。
It does not show that penicillin does not work.	它并没有标明盘尼西林起不了作用。
This is a common mistake.	这是个常见错误。
We often hear assertions like, “We must rely on the private sector to create jobs, because studies show that 90% of past jobs were created by the private sector.”	我们经常听到这样的论断 ： “ 我们必须依靠私人部门创造就业，因为研究表明90%的昔日岗位是私人部门创造的 。 ”
If we accepted this reasoning, we would have to accept a Soviet researcher’s assertion in the late 1980’s that we must rely on the state to create jobs, because 90% of past jobs were created by the state.	如果我们接受这一推理，我们同样也必须接受1980年代末一位苏联经济学家的论断 — — 我们必须依靠国家创造就业，因为90%的昔日岗位是由国家创造的。
On job creation, there is both theory and evidence to support the conclusion that the private sector is the main driver of sustainable expansion (which is not to deny that there may be scope for tweaking public policies to make the private sector more employment-friendly).	在就业创造方面，理论和证据都支持私人部门是可持续扩张的主要动力的结论（这并没有否认存在让私人部门变得更加利于就业的公共政策空间 ） 。
But on poverty eradication, theory and evidence show that policy interventions, when skillfully designed, can play a significant role.	但在减贫方面，理论和证据表明政策干预 — — 如果设计合理的话 — — 可以扮演重要角色。
Some of these policies already exist; some have to be crafted – the antibiotics of our time.	一些政策已经存在，一些则需要构思 — — 它们就是现时代的抗生素。
In India, the government has tried for decades to get cheap food to the poor.	在印度，政府尝试为穷人提供廉价食品已有数十年。
Cost-benefit analysis has led many to declare it a failed policy.	成本收益分析让许多人认为这是项失败的政策。
But the fault lies with the program’s method, which is to rely on the state both to collect the food from farmers and to deliver it to the poor.	但问题在于该计划的方法 — — 从农民手中收集食品和把食品送到穷人手中的过程都依赖国家。
Around 45% of food grain leaks out and disappears in this process.	大约45%的食用谷物在此过程中漏出并下落不明。
This means that the program’s leaks need to be repaired, not that the entire scheme should be abandoned.	这意味着该计划需要填补漏洞，而不意味着应该抛弃整套机制。
A carefully designed public-private partnership – in which the state gives a subsidy directly to the poor, who then buy food from private farmers and traders – would benefit all.	谨慎设计的公私合作 — — 国家直接向穷人发放补贴，然后穷人从私人农民和贸易商手中购买粮食 — — 能让所有人受益。
Obviously, when the poor have more (and healthier) food, their nutrition improves; when better-nourished people go to school, they become more productive; the same is true of health services.	显然，当穷人拥有更多（更健康）的食物时，营养就能得到改善；当营养更好的人们进入学校时，他们的生产率就会得到提高；同样的道理也适用于健康服务方面。
Overall economic growth is important, but the poor should not have to wait until its benefits trickle down to them; with the right anti-poverty policies, governments can encourage trickle-up growth as well.	总体经济增长十分重要，但穷人不能坐等好处渗透到自己身上；在正确的减贫措施的帮助下，政府也能够鼓励自下而上渗透的增长。
	
A Radioactive Bank to be Welcomed	值得欢迎的放射性元素银行
CANBERRA – One of the many things the world has learned from the Iran nuclear saga is that its leaders made a mistake, when negotiating the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in the 1960s, in not doing anything to constrain uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing.	堪培拉—世界从伊朗核传奇中学到的众多教训之一是其领导人在20世纪60年代谈判核不扩散条约式犯了一个错误，没有做任何事情约束铀浓缩和钚再处理。
This failure apparently stemmed from the belief – long since proven wrong, certainly in the case of uranium – that the only states ever likely to possess that technical capability already possessed nuclear weapons, or (like Germany) were totally committed never to acquire them.	这一错误显然源自一个早就在铀问题上被证明错误的信念 — — 仅有的那些有可能拥有这一技术能力的国家要么已经拥有了核武器，要么（如德国）承诺永远不会拥有该能力。
As a result, any member state can argue for its “inalienable right” under the NPT to pursue any stage of the nuclear fuel cycle.	结果，任何成员国都可以主张根据核不扩散条约拥有追求核燃料循环任何阶段的“不可侵犯的权利 ” 。
Although any such right extends only to activities for “peaceful purposes,” the loophole is gaping.	尽管这一权利只适用于“和平目的”活动，但存在巨大的漏洞。
Any technically capable state – and there are now dozens of them – can build uranium enrichment facilities with the official purpose of producing fuel for nuclear power or research reactors, but which are nonetheless inherently capable of producing the much higher-grade fuel needed for nuclear weapons.	任何有技术能力的国家 — — 目前有几十个之多 — — 都可以建造核浓缩设施，只要官方目的是为核能或研究性反应堆生产能源，但它们当然都有能力制造核武器所需要的更高级别的燃料。
It is not for nothing that such facilities have been described as “bomb starter kits,” and that Iran’s progress down that path – whether deliberately designed to give it a latent weapons breakout capability or not – has spooked so many others in the international community.	这些设施被称为“核弹发射装置”不是没有道理，伊朗在这方面取得进展 — — 不管是否有意设计成具有潜在武器突破能力 — — 让国际社会的许多国家恐慌不已。
That is why there was so much pressure to produce the deal now on the table, which dramatically limits Iran’s enrichment capability.	因此才会有如此大的压力促成了现在摆到台面上的协议，该协议极大地限制了伊朗的核浓缩能力。
While renegotiating the NPT itself to close the enrichment loophole seems for now a lost cause, there are other ways to address this proliferation risk.	如今，重新谈判核不扩散条约本身、补上浓缩漏洞纯属出新妄想，但又其他办法可以遏制这一核扩散风险。
One of the most important, and long-advocated, strategies is to demonstrate to countries that rely on nuclear power, or are planning to develop it, that they do not need their own uranium-enrichment program to ensure their fuel supply’s security.	最重要的办法之一、也得到长期支持的战略是向依赖或计划发展核能的国家证明，它们不需要拥有自己的核浓缩计划来确保能源供给安全。
Concern about fuel-supply security has always been Iran’s main publicly stated justification for acquiring its enrichment capability – a justification that its critics assert was manufactured simply to conceal a covert weapons agenda.	担心燃料供给安全一直是伊朗为获得铀浓缩能力厄尔提出的主要公开理由 — — 批评者指出，这一理由纯粹是为了掩盖武器日程而捏造的。
Whether or not that is the case, all current and would-be nuclear power producers are entitled to be anxious about having an absolutely assured fuel supply, given the major economic and social consequences they would face in the event of a disruption.	无论是否真的如此，所有当前和潜在核能生产商都有权利担忧有绝对保障的燃料供给，因为一旦发生干扰，将带来巨大的经济和社会后果。
Yes, until now, the commercial nuclear-fuel market has worked well: no power reactor has had to shut down because of fuel-supply disruptions.	诚然，到目前为止，商业核燃料市场运转良好：没有一个核反应堆因为燃料供给干扰而关闭。
But the cut-off of the supply of other energy resources (notably Russia’s disruption of natural-gas supplies to Ukraine and, by extension, to Western Europe) has raised legitimate concerns about whether this could happen with nuclear fuel.	但切断其他能源资源的供给（令人关注的有俄罗斯干扰乌克兰进而影响西欧的天然气供给）引起了关于核燃料是否也会发生类似事件的合理担忧。
Although the issue has been much debated, until now there has been only modest progress in developing fuel-supply assurance arrangements that would meet this concern.	尽管这一问题经过了大量争论，但到目前为止，在制定燃料供给保障安排以解决这一担忧方面，进展十分有限。
Russia, with the support of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), maintains a sizeable reserve of low-enriched uranium (LEU) at its international center in Angarsk; but, in the current security environment, there has been understandable international reluctance to rely on it.	在国际原子能机构的支持下，俄罗斯安加尔斯克（Angarsk）国际中心保留了大量低浓缩铀储备；但是，在当前的安全环境下，不难理解国际社会不愿意依赖这些能源。
The United Kingdom has proposed a supply guarantee of its own, though it has so far attracted little attention.	英国已提出其自身的供给保障安排，尽管到目前为止没有受到多少关注。
Now, in an important new development, to be officially launched this month (on August 27), Kazakhstan is establishing a major new international fuel bank, which it will operate on behalf of the IAEA.	如今，在一项将在本月（8月27日）正式启动的计划中，哈萨克斯坦将成立一家新的国际燃料银行，并代表国际原子能机构经营它。
The new facility should once and for all remove the main excuse that has been advanced, sincerely or not, for building and maintaining homegrown enrichment capability.	该新银行理应一劳永逸地消除一直以来为了维持本国铀浓缩能力而有意或无意地宣传的借口。
Scheduled to commence operations in 2017, the Kazakh fuel bank will store up to 90 tons of LEU, sufficient to refuel three typical power-producing light water reactors.	按计划，哈萨克燃料银行将在2017年开张营业，它将储存90吨低浓缩铀，足以为三个典型的发电用轻水反应堆提供燃料补给。
While Kazakhstan will physically operate the bank, the uranium will be owned and controlled by the IAEA, and made available to non-nuclear-weapon states if, for any reason, they cannot secure the LEU they need from the commercial market.	该银行由哈萨克斯坦实际经营，但铀将由国际原子能机构所有和控制，并且只能用于无核武器国家，条件是（不管出于什么原因）它们无法从商业市场上获得它们所需要的低浓缩铀。
Provided the state in question is in compliance with its comprehensive non-proliferation safeguards agreement with the IAEA, it can draw the required fuel from the bank and transfer it to a fuel fabricator to make fuel assemblies for the reactors involved.	如果问题国家遵守其与国际原子能机构的全面核不扩散安全保障协议，它���以从该银行获得所需要的燃料，运送至燃料生产商为相关核反应堆制作燃料组件。
The Kazakh fuel bank has very wide and high-level international backing, helped by the country’s credentials.	哈萨克燃料银行获得了十分广泛的高级别国际支持，这要归功于哈萨克斯坦的国家信誉。
A former nuclear test-site state, Kazakhstan willingly gave up the nuclear weapons on its territory when the opportunity arose with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and it has been a strong and consistent advocate of nuclear arms control and disarmament ever since.	作为前核试验场地所在国，哈萨克斯坦愿意在苏联解体时放弃拥有核武器的良机，并且此后一直强烈支持核武器控制和裁军。
The bank has been funded by voluntary contributions, including $50 million from the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a United States-based NGO, $49 million from the US government, up to $25 million from the European Union, $10 million each from Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, and $5 million from Norway.	该银行通过自愿捐款筹集资金，包括来自美国非政府组织核威胁计划（Nuclear Threat Initiative）的5,000万美元、来自美国政府的4,900万美元，来自欧盟的最多2,500万美元，来自科威特和阿联酋的1,000万美元以及来自挪威的500万美元。
Aside from the Iran deal, good news on nuclear weapons has been sparse in recent years.	除了伊朗协议，关于核武器的好消息在近几年里鲜有耳闻。
The new Kazakh fuel bank is a significant step toward achieving a world free of nuclear weapons.	新的哈萨克燃料银行是迈向无核世界的重大进步。
Those who have worked to establish it deserve the world’s gratitude.	致力于成立这家银行的人应该获得全世界的感谢。
	
A Young State in an Uncertain World	身处不确定世界的年轻国家
ALMATY – In mid-November, Kazakhstan hosted the third annual “Astana Club,” a new independent and unbiased platform for dialogue among international experts, politicians, and media representatives on the “critical issues affecting all the countries of Eurasia.”	阿拉木图—11月中旬，哈萨克斯坦主办了第三次“阿斯塔纳俱乐部”年会。 阿斯塔纳俱乐部是一个新成立的国际商界领袖、政治家、媒体代表和其他专家就“影响欧亚全体国家的关键问题”进行探讨的独立和中立的平台。
The event epitomized Kazakhstan’s foreign policy over the last two decades, at a moment when that policy is set to confront unprecedented tests.	它是哈萨克斯坦过去二十年来外交政策成果的集中体现，如今，哈萨克斯坦外交政策正面临前所未有的考验。
Participants in this year’s Astana Club were as high-profile as they were diverse.	今年阿斯塔纳俱乐部的与会者规格高且多样化。
They included representatives of leading think tanks from Europe, Asia, the United States, and the Middle East; former presidents, such as Turkey’s Abdullah Gül and Slovenia’s Danilo Türk; former European Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner; Indian member of parliament Shashi Tharoor; and CEO of Channel One Russia Konstantin Ernst.	其中包括来自欧洲、亚洲、美国和中东的领先智库代表；一些前国家首脑，如土耳其的居尔和斯洛文尼亚的图尔克；前欧盟委员费雷罗-沃尔德纳（Benita Ferrero-Waldner ） ； 印度议会议员沙鲁尔（Shashi Tharoor）以及俄罗斯一频道（Channel One Russia）首席执行官恩斯特（Konstantin Ernst ） 。
The discussions took place in the Nazarbayev Centre, housed in an imposing and futuristic building designed by the renowned British architect Norman Foster.	讨论在纳扎尔巴耶夫中心举行，这是一座美轮美奂的未来主义建筑，由英国著名建筑师福斯特（Norman Foster）设计。
In a scene reminiscent of the intergalactic assembly in Star Wars, participants sat at a large table encircling a map of Eurasia to discuss the emerging world order, great power rivalries, sanction wars, nuclear proliferation, and regional integration projects.	会议的情景很像是《星球大战》中的星系议会，与会者坐在一张大桌子旁，四周环绕着欧亚地图，讨论新兴国际秩序、大国对立、制裁战争、核扩散和地区一体化等议题。
This combination of status-seeking public relations and the provision of public goods that characterizes the Astana Club discussions has long been a feature of Kazakhstan’s foreign policy.	阿斯塔纳俱乐部的讨论既是追求地位（status-seeking）的公关活动，也提供公共品，这一组合也是哈萨克斯坦外交政策的长期特征。
For example, every three years Kazakhstan hosts a Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions, for which it commissioned Foster to build another imposing and futuristic building, the Palace of Peace and Reconciliation.	比如，每三年，哈萨克斯坦都要举办一次世界和传统宗教领导人会议（Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions ） ， 为此，哈萨克斯坦委托福斯特设计了另一座美轮美奂的未来主义建筑 — — 和平和妥协宫（Palace of Peace and Reconciliation）
Kazakhstan’s leadership has also worked to place itself at the forefront of the international non-proliferation movement.	哈萨克斯坦领导层还致力于让这个国家成为国际不扩散运动的先锋。
And this past October, talks were held in Astana, the capital, on the Syrian crisis, with representatives of the Syrian government and some armed opposition groups in attendance – despite Kazakhstan’s distance from the tragic developments in that country.	在刚刚过去的10月份，首都阿斯塔纳举行了叙利亚危机谈判，来自叙利亚政府和一些武装反对集团的代表出席了会议 — — 尽管哈萨克斯坦和叙利亚的悲剧相隔万里之遥。
This approach emerged soon after Kazakhstan’s independence in 1991, when the country initiated the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia, modeled after the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (now the OSCE).	这一方针在1991年哈萨克斯坦独立后不久便开始实施。 当时，哈萨克斯坦效仿欧洲安全与合作会议（即现在的欧安组织 ） ， 举办了亚洲相互协调和建设信心措施会议（Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia ） 。
It reflects Kazakhstan’s appreciation of the liberal world order into which it was born in 1991 – an order that, at that time, had just received a major boost, with the Soviet Union’s collapse.	这体现出哈萨克斯坦对让它得以在1991年诞生的自由世界秩序的感激之情 — — 当时，这一秩序因为苏联解体而大大增强。
Kazakhstan was never one to settle for being an accepted member of the liberal world order.	哈萨克斯坦从未满足于被自由世界秩序接受。
It wanted to be exemplary, not just joining multilateral regimes and organizations, but also making its own contribution.	它希望成为一个典范 — — 不仅仅加入到多边机制和组织，还要做出自己的贡献。
That is why Kazakhstan sought the chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation (OSCE) in Europe, which it obtained in 2010, and pursued a difficult but ultimately successful campaign to become a non-permanent UN Security Council member in 2017-2018.	因此，哈萨克斯坦寻求成为欧安组织主席国（在2010年如愿 ） ， 并克服万难，最终成功被选为2017—2018年联合国安理会非常人理事国。
Kazakhstan aspires eventually to join the advanced economies in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.	哈萨克斯坦的目标是最终加入发达经济体行列，进入经合组织。
But the international community that Kazakhstan is trying so hard to impress is undergoing fundamental change.	但哈萨克斯坦努力加入的国际社会正在经历更本性变革。
Russia, the great power of Kazakhstan’s neighborhood, has unsettled the region with its invasion of Ukraine, in which it illegally annexed Crimea and started a war in the eastern Donbas region.	哈萨克斯坦的强大邻邦俄罗斯用入侵乌克兰、非法吞并克里米亚并在其东部的顿巴斯发动战争的举动让地区陷入不安。
Compounding the problem, it seems that the United States under President Donald Trump cannot be counted on to continue constraining Russia or underwriting the post-1945 liberal world order that it created.	令问题更加棘手的是，特朗普治下的美国似乎无法继续遏制俄罗斯或支持其一手创造的1945年后的自由世界秩序。
Having ridden to power on a wave of popular anger, Trump can’t even be counted on to follow its rules.	特朗普依靠群众的愤怒赢得权力，因此你甚至不能期望他会遵守规则。
The European Union is similarly beset by internal political challenges – including negotiations with the United Kingdom over its withdrawal from the bloc – that stem from a surge in anti-establishment and nationalist sentiment.	类似地，欧盟也受制于源自反建制和民族主义情绪激昂的内部政治挑战 — — 包括与英国之间的退欧谈判。
China has sought to step into the breach of global leadership – and has been met with surprisingly strong approval from the rest of the world.	中国试图填补全球领导力的空缺 — — 并且出人意料地受到了世界其他国家的高度评价。
Such tectonic shifts are jarring enough for the large powers that bring them about; for smaller countries, they can be even more disorienting.	这些结构性变化足以让造成变化的大国感到震动；对小国来说，这些变化更令它们无所适从。
Even as some welcome the demise of Western hegemony, the fact is that, for a country like Kazakhstan, unpredictability implies danger.	一些人乐于见到西方霸权的衰落，但事实是，对于像哈萨克斯坦这样的国家，不可预见性就意味着危险。
It does not help that the emerging powers are less bound to international human rights norms and conventions, and thus less likely to attempt to enforce them.	新兴强国较少受到国际人权规范和公约的约束，因此不太可能努力执行这些规范和公约，这绝不是有利的情况。
Kazakhstan achieved independence at a time when international cooperation, free trade, and collective security were encouraged, and it has long worked to support these principles.	哈萨克斯坦获得独立时正逢国际合作、自由贸易和集体安全大受鼓舞的时期，长期以来，它也致力于支持这些原则。
Though Kazakhstan’s government, like other young states in the region, has lagged in advancing democracy and human rights, it has at least avoided foreclosing them entirely.	尽管和域内其他年轻国家一样，哈萨克斯坦政府在推动民主和人权方面有所落后，但至少没有完全压制它们。
For now, Kazakhstan is trying to stay the course.	如今，哈萨克斯坦要坚持到底。
But if today’s trends continue, it might lose direction.	但如果现在的趋势持续下去，它可能失去方向。
	
Keeping Africa's Turnaround on Track	把非洲的复兴之路保持下去
MONROVIA – For more than a decade, much of Africa has been moving forward.	发自蒙罗维亚 — — 近十多年以来，大部分非洲国家都取得了进步。
Economic growth is rising, poverty is falling and democratic governance is spreading.	经济增长持续增加，贫困人口不断下降，而民主管治的范围则不断得到延伸。
But the global financial crisis threatens to undo this progress by reducing investment, exports and aid just as they should be expanding to build on these successes.	然而这一进程如今却因全球经济危机而面临中断，因为本应不断扩大以实现上述发展的投资，出口和援助额都残遭削减。
While international attention has been understandably focused on events in Darfur, Somalia and Zimbabwe, countries across the continent including Ghana, Tanzania, Mozambique and Liberia have been quietly turning their economies around.	当国际社会的目光还停留在达尔富尔、索马里和津巴布韦的问题之上时，加纳、坦桑尼亚，莫桑比克和利比里亚等一批非洲国家的经济形势已经悄悄发生了逆转。
Economic growth rates regularly exceed 5% in many nations. The key to this progress is stronger African leadership and more accountable governance.	许多非洲国家的经济增长率一般都会超过5 % ， 而实现这一点的关键则是更有力的非洲人领导和更可靠的政府管治。
Today, more than 20 African countries are democracies, up from just three in the 1980’s.	事实上相较于1980年代非洲只有3个民主国家的尴尬境况，如今已经有超过20个非洲国家实现了民主政治。
They have competitive elections and improved human rights, and a much freer media.	这些国家都拥有更具竞争性的选举，人权也获得了改善，且媒体也更为自由。
These efforts have been supported by increasingly effective development assistance.	而上述进步都是拜逐渐增加的有效发展援助所赐。
Consider what has happened in my country, Liberia.	让我们看看利比里亚所发生的一些情况。
After 14 years of devastating war, we faced enormous challenges.	在持续14年的毁灭性战争中走出来的人们面临着巨大的挑战。
Our democratically elected government has worked with international partners and a growing number of private investors to turn things around.	我国的民选政府因此也连同国际合作伙伴以及接踵而来的私人投资者，大家共同携手希望把局面扭转过来。
In the past three years, we have doubled primary school enrollment nationwide, refurbished hundreds of health facilities, begun rebuilding roads and restoring electricity.	在过去三年中，利比里亚全国的小学生入学率翻了一番，政府还重修了数百所卫生机构，并着手重建道路和电力系统。
We have taken steps to root out corruption and remove unscrupulous officials.	我们也正在逐步根除腐败并撤换品行不良的官员。
Growth has exceeded several percent per year.	全国每年的增长率都要比上一年额外增加了几个百分点。
And, most critical, we are at peace.	更关键的是，我们维持住了和平的局面。
We are restoring our once-vibrant nation, and the crucial component -- hope -- has already been revived.	我们正在重整这个曾经动荡不安的国度，连希望 — — 这个至关紧要的元素 — — 也开始回到了人民心中。
Without international support, we would not have made this progress and would be at much greater risk of returning to war.	而如果没有国际支援的话，我们将难以取得上述的成就，甚至很可能重新沦落到战火当中。
The global economic crisis threatens the progress in my country and elsewhere on our continent.	全球经济危机正威胁着我们国家及其他非洲国家的发展。
Declining remittances from overseas workers, shrinking trade flows and investment could undermine new businesses, throw thousands out of work, and increase tensions and instability. The crisis -- which Africa did nothing to cause -- demands a strong response.	海外劳工汇款减少，贸易和投资资金流的萎缩将威胁到某些新兴行业，导致数千人失业并激发社会矛盾和不稳定性。
African nations must do their part by continuing to address corruption, eliminate red tape and reduce obstacles to private-sector growth.	如果说这场跟非洲完全无关的危机需要得到强而有力回应的话，那么非洲国家必须尽自己的一份努力去杜绝腐败和官僚主义，并减少对私人部门增长所设置的障碍。
But just as industrialized countries need a stimulus, African economies need a boost to keep their progress on track.	但正如发达工业国家需要采取经济刺激计划那样，非洲经济体也需要某些措施去启动经济，以保证整个发展势头得以保持。
The G8 nations meeting in Italy this week have a useful role to play. Among other measures, they must keep their promises to increase aid and make it more effective by reducing bureaucratic delays, speeding disbursements and better aligning programs with African priorities. Effective aid is certainly not the only answer, but it has an increasingly vital role to play as other sources of finance dry up.	本周在意大利举办的8国集团（G8）会议将可以扮演一个有用的角色。 除了其他措施以外，这些国家都必须得遵守它们增加对非洲援助的诺言，并通过减少行政拖延，加速支付程序并以非洲优先的原则来令这些诺言更好地实现。
It is needed to lay the foundations to help stimulate private sector growth.	当然，虽然援助并不是唯一的药方，但当其他经济来源面临枯竭之时它就是最为现实和关键的一环。 而这些援助款项将可以为刺激私人部门增长的计划提供一个坚实的基础。
It would be a cruel irony if, just as Africa begins to succeed, its prospects are cut short by a crisis beyond its control.	如果当非洲在开始走向成功，但它的发展前景却被一场与之无关的危机所荼毒的话，那么整个事件将堪称是一个莫大的讽刺。
Strong action by African governments and robust support from the international community can keep Africa's recovery on track.	非洲的复兴之路只有在非洲国家政府的强有力手段和国际社会源源不断的援助下才能得到保证。
Both must continue to do their part.	而这也意味着双方都必须继续履行好自己的责任，缺一不可。
	
Keep the IMF Out of Europe	IMF不应该介入欧洲事务
BUENOS AIRES – A short-lived rumor recently suggested that the International Monetary Fund was putting together a €600 billion ($803 billion) package for Italy to buy its new government about 18 months to implement the necessary adjustment program.	布宜诺斯艾利斯 — — 最近，一则短命流言说，IMF正在为意大利筹集6000亿欧元资金，目的是给意大利新政府赢得18个月的时间实施必要的调整计划。
Except for the magnitude of the package, this sounds no different from a standard IMF adjustment program – the kind that we are accustomed to seeing (and criticizing) in the developing world.	除了资金规模之外，这一举动与标准的IMF调整计划 — — 那些我们发展中国家早已熟识（和一再批评）的措施 — — 别无二致。
But there is one crucial difference: Italy is part of a select club that does not need outside rescue funds.	但有一个关键不同点：意大利是不需要外部援助资金的精英俱乐部的一员。
So far, programs for the eurozone periphery have been spearheaded and largely financed by European governments, with the IMF contributing financially, but mainly acting as an external consultant – the third party that tells the client the nasty bits while everyone else in the room stares at their shoes.	到目前为止，为欧元区外围国家制定的计划均由欧洲政府牵头并提供主要资金，IMF会在财务上有所支持，但主要扮演外部顾问的角色 — — 即在房间里的所有人都自顾自时告诉客户房间里有恶棍的第三方。
By contrast, the attempt to crowd multilateral resources into Europe was made explicit by eurozone finance ministers’ call in November for IMF resources to be boosted – preferably through debt-generating bilateral loans,– so that it could “cooperate more closely” with the European Financial Stability Facility.	相比之下，欧元区各国财长在11月呼吁IMF增加资源 — — 最好是通过产生债务的双边贷款 — — 以便其“更紧密地”与欧洲金融稳定基金“合作 ” ， 大量向欧洲注入多边资源的想法昭然若揭了。
That means that the short-lived story of Italy’s jumbo IMF package, which was to be funded largely by non-European money, can be regarded as a game changer: while Italy may never receive such a package, Europe, it seems, is determined to resolve its problems using other people’s money.	这意味着短命的IMF意大利融资计划流言 — — 这笔资金将主要来自非欧洲资源 — — 可视为博弈变化器：意大利也许永远不会收到这笔钱，但欧洲似乎已下定决心要用他人的钱来解决自己的问题。
There are at least three reasons why the IMF should resist this pressure, and abstain from increasing its (already extremely high) exposure to Europe.	IMF至少有三大理由抵制这一要求，并拒绝增加其（已然极高的）对欧洲的风险暴露。
First, and most obviously, Europe already has its own in-house lender of last resort.	首先，也是最为显而易见的是，欧洲已经有了其自身的最后贷款人。
The European Central Bank can make available all the euros needed to backstop Italy’s debt.	欧洲央行可以提供支撑意大利债务所需要的所有欧元。
And printing them would only offset, through mild inflation, the effects of the otherwise Draconian relative price adjustment that is taking place under the corset of the common currency.	印刷这笔钱将通过温和通胀抵消替代方案 — — 在共同货币的束缚下所发生的严厉的相对价格调整 — — 的影响。
So it is puzzling that some observers have saluted the IMF’s involvement as a virtuous effort by the international community to bring the listing European ship to port.	因此，某些观察者赞扬IMF的介入行为，称其为国际社会力助欧洲巨船不沉的善举，这实在令人奇怪。
Why should the IMF (or, for that matter, the international community) do for Europe what Europe can but does not want to do for Italy?	为何IMF（或国际社会）应该替欧洲帮助欧洲能够而不愿意帮助的意大利？
Why should international money be mobilized to pay for European governance failures?	为何要动员国际资金为欧洲治理失买单？
And if, as appears to be the case, Germany is playing a dangerous game of chicken with some of its eurozone partners, why should the cost be shifted to the IMF for the benefit of Europe’s largest and most successful economy?	此外，正如实际情形所显示的，如果德国是在和其欧元区伙伴玩一场危险的胆小鬼博弈，那么为何要把成本转移给IMF，而使欧洲最大最成功的经济体获益？
Letting the ECB off the hook in this manner would simply validate for Europe as a whole the same moral hazard feared by German and other leaders who oppose ECB intervention.	用这种方式让欧洲央行脱身只能将整个欧洲置于德国和其他反对欧元区干预的领导人所担心的道德风险之中。
The second reason to avoid IMF intervention in Europe is that lending to a potentially insolvent country has serious implications for the Fund.	避免IMF干预欧洲的第二个理由是，向本质上已经破产的国家提供贷款会对IMF造成严重影响。
For starters, taking the IMF’s preferred-creditor status at face value, an IMF loan would entail substituting its “non-defaultable” debt for “defaultable” debt with private bondholders, because the Fund’s money is used primarily to service outstanding bonds.	从IMF的优先债权人地位看，IMF贷款将意味着用其“不可违约”债务替代私人债权人的“可违约”债务，因为IMF的资金将首先用于��还现有债务。
As a result, a group of lucky bondholders would be bailed out at the expense of those that became junior to IMF debt and remained highly exposed to a likely restructuring.	结果，幸运的债权人将得到援助，但这是以那些沦为低于IMF债务一等且仍需面临重组风险的债权人的牺牲为代价的。
Since a “haircut” can be imposed only on whatever is left of the defaultable private debt, the larger the IMF share, the deeper the haircut needed to restore sustainability.	因为损失只会落到可违约的私人债务头上（取决于偿还了IMF债务之后还有多少资金能够偿还这些债务 ） ， 因此IMF债务的比重越大，重建可持续性所需的损失就越深。
For the same reason, IMF loans can be a burdensome legacy from a market perspective.	出于同样的理由，IMF贷款可能被市场视为负担。
Because they represent a massive senior claim, they may discourage new private lending for many years to come.	由于它们代表着巨额的优先求偿权，因此将在多年内抑制新的私人贷款。
This brings us to the third reason why the IMF should stay out of Europe’s crisis: what if Fund seniority fails?	由此产生了IMF应该之身欧洲事务之外的第三大理由：IMF债务失去了优先地位会怎样？
The implicit preferred-creditor status is based on central-bank practices that establish that the lender of last resort is the “last in and first out.”	默认的优选债权人地位是建立在确定最后贷款人“后进先出”的央行行为的基础上的。
It is this seniority that enables the IMF to limit the risk of default so that it can lend to countries at reasonable interest rates when nobody else will.	这一优先地位使得IMF得以限制违约风险，从而让其以合理利率在找不到其他贷款者的情况下向各国提供贷款。
This works when the IMF’s share of a country’s debt is small, and the country has sufficient resources to service it.	这只有在IMF贷款占一国债务比重较低时、且该国有足够资源偿还IMF贷款时才有效。
But seniority is not written in stone: poor economies that are unable to repay even the IMF are eligible for debt reduction under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries program, and 35 have received it since the program was established in 1996.	但这一优先地位并非铁板一块：连IMF贷款都无力偿还的贫困经济体可以获得在重债穷国（Heavily Indebted Poor Countries）计划的框架下进行债务削减的资格，自该计划于1996年实施以来，共有35个国家走过这一程序。
What would happen if, in five years, Italy were heavily indebted to the IMF?	如果5年后意大利成为对IMF的重债国会怎么样？
What if private debt represented a share so small that no haircut would restore sustainability, forcing multilateral lenders to pitch in with some debt relief?	如果私人债务的比例是如此之低，以至于损失再大也无法重塑可持续性，逼迫多边贷款人接受某种程度的债务豁免会怎么样？
The IMF’s seniority is an unwritten principle, sustained in a delicate equilibrium, and high-volume lending is testing the limit.	IMF的优先地位并没有写成白纸黑字，只能在微妙的均衡中得以维持，大额贷款在考验它的极限。
From this perspective, the proposal to use the IMF as a conduit for ECB resources (thereby circumventing restrictions imposed by European Union’s treaties), while providing the ECB with preferred-creditor status, would exacerbate the Fund’s exposure to risky borrowers.	从这一点看，将IMF用作欧洲央行资源管道（从而绕过欧盟条约的限制 ） ， 同时给予欧洲央行有限债权人地位，将增加IMF对高风险借款人的风险暴露。
This arrangement could be seen as an unwarranted abuse of Fund seniority that, in addition, unfairly frees the ECB from the need to impose its own conditionality on one of its members.	这一安排可视为对IMF的无保险措施的滥用，也不公平地让欧洲央行逃脱了制约某个成员的需要。
It makes little sense for the international community to assume that unnecessary risk.	国际社会没有必要假设非必须的风险。
Let us hope that the IMF’s non-European stakeholders will be able to contain the pressure.	但愿IMF的非欧洲相关利益方能够顶住压力。
The solution for Europe is not IMF money, but its own.	欧洲的问题不应该由IMF的资金解决，它们必须自力更生。
	
The Noose Tightens	索套收紧
WASHINGTON, DC – Even with a new minder trying to bring some order to the White House, President Donald Trump remains in a heap of trouble.	华盛顿—特朗普即使有心要让白宫井然有序，也要面对一系列麻烦。
The recent installation of retired Marine Corps general John Kelly, formerly Trump’s Secretary for Homeland Security, as Chief of Staff, replacing the hapless Reince Priebus, has reduced some of the internal chaos and induced a bit more discipline in Trump’s behavior.	最近，特朗普任命他的前国土安全部部长、退役陆军上将约翰·凯利（John Kelly）为幕僚长，以取代倒霉的伦斯·普里巴斯（Reince Priebus ） ， 此举在一定程度上遏制了内部混乱，也给特朗普的行为带来了更多的纪律性。
But all this could change any day, or at any moment.	但所有这一切都有可能在一夜之间，甚至一眨眼间发生变化。
Kelly has put a stop to aides sauntering into the Oval Office whenever they felt like it – Trump tends to echo the last person he’s spoken with – and has demanded that papers and memos for the president be submitted to him first.	凯利已经禁止特朗普的助手随时随地进入椭圆办公室 — — 特朗普总是接受最后一个与他交谈的人的意见 — — 并要求呈递给总统的文本和备忘录先经他过目。
For the time being, at least, the president’s tweeting has been reduced in number and nuttiness.	至少现在特朗普的推特已不再像过去那样频繁而疯狂了。
Keen Trump observers expect that he’ll soon begin to chafe under the discipline Kelly has encouraged.	急不可耐的特朗普观察员们期待他很快就会厌烦凯利的雷厉风行。
Understanding Trump’s enormous ego, Kelly is said to encourage gently rather than instruct.	凯利十分清楚特朗普的膨胀的自我，据说他推行纪律的方式是通过礼貌而不是指令。
Kelly also has the advantage of Trump’s high regard for generals.	凯利还拥有一个优势：特朗普很看重将军。
But Trump could well become incensed by news stories praising Kelly for bringing order to the White House.	但特朗普可能会因为表扬凯利给白宫带来秩序的报道而大发雷霆。
(Counselor Steve Bannon never fully recovered in the president’s esteem after he was on the cover of Time magazine soon after the inauguration.)	（白宫顾问史蒂夫·班农（Steve Bannon）自从特朗普就职典礼后不久上了《时代》杂志的封面，就再也没有赢得总统的充分尊重。 ）
Meanwhile, Trump’s poll ratings are lower than ever – and the lowest of any president at such an early point in an administration.	与此同时，特朗普的支持率下降到了新低 — — 也是所有总统在执政早期的最低水平。
Members of his own Republican Party are distancing themselves from him.	在他本人所在的共和党内，党员们纷纷与他保持距离。
The recent failure of the Republican-dominated Congress to repeal Barack Obama’s signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act, which made health care available for millions of people who previously couldn’t afford it, was a humiliating defeat for Trump.	共和党占多数的国会最近没有能够推翻奥巴马的标志性成就 — — 平价医疗法（ACA ） ， 这特朗普的一次耻辱性惨败。 ACA让数百万此前无力承担医保的美国人能够获得医保。
Just enough Republican senators (three, but more were in reserve if needed) voted to reject the last of several efforts to fulfill the party’s vow to replace “Obamacare.”	恰到好处的共和党参议员（三人，但如果需要的话，会有更多人“反水 ” ） 投票拒绝了共和党最后一次承诺取代“奥巴马医保”的议案。
That nickname for the ACA, coined by the Republicans when the law was enacted in early 2010, was intended to be derogatory, and their opposition to the program seemed to be vindicated in that year’s midterm elections, when they swept both houses of congress.	ACA的这个外号正是共和党在该法案于2010年初实施时所起，原本含有贬义，他们对该计划的反对也在当年举行的中期选举（共和党在国会两院赢得压倒性胜利）中得到了印证。
But the Republicans didn’t reckon on two things: that as people gained access to health insurance (some 20 million by this year), it became popular – as did Obama, who ended his second term as one of America’s most liked presidents.	但共和党没有料到两件事：随着人们获得了医保（到今年为止有2,000万人 ） ， ACA也变得日益受到欢迎 — — 奥巴马也是如此，第二个任期结束时，他已经跻身美国最受喜爱的总统之一。
Over Obama’s tenure, Republicans came to realize that it was no longer sufficient simply to call for a repeal of Obamacare, and their rhetoric shifted to the need to “repeal and replace.”	奥巴马执政期间，共和党开始认识到，仅仅要求取消奥巴马医保是不够的，他们的口风也变为要“取消并取代 ” 。
They held more than 50 roll-call votes saying that they’d do just that, knowing that it didn’t really matter because Obama would veto any serious repeal.	他们进行了不下50次唱名投票（roll-call votes）说明他们就是要这样做，但十分清楚这其实没有什么用，因为奥巴马会否决一切严肃的取消议案。
The roll calls were actually fundraisers: appeals to the unsuspecting Republican base to send money to keep up the fight against the supposedly hated program.	唱名投票实际上是为了筹集资金：号召毫不怀疑的共和党票仓贡献资金以保持反抗这个据说是饱受厌憎的计划。
But when the 2016 election put a Republican in the White House, the party’s congressional leaders had nowhere to hide.	但当2016年大选让共和党入主白宫时，共和党的国会领袖们便无处可藏了。
The Republicans were now in full control of the government – and they hadn’t a clue about what should replace Obamacare.	如今，共和党完全控制了政府 — — 并没有拿出应该如何取代奥巴马医保的方案来。
At the end of six months in office, Trump doesn’t have a single legislative achievement to crow about (though he has claimed the Senate’s approval of Neil Gorsuch as a new Supreme Court justice as a victory).	执政六个月后，特朗普还没有一项立法成就值得宣扬（尽管他宣称参议院批准尼尔·哥萨奇（Neil Gorsuch）为新的最高法院法官是一场胜利 ） 。
Significantly, Senate Republican leaders ignored Trump’s demand that they take up repeal and replace of Obamacare again, before they consider any other major issue.	令人瞩目的是，参议院共和党领袖们根本无视特朗普要他们在考虑任何重大议题之前，先再次着手取消和取代奥巴马医保的要求。
While the health-care bill was commanding most of the attention on Capitol Hill, another piece of legislation was moving along in the Congress, representing another setback for Trump.	尽管医保法案占据了国会山的大部分精力，还有一项立法也在国会走了一遭，而特朗普再次遭受打击。
Troubled by the president’s apparent soft spot for (or perhaps fear of) Vladimir Putin, overwhelming bipartisan majorities in both chambers passed a bill to impose more sanctions on Russia and – most unusually – to prevent the president from lifting any such penalties.	显然，总统对普京立场偏软（甚至可能有些畏惧 ） ， 受此影响，国会两院两党以压倒性多数通过了一项法案，加强对俄制裁，并 — — 反常地 — — 阻止总统取消一切惩罚。
And, because the bill passed with enough votes to override a presidential veto, Trump had little choice but to sign it, which he did in private, without the customary presence of a bill’s sponsors and the press.	此外，该法案获得赞成票数足以推翻总统的否决权，因此特朗普别无选择，只能签署它，他也低调地这么做了，并没有按照惯例邀请法案发起人和媒体在场。
Meanwhile, the investigation into Trump and his campaign’s relations with Russia in connection with its meddling in Trump’s favor in the 2016 election has continued out of the public’s sight.	与此同时，对特朗普及其选战阵营与俄罗斯的关系如何对特朗普的2016年总统竞选形成了有利影响的调查，仍然在公众的视线之外进行。
That investigation has broadened to include Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and his son Donald Jr.	该调查的范围有所扩大，特朗普的女婿贾雷德·库什纳（Jared Kushner）和他的儿子小唐纳德都已经受到牵连。
This spring, Trump let it be known that he wanted the special counsel running that investigation, Robert Mueller, a former FBI director who is highly respected by both parties, to be fired.	今年春天，特朗普公开表示他想解雇负责调查的特别检察官罗伯特·穆勒（Robert Mueller ） 。 身为前联邦调查局局长，穆勒在两党中间都拥有崇高的威望。
He’d already fired FBI director James Comey, but by law, he couldn’t fire Mueller himself, so he tried to bully Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had (appropriately) recused himself from the investigation, into resigning.	他已经解雇了联邦调查局局长詹姆斯·科米（James Comey ） ， 但根据法律，他本人不能解雇穆勒，因此他试图胁迫司法部长 、 （ 合理地）将自己与调查撇清了关系的杰夫·塞申斯（Jeff Sessions）辞职。
That way, Trump could appoint a replacement who would fire Mueller.	这样，特朗普就可以任命一位新的司法部长，让他来解雇穆勒。
But Sessions, the first Republican senator to endorse Trump, was enjoying rolling back numerous Obama-era protections in areas like civil rights, and refused to resign.	但塞申斯作为第一位支持特朗普的共和党参议员，正在十分愉快地取消公民权利等领域的大量奥巴马时代的保护法令，拒绝辞职。
Several of Sessions’ former Senate colleagues also demanded that Trump back off.	塞申斯的几位前参议员同事也要求特朗普收回成命。
Though Kelly called Sessions to tell him that his job was safe, Republican senators, concerned that Trump might remove him during the August recess, established a procedure that would prevent Trump from appointing an interim attorney-general to fire Mueller, and warned that such a move would provoke a constitutional crisis.	尽管凯利打致电塞申斯，告诉他他的位置安全，但共和党参议员们担心特朗普可能会在8月份休假期间取而代之，因此制定了一套流程防止特朗普任命一位过渡司法部长来解雇穆勒，并警告这样的举动将导致宪政危机。
Then, as Congress prepared to leave for the August recess, it was learned that Mueller – who had hired highly regarded prosecutors specializing in international financial transactions, despite Trump’s warnings not to investigate his finances – had impaneled a grand jury in Washington.	然后，就在国会散会迎接8月假期的时候，穆勒 — — 他招募了专长于国际金融交易的德高望重的检察官，尽管特朗普警告不要调查他的财务状况 — — 已经在华盛顿确定了大陪审团名单。
The noose tightens.	索套收紧了。
	
Northern Europe’s Drag on the World Economy	北欧对世界经济的拖累
MADRID – In recent years, China’s current-account surpluses – which have averaged almost $220 billion annually since 2000 – have attracted much criticism from the rest of the world.	马德里—近几年来，中国的经常项目赤字 — — 自2000年以来平均每年可达近2200亿美元 — — 招致世界其他国家的猛烈批评。
But Germany’s similar-size surpluses – which have averaged about $170 billion since the euro’s introduction in 1999 – have, until recently, largely escaped scrutiny.	但德国的盈余与中国规模相当 — — 自1999年引入欧元以来平均每年1700亿美元 — — 却一直没有引起多少关注，直到最近才有所改变。
The difference, it was argued, was monetary union.	人们指出，区别就在于货币联盟。
So long as the eurozone as a whole was relatively balanced, Germany’s surpluses were considered irrelevant – just as, say, Texas’s surpluses have never been considered an issue in the United States.	只要欧元区作为一个整体相对平衡，德国的盈余就被视为无关紧要 — — 正如（比如）得克萨斯州的盈余从来不会被认为是美国的问题。
Chinese surpluses, by contrast, were seen as a cause of global imbalances.	相反，中国的盈余被视为全球失衡的源头之一。
This argument is correct in the sense that it is the current-account surplus or deficit of a monetary union as a whole that can be expected to have exchange-rate implications.	作为整体的货币联盟的经常项目盈余或赤字可以预期带来汇率影响，从这一点上看，区别对待中国和德国是正确的。
And, unlike China, Germany no longer has a “national” exchange rate that can adjust in response to its current-account surplus.	此外，与中国不同，德国不再拥有可以根据经常项目盈余调整的“国家”汇率。
These factors – together with the lack of trade data for regions within countries – have led economists only rarely to consider countries’ internal surpluses or deficits.	这些因素 — — 以及缺少国家内地区的贸易数据 — — 导致经济学家很少考虑国家内部的盈余或赤字。
But, in net terms, a region within a country – or, like Germany, a country or sub-region within a monetary union – still “subtracts” from national and global aggregate demand if it exports more than it imports.	但是，从净值角度讲，一国内部地区 — — 或者向德国那样的货币联盟内部的一国或次级地区 — — 如果出口多于进口，仍然是国家或全球总需求的“减少”项。
Witness how expenditure cuts by US state governments – many of which are constitutionally required to balance their budgets – frustrated, to some degree, America’s massive federal-government stimulus in 2010-2011.	看看2010—2011年间美国州政府 — — 根据宪法，许多州政府必须平衡预算 — — 的减支如何在一定程度上阻碍了联邦政府的大规模刺激。
For this reason, it is relevant to ask whether a country as large as Germany – or even a large state like California or Texas – augments or depletes global aggregate demand.	出于这个原因，有必要问一问，像德国这样的大国 — — 甚或像加州或得州这样的大州 — — 增加还是减少了全球总需求。
(In fact, as sovereign countries, California and Texas would have been the world’s 12th and 14th largest economies, respectively, in 2012 – ahead of the Netherlands, Mexico, and South Korea.)	（事实上，若作为主权国家，加州和得州分别是2012年世界第12大和第14大经济体，位于荷兰、墨西哥和韩国之前。 ）
That question is all the more important, because the Netherlands and Austria, two of Germany’s Northern European eurozone neighbors, continue to run current-account surpluses, while the Southern European crisis countries have reversed their previously large deficits, as austerity has squeezed domestic demand and made room for an increase in exports.	这一问题非常重要，因为德国的两个北欧欧元区邻国 — — 荷兰和奥地利一直有经常项目盈余，而随着紧缩挤压了内需、为出口增长创造了空间，南欧危机国也扭转了此前的巨额赤字。
As a result, the eurozone as a whole will produce a surplus close to $260 billion this year, which represents a new global imbalance that is more directly comparable to China’s in the past decade.	结果，欧元区作为一个整体今年将有近2600亿美元的盈余，这将带来可以与过去十年的中国直接比较的新的全球失衡。
Europe’s non-eurozone surplus countries – Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, and Norway (all of which tie their exchange rates to the euro to some degree) – magnify this global imbalance.	欧洲的非欧元区盈余国 — — 瑞典、丹麦、瑞士和挪威（所有这些国家都在一定程度上将汇率盯住欧元 ） — —放大了这一全球失衡。
Northern Europe – including these four countries and Germany, the Netherlands, and Austria – is running a massive current-account surplus of about $550 billion.	北欧 — — 包括上述四国和德国、荷兰和奥地利 — — 的经常项目盈余高达5500亿美元。
Meanwhile, China’s surplus is unlikely to exceed $150 billion this year.	与此同时，中国的盈余今年不可能超过1500亿美元。
In fact, the highest level that China’s annual surplus has ever reached was around $400 billion in 2007-2008 – when the US was poised to introduce trade sanctions against the country, because it viewed this imbalance as a threat to the stability of the US and the world economy.	事实上，中国年度盈余的最高水平为2007—2008年间的4000亿美元左右，当时美国甚至意欲对中国采取贸易制裁，因为它认为这一失衡已威胁到美国和世界经济的稳定。
What is most problematic about the eurozone’s situation is that unemployment in some of the crisis countries – Spain and Greece – remains above 20%.	欧元区局面问题最大的地方在于一些危机国 — — 西班牙和希腊 — — 的失业率仍在20%以上。
These countries are trying to achieve a difficult “internal devaluation” – that is, a reduction in their domestic unit labor costs relative to the eurozone’s stronger economies – while the overall eurozone surplus caused by Northern Europe puts upward pressure on the exchange rate, undermining their competitiveness outside the monetary union.	这些国家正在试图实现艰难的“内部贬值 ” ， 即降低其相对于欧元区坚挺经济体的国内单位劳动力成本，但北欧造成的欧元区整体盈余给汇率造成了升值压力，破坏了它们在欧元区之外的竞争力。
Spain and Greece have managed to achieve an internal devaluation of about 5% this year vis-à-vis Germany, but their competitiveness vis-à-vis the US and dollar-linked countries has not improved, because the euro has appreciated by more than 5% against the dollar.	西班牙和希腊在今年设法实现了约5%的（相对德国的）内部贬值，但它们相对美国和美元相关国家的竞争力并未得到改善，因为欧元相对美元升值了5%以上。
And, indeed, the euro should appreciate, because the eurozone as a whole is now running a large current-account surplus.	事实上，欧元应该升值，因为欧元区作为一个整体存在巨大的经常项目盈余。
One can only pity the Southern European countries.	我们只能对南欧国家表示同情。
They should almost thank the French for their inability to impose effective austerity measures and thereby still run a small current-account deficit, which has prevented the eurozone surplus from becoming even larger.	它们应该感谢法国，因为法国没能采取有效的紧缩措施，因此仍保持经常项目略有赤字的状态，阻止了欧元区盈余的进一步扩大。
But an abundance of pity alone will not help.	但光有同情泛滥无济于事。
Northern European countries, which have ample room to increase wages and implement expansionary policies, must do so.	北欧国家有充足的空间提高工资和实施扩张性政策，也必须这样做。
This would directly benefit Northern European citizens themselves, while helping to keep the euro down and stimulate growth and adjustment in Southern Europe and the global economy as a whole.	这将直接有利于北欧公民本身，同时有助于拉低欧元币值，刺激南欧和整个全球经济的增长和调整。
	
Tailspin or Turbulence?	永久坠落还是暂时危机？
WASHINGTON, DC – Since the beginning of the year, a new wave of doubt has engulfed emerging markets, driving down their asset prices.	发自华盛顿特区 — — 自年初以来，新一轮的质疑声淹没了新兴市场，导致这些国家的资产价格下跌。
The initial wave struck in the spring of 2013, following the Federal Reserve’s announcement that it would begin “tapering” its monthly purchases of long-term assets, better known as quantitative easing (QE).	第一波冲击始于2013年春季，当时美联储宣布将开始“逐渐削减”每月的长期资产收购数额（即所谓的量化宽松 ） 。
Now that the taper has arrived, the emerging-market bears are ascendant once again.	如今削减如约而至，新兴市场的熊市也再度降临。
Pressure has been strongest on the so-called “Fragile Five”: Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa, and Turkey (not counting Argentina, where January’s mini-crisis started).	其中压力最大的是所谓“脆弱五国 ” — —巴西、印度、印尼，南非以及土耳其（1月份爆发小型危机的阿根廷并未计算在内 ） 。
But worries have extended to other emerging economies, too.	但忧虑情绪也已蔓延到了其他新兴市场国家。
Will the Fed’s gradual reduction of QE bring with it more emerging-market problems this year?	美联储逐渐缩减量化宽松的行动是否在今年催生更多的新兴市场危机？
To what extent are today’s conditions comparable to those that triggered the Asian crisis of 1997 or other abrupt capital-flow reversals in recent decades?	相比于导致1997年亚洲金融危机或其他突发性资本外流事件，当今的状况究竟处于何种程度？
Emerging-market bulls point out that most major middle-income countries have substantially lowered their public debt/GDP ratios, giving them fiscal space that they lacked in the past.	新兴市场的牛市表明大多数主要中等收入国家都已经切实降低了自身的公共负债/GDP比率，并使之获得了过去所缺少的财政空间。
But neither the Mexican “Tequila crisis” of 1994 nor the Asian crisis of 1997 was caused by large public deficits.	但无论是1994年墨西哥的“龙舌兰危机”还是1997亚洲金融风暴都并非由公共负债所引发。
In both cases, the effort to defend a fixed exchange rate in the face of capital-flow reversals was a major factor, as was true in Turkey in the year prior to its currency collapse in February 2001.	在两起事件中，在面对资本外流时试图维护固定汇率的举措才是主要原因，而2001年二月土耳其货币崩盘前一年的情况也是如此。
Today, most emerging countries not only have low public-debt burdens, but also seem committed to flexible exchange rates, and appear to have well-capitalized banks, regulated to limit foreign-exchange exposure.	如今，大多数新兴市场国家不仅公共债务负担较低，同时似乎都实行浮动汇率，而且国内银行资本充足，并施行监管以限制外汇风险。
Why, then, has there been so much vulnerability?	但为什么它们依然会如此脆弱？
To be sure, the weakest-looking emerging countries have large current-account deficits and low net central-bank reserves after deducting short-term debt from gross reserves.	无可否认，那些看上去最为脆弱的新兴市场国家都有着巨额经常帐户逆差，同时在总储备扣除短期债务后的，这些国家中央银行的净储备也所剩无几。
But one could argue that if there is a capital-flow reversal, the exchange rate would depreciate, causing exports of goods and services to increase and imports to decline; the resulting current-account adjustment would quickly reduce the need for capital inflows.	但有人也会说：如果存在资本外流的话那么汇率将会下降，导致商品和服务的出口增加而进口减少；那么随后的经常帐户调整将很快减少国家对资本流入的依赖。
Given fiscal space and solid banks, a new equilibrium would quickly be established.	既然存在一定财政回旋空间而且银行较为稳固，那么一个新的均衡状态将会很快建立起来。
Unfortunately, the real vulnerability of some countries is rooted in private-sector balance sheets, with high leverage accumulating in both the household sector and among non-financial firms.	不幸的是，对于某些国家来说，真正的弱点其实是在私人部门的资产负债表上，家庭和非金融企业都承担着极高的金融杠杆。
Moreover, in many cases, the corporate sector, having grown accustomed to taking advantage of cheap funds from abroad to finance domestic activities, has significant foreign-currency exposure.	此外在许多情况下，那些逐渐依赖利用廉价外国资金来发展国内业务的企业部���也会暴露在极大的外汇风险之下。
Where that is the case, steep currency depreciation would bring with it serious balance-sheet problems, which, if large enough, would undermine the banking sector, despite strong capital cushions.	在这种情况下，汇率暴跌将引发严重的资产负债表风险，一旦危机发展到一定程度就将波及银行系统，即便拥有强大的资本作缓冲都将无济于事。
Banking-sector problems would, in turn, require state intervention, causing the public-debt burden to rise.	而银行部门危机将转而需要政府介入，导致公共债务上升。
In an extreme case, a “Spanish” scenario could unfold (though without the constraint of a fixed exchange rate, as in the eurozone).	在极端的情况下，就会出现类似“西班牙式”的境况（虽然不存在欧元区那样的固定汇率限制 ） 。
It is this danger that sets a practical and political limit to flexible exchange rates.	而这也是为什么要为浮动汇率设定一个实用性和政治性的限制。
Some depreciation can be managed by most of the deficit countries; but a vicious circle could be triggered if the domestic currency loses too much value too quickly.	有些贬值能被大多数赤字国家掌控；但如果本地货币过快且过大幅度贬值的话就会激发一个不断恶化的循环。
Private-sector balance-sheet problems would weaken the financial sector, and the resulting pressure on public finances would compel austerity, thereby constraining consumer demand – and causing further damage to firms’ balance sheets.	私人部门资产负债表问题将削弱金融部门，而因此对公共财政所产生的压力又会迫使出台紧缩措施，进而压制消费者需求 — — 从而令企业资产负债表进一步恶化。
To prevent such a crisis, therefore, the exchange rate has to be managed – and in a manner that depends on a country’s specific circumstances.	为了防止这一危机，就必须对汇率进行管理 — — 并按照每个国家的特殊国情行事。
Large net central-bank reserves can help ease the process.	庞大的央行净外汇储备将有助于舒缓这一进程。
Otherwise, a significant rise in interest rates must be used to retain short-term capital and allow more gradual real-sector adjustment.	此外，必须大幅提升利率以留住短期资金并允许实体部门进行更为渐进式的调整。
Higher interest rates will of course lead to slower growth and lower employment, but such costs are likely to be smaller than those of a full-blown crisis.	虽然高利率必然导致增长放缓以及失业率增高，但这些成本都将比一场大危机所带来的成本更低。
The challenge is more difficult for countries with very large current-account deficits.	而那些拥有大量经常账户逆差的国家面临的挑战则更严峻。
And it becomes harder still if political turmoil or tension is thrown into the mix, as has been the case recently in a surprisingly large number of countries.	一旦与政治风暴/紧张局势结合起来则境况会更糟，令人震惊的是最近有一大批国家都出现了这种状况。
Nonetheless, despite serious dangers for a few countries, an overall emerging-market crisis is unlikely in 2014.	虽然如此，但即便有一些国家目前正在水深火热之中，在2014年不太可能爆发一场新兴市场全面危机。
Actual capital-flow reversals have been very limited, and no advanced country will raise interest rates sharply; in fact, with the United States’ current-account deficit diminishing, net flows from the US have increased over the last 12 months.	实际的资金外流极为有限，也没有发达经济体国家大幅提高利率；事实上，随着美国的经常账户赤字不断缩减，来自美国的净资本流入在过去12个月内不断增加。
Moreover, most emerging-market countries have strong enough fiscal positions and can afford flexible enough exchange rates to manage a non-disruptive adjustment to moderately higher global interest rates.	与此同时，大多数新兴市场国家拥有足够强大的财政实力，也有足够的汇率变化空间去实现一场非破坏性的调整以应对适度提升的全球利率。
Much of the recent turmoil reflects the growing realization that financial-asset prices worldwide have been inflated by extraordinarily expansionary monetary policies.	最近的大部分危机都反映出人们逐渐认识到全球的金融资产价格都是由极端的扩张性货币政策所导致的。
As a result, many financial assets have become vulnerable to even minor shifts in sentiment, and this will continue until real interest rates approach more “normal” long-run levels.	结果许多金融资产变得如此脆弱，以致一点情绪的波动都难以承受，而这种情况将持续到实际利率接近更“正常”的长期水平为止。
In the medium term, however, the potential for technological catch-up growth and secular convergence remains strong in most emerging countries.	但在中期看来，大多数新兴经济体实现科技赶超以及长期缩小（与发达经济体）差距的潜力依然强大。
The pace of a country’s convergence will depend, even more than in the past, on the quality of governance and the pace of structural reforms.	而一个国家缩小差距的步伐将取决于政府治理的质量以及结构性改革的步伐，而且这两点比过往更加重要。
	
The Great Income Divide	收入大分化
WASHINGTON, DC – Thomas Piketty’s book Capital in the Twenty-First Century has captured the world’s attention, putting the relationship between capital accumulation and inequality at the center of economic debate.	华盛顿—托马斯·皮克提（Thomas Piketty）的书《二十一世纪资本论 》 （ Capital in the Twenty-First Century）吸引了全世界的注意，让资本积累与不平等性的关系成为经济争论的中心。
What makes Piketty’s argument so special is his insistence on a fundamental trend stemming from the very nature of capitalist growth.	皮克提的观点如此特殊，是因为他坚持认为资本主义增长的内在性质到这了一个基本趋势。
It is an argument much in the tradition of the great economists of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.	这一论断遵循了十九世纪和二十世纪早期伟大经济学家的传统。
In an age of tweets, his bestseller falls just short of a thousand pages.	在这个微博时代，他写出了一本厚达近千页的畅销书。
The book’s release follows more than a decade of painstaking research by Piketty and others, including Oxford University’s Tony Atkinson.	本书是皮克提和包括牛津大学的托尼·阿特金森（Tony Atkinson）在内的多人多年苦心研究的结果。
There were minor problems with the treatment of the massive data set, particularly the measurement of capital incomes in the United Kingdom.	其中包括一些处理超大数据集，特别是如何测量英国资本收入的小问题。
But the long-term trends identified – a rise in capital owners’ share of income and the concentration of “primary income” (before taxes and transfers) at the very top of the distribution in the United States and other major economies – remain unchallenged.	但他们所识别的长期趋势 — — 美国和其他主要经济体资本所有者占收入比例上升以及“初级收入 ” （ 税收和转移支付前收入）集中于收入分配最顶层 — — 是不容置疑的。
The law of diminishing returns leads one to expect the return on each additional unit of capital to decline.	回报递减定律让我们知道，每一新增单位资本的回报是递减的。
A key to Piketty’s results is that in recent decades the return to capital has diminished, if at all, proportionately much less than the rate at which capital has been growing, thereby leading to an increasing share of capital income.	皮克提的结论的一个关键是，最近几十年来资本的递减（如有）远远低于资本成长速度，从而导致资本收入占比上升。
Within the framework of textbook microeconomic theory, this happens when the “elasticity of substitution” in the production function is greater than one: capital can be substituted for labor, imperfectly, but with a small enough decline in the rate of return so that the share of capital increases with greater capital intensity.	在微观经济教材框架中，这一现象发生于生产函数的“替代弹性”大于1时发生：资本可以用劳动力不完美地替代，但回报率下降幅度很小，因此资本占比会随着资本密集度的增加而增加。
Larry Summers recently argued that in a dynamic context, the evidence for elasticity of substitution greater than one is weak if one measures the return net of depreciation, because depreciation increases proportionately with the growth of the capital stock.	拉里·萨默斯（Larry Summers）最近指出，在动态环境中，如果你考察折旧的净回报，会发现替代弹性大于1的证据很弱，因为折旧会随资本存量的增加而成比例地增加。
But traditional elasticity of substitution measures the ease of substitution with a given state of technical knowledge.	但传统替代弹性测量的是给定技术知识状态下的替代的容易程度。
If there is technical change that saves on labor, the result over time looks similar to what high elasticity of substitution would produce.	如果发生节约劳动力的技术变化，随时间发生的变化就会类似于高替代弹性情形。
In fact, just a few months ago, Summers himself proposed a reformulation of the production function that distinguished between traditional capital (K1), which remains, to some degree, a complement to labor (L), and a new kind of capital (K2), which would be a perfect substitute for L.	事实上，在几个月前，萨默斯本人提出了一个改进的生产函数公式，该公式区分传统资本（K1，在某种程度上仍属于劳动（L）的互补要素）和新型资本（K2，是L的完美替代要素 ） 。
An increase in K2 would lead to increases in output, the rate of return to K1, and capital’s share of total income.	K2的增加将导致产出、K1回报率和资本占总收入比的增加。
At the same time, increasing the amount of “effective labor” – that is, K2 + L – would push wages down.	与此同时 ， “ 有效劳动 ” （ 即K2+L）的增加会促使工资下降。
This would be true even if the elasticity of substitution between K1 and aggregate effective labor were less than one.	即使在K1和总有效劳动之间的替代弹性小于1时，这一结论也成立。
Until recently not much capital could be classified as K2, with machines that could substitute for labor doing so far from perfectly.	此前，可归于K2的资本很少，机器对劳动力的替代远远称不上完美。
But, with the rise of “intelligent” machines and software, K2’s share of total capital is growing.	但是，随着“智能”机器和软件的崛起，K2占总资本之比正在上升。
Oxford University’s Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne estimate that such machines eventually could perform roughly 47% of existing jobs in the US.	牛津大学的卡尔·本尼迪克特·弗雷（Carl Benedikt Frey）和迈克尔·奥斯本（Michael Osborne）估算，这些机器最终将取代大约47%的美国现有岗位。
If that is true, the aggregate share of capital is bound to increase.	果真如此的话，资本总比重必然会上升。
Given that capital ownership remains concentrated among those with high incomes, the share of income going to the very top of the distribution also will rise.	由于资本所有权仍集中在高收入群体，因此流向分配最顶层的收入占比也会上升。
The tendency of these capital owners to save a large proportion of their income – and, in many cases, not to have a large number of children – would augment wealth concentration further.	这些资本所有者有将很大部分收入储蓄起来的倾向 — — 并且在很多情形中，他们的子女数量不多 — — 因此财富集中度将进一步增加。
Other factors could help to augment inequality further.	其他因素也在推动不平等性加剧。
One that has been largely neglected in the debate about Piketty’s book is the tendency of the superrich to marry one another – an increasingly common phenomenon as more women join the group of high earners.	其中之一在关于皮克提的书的争论中鲜有提及，即巨富之间的联姻倾向 — — 随着更多女性加入高收入行列，这一现象正变得日益普遍。
This, too, causes income concentration to occur faster than it did two or three decades ago, when wealthy men married women less likely to have comparably large incomes.	这也导致收入集中的速度比二三十年前更快，当时的富有男性与收入相当的女性结婚的概率更低。
Add to that the modern scale effects on professional and “superstar” incomes – a result of winner-take-all global markets – and a picture emerges of fundamental forces tending to concentrate primary income at the top.	此外还有现代职业规模效应和“超级巨星”收入 — — 这是赢家通吃的全球市场所带来的结果 — — 所有这些组成了一股基本力量，让初级收入向最顶层集中。
Without potent policies aimed at counteracting these trends, inequality will almost certainly continue to rise in the coming years.	如果不对这些趋势采取强有力的政策，不平等性几乎肯定会在未来几年中继续加剧。
Restoring some balance to the income distribution and encouraging social mobility, while strengthening incentives for innovation and growth, will be among the most important – and formidable – challenges of the twenty-first century.	重塑收入分配和鼓励社会流动的平衡，同时增强创新和增长激励是二十一世纪最重要也最艰巨的挑战。
	
Europe’s Political Transcendence	欧洲的政治超越
WASHINGTON, DC – This month, European citizens will head to the polls to select the 751 members of the European Parliament to represent 507 million people.	华盛顿—本月，欧洲公民将选出751位代表5.07亿人民的欧洲议会议员。
The way the election campaign has unfolded marks a small but significant step in the emergence of the first transnational political space in European – indeed, world – history.	此次选举竞争的展开方式标志着欧洲 — — 事实上，是世界 — — 历史上第一个跨国政治空间出现的一小步，但这一小步意义重大。
To be sure, the European Parliament elections have been bringing smaller shares of voters to the polls: 43% in 2009, compared to almost 60% in 1978-1994.	事实上，欧洲议会选举投票率越来越低了：2009年是43 % ， 而1978—1994年间是近60 % 。
Nonetheless, the participation rate over the last decade is comparable to average turnout in American congressional elections.	尽管如此，过去十年的参与率与美国国会选举平均水平相当。
Given the perceived remoteness of the European parliament and widespread frustration with the European Union’s bureaucracy, the level of participation and the movement toward transnational politics is remarkable.	考虑到欧洲议会与选民日常生活距离比较遥远，并且欧盟的官僚主义也饱受诟病，因此这一参与率水平以及朝向跨国政治的趋势是值得瞩目的。
The transnational nature of the election is stronger this time because the major pan-European political parties have, for the first time, nominated specific candidates for the presidency of the European Commission, and the candidates are campaigning, including in televised debates.	此次选举的跨国性质更大了，因为主要泛欧洲政党第一次提名了具体的欧盟委员会主席候选人，并且这些候选人都开展了包括电视辩论在内的竞选活动。
The European Council, as mandated by the Lisbon Treaty, will have to take into account the election results in selecting the candidate to put forward for parliamentary endorsement.	根据里斯本条约的授权，欧洲理事会必须在提出候选人供议会审议支持时必须考虑选举结果。
The campaign for the Commission’s presidency may turn out to be as significant as the final selection.	欧盟委员会主席选战可能与最终决选一样重大。
The first debate, held late last month, included Jean-Claude Juncker of the center-right European People’s Party (EPP), the Green Party’s Ska Keller, Martin Schultz of the center-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, and Guy Verhofstadt of the centrist Alliance of Liberals and Democrats.	在上个月举行的第一场辩论中，中右翼的欧洲人民党（EPP）的让-克劳德·容克（Jean-Claude Juncker ） 、 绿党的斯卡·凯勒（Ska Keller ） 、 中左翼的社会和民主进步联盟（Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats）的马丁·舒尔茨（Martin Schultz）和中间派的自由和民主联盟（Alliance of Liberals and Democrats）的盖伊·沃尔霍夫斯塔特（Guy Verhofstadt）悉数登场。
Alexis Tsipras, representing the Party of the European Left, is expected to participate in the final debate this month.	代表欧洲左翼党（Party of the European Left）的阿莱克西斯·齐普拉斯（Alexis Tsipras）预计将在本月的最终辩论中露面。
All of the candidates spoke flawless English – though the debate was translated into 16 languages.	所有这些候选人都说得一口好英语 — — 尽管辩论被翻译为16国语言。
Given the United Kingdom’s reservations about European integration, it is somewhat ironic that English is playing such a critical role in facilitating the creation of a transnational political space.	由于英国对欧洲一体化持保留态度，因此英语在促进建立跨国政治空间方面起着如此关键的作用显得有些讽刺。
The debate attracted significant social-media attention, with tens of thousands of tweets on the subject reflecting the passion that some Europeans – especially the younger generation – feel about Europe’s political evolution.	辩论吸引了社交媒体的广泛关注，关于此话题的推特数量成千上万，反映出一些欧洲人 — — 特别是年轻一代 — — 很关心欧洲的政治演进。
More generally, while public interest in the campaign remains far below that seen in national political contests, it has become stronger than in recent pan-European elections, despite the rise of nationalism and Euro-skepticism.	更一般地说，尽管对此次选战的公共兴趣仍远低于国家政治竞争，但比最近几次泛欧洲选举都要高，虽然民族主义和欧元怀疑主义正在日益流行。
In this context, it would be strange if the European Council tried to nominate the Commission president without regard for the public’s response to the campaign.	在这样的情况下，欧洲委理事会在不考虑公众对选战反应的情况下提名欧盟委员会主席显得有些奇怪。
And yet there is a risk that the selection process becomes no more than an exercise in political horse-trading, with Council members awarding leadership positions, including seats on the Commission, purely on the basis of national political considerations.	但另一个风险是遴选过程沦为讨价还价过程，理事会委员授予领导位置的决定 — — 包括欧盟委员会的职位 — — 纯粹取决于国家政治考虑。
Such an approach would deal a powerful blow to the citizens who took their European ballot seriously – and to the credibility of the EU as a whole.	这样的做法将对认真对待欧洲选票的公民造成重大打击，也极大地影响欧盟作为一个整体的信誉。
Could this really happen?	真的会发生这样的情况吗？
Or has the transnational European space – however young – already grown to the point that it cannot be ignored?	还是跨国欧洲空间 — — 不管多么年轻 — — 已经成长到了不可忽视的程度？
Much will depend on the election results.	这很大程度上取决于选举结果。
First and foremost, the participation rate will be critical.	首先也是最重要的，参与率十分关键。
If it were to fall below the 43% attained in 2009, the Council could more plausibly argue that the preferences of a decreasingly interested public can be largely ignored.	如果还不如2009年43%的参与率，那么欧洲理事会可以更加理直气壮地指出，兴趣日渐的公众的偏好大可忽略。
A substantial increase, however – say, toward the 45-47% range – would make it much more difficult to ignore the outcome of the campaign.	但是，如果参与率大幅上升 — — 比如达到45—47%的水平 — — 那么要忽略选战结果就很困难了。
The relative performance of the pan-European parties will also matter.	泛欧洲政党的相对表现也很重要。
If, for example, the Socialists won 215 seats, compared to 185 for the EPP, the substantial difference would make their leader, Martin Schultz, a very strong contender, even though no party came close to an absolute majority of 376 seats.	比如，孤弱社会党赢得215席而EPP赢得185席，那么这一重大差距将使其领导人马丁·舒尔茨成为有力竞争者，即便没有一个政党接近于376席的绝对多数。
If the outcome turns out to be closer, with a difference of only five or ten seats between the two top parties, it could be argued that neither of the leading candidates had “won.”	如果结果更加接近，比如最领先的两个政党只相差了五席或十席，那么可以说没有哪位领先候选人“赢”了。
This would give the Council more space to consider an “outside” candidate (for example, Pascal Lamy, who is closer to the center left, or Christine Lagarde, who is closer to the center right, both of whom are extremely experienced European policymakers whose names have already been raised in the media).	这可以让理事会获得更大空间考虑“外部”候选人（比如更接近中左翼的帕斯卡尔·拉米（Pascal Lamy）或更接近于中右翼的克里斯汀·拉加德（Christine Lagarde ） ， 他们都是经验丰富的欧洲决策者，名字经常出现在媒体 ） 。
To bolster the legitimacy of such a move, the Council would have to select the candidate more closely associated with the party that gained more votes, however narrow the margin.	为了增加这一行动的合法性，欧洲理事会必须选择与获得多数选票的政党（不管领先优势多小）更接近的候选人。
Moreover, an outside candidate must be likely to generate backing by a sufficiently large coalition in the parliament.	此外，外部候选人必须有望获得议会内足够大的联盟的总体支持。
Alternatively, with neither of the larger parties able to declare real victory, they could decide as a compromise to indicate preference for one of the other leaders who had campaigned – perhaps Verhofstadt, the liberal centrist.	或者，如果没有哪个大党可以宣布真正的胜利，它们可以决定形成妥协，表示更愿意提名代表自由中间派的一位其他领导人 — — 也许是沃尔霍夫斯塔特。
As Jean Pisani-Ferry has explained, despite the European Parliament’s substantial – and increasing – power, it cannot be the central actor in Europe’s economic-policy debates in the short term.	正如让·皮萨尼-费里（Jean Pisani-Ferry）所解释的，尽管欧洲议会的实质权力很大并且还在增加，但它不可能在短期成为欧洲经济政策争论的核心行动方。
Real decision-making power will remain largely national.	真正的决策权力基本上仍属于国家层面。
But, given the parliament’s position at the center of a nascent transnational European space that could, over time, transform Europe’s politics and help the continent overcome resurgent and dangerous chauvinism, this first European election with a transnational flavor should not be ignored.	但是，由于议会在尚在襁褓阶段的跨国欧洲空间中占有核心地位，而随着时间的推移，这一跨国空间有可能改变欧洲的政局、帮助欧洲大陆克服危险的沙文主义死灰复燃，因此第一次带跨国印记的欧洲选举不可忽视。
When they meet on May 28, European leaders would do well to encourage the strength of European institutions by choosing both competence and legitimacy.	在5月28日会晤时，欧洲领导人应该选择胜任性和合法性，这样能够极大地强化欧洲机构。
	
A Great Breakdown?	大崩溃？
ISTANBUL – This month – the centenary of the outbreak of World War I – is an opportune time to reflect on big risks.	伊斯坦布尔—本月是一战爆发一百周年纪念，也是深刻思考大风险的良机。
As Michael Spence recently warned, the international order’s widening security deficit, reflecting the weakening of whatever global governance we have, is fast becoming the biggest risk facing the world economy.	正如迈克尔·斯宾塞（Michael Spence）最近所警告的，国际秩序的安全赤字日益扩大，这反映出我们所具备的全球治理正在日益衰落，这一问题正在快速成为世界经济所面临的最大风险。
The same point could have been made a century ago.	一个世纪以前也是如此。
On July 30, 1914, Austrian warships bombarded Belgrade, five weeks after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo.	1914年7月30日，在斐迪南大公于萨拉热窝遇刺五周后，奥地利军舰开始炮轰贝尔格莱德。
By mid-August, the world was at war.	到8月中旬，全世界都卷入了战争。
The armistice that was agreed four years later, after about 20 million people had died, amounted only to an interlude before the horror of World War II.	四年后，当停战协议最终达成时，已有2,000万人失去了生命，而在短暂的停战期后爆发了更加恐怖的第二次世界大战。
In the years preceding August 1914, until the assassination of the archduke, the global economy performed relatively well: trade expanded worldwide, financial markets seemed healthy, and the business community shrugged off political problems as either temporary or irrelevant.	在1914年8月之前的几年中，直到斐迪南大公遇刺之前，全球经济表现相对来说相当出色：贸易在全球扩张，金融市场看起来十分健康，商界对政治问题不太关心，认为即便不是暂时性的也与商业无关。
It was a political breakdown that led to three terrible decades for the world economy.	一场政治崩溃把世界经济拖入了可怕的三十年。
Markets and economic activity can withstand a great deal of political stress and uncertainty – up to the point that the international order breaks down.	市场和经济活动可以战胜大量政治压力和不确定性 — — 直到国际秩序崩溃。
Today, for example, the economic mood is rather upbeat.	比如，如今的经济情绪十分高涨。
The International Monetary Fund forecasts 4% growth for the world economy in 2015, while stock-market indices are up in many parts of the world; indeed, the Dow Jones reached an all-time high in July.	国际货币基金组织（IMF）预测2015年世界经济可以增长4 % ， 世界各地的股市也纷纷上涨，道琼斯指数更是创出历史新高。
In the last few months, however, a civilian airliner was downed in eastern Ukraine by a sophisticated Russian-made missile, tensions have increased around disputed islands in the South and East China Seas, and chaos in the Middle East has continued to spread.	但是，在过去几个月中，民航班机在东乌克兰被先进的俄罗斯制导弹击落，中国东海和南海的争议岛屿紧张局势升级，中东的乱局也在继续蔓延。
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is in one of its worst phases in decades, with the renewed frustration unleashed by the massive loss of civilian life in Gaza likely to encourage extreme reactions.	以色列-巴勒斯坦冲突进入了几十年来最糟糕的阶段，加沙平民大量伤亡的坏消息有可能鼓励极端反应。
Terrorists may be on the verge of designing much less detectable weapons.	恐怖分子也许很快就能获得极难侦测到的武器。
There are other, less “political” dangers.	还有其他不那么“政治”的危险。
West Africa is afflicted by a terrible outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus, which will kill thousands of people.	西非正在经历可怕的埃博拉致命病毒大爆发，数千人将因此丧命。
The outbreak has so far remained regional, but it serves as a reminder that in an age of air travel by millions, no one is safe from the spread of infectious disease.	埃博拉病毒的爆发目前仍是地区性的，但它提醒我们，在这个数百万人坐着飞机满世界飞的时代，在传染病大爆发面前，没有人是安全的。
Containing a disease or a terrorist threat by curtailing international travel or transport would devastate the world economy.	通过切断国际旅行或交通战胜一种疾病或恐怖威胁会摧毁世界经济。
Thinking about August 1914 should remind us that great catastrophes can materialize gradually.	反思1914年8月可以提醒我们，大灾难可能是逐渐积累起来的。
Leaders can be “sleepwalkers” who fail to manage risk by, say, establishing institutions that can channel the rival interests and claims that fuel international conflict.	领导人可能成为“梦游者 ” ， 无法通过（比如）建立能够协调导致和助长国际冲突的对立利益的机构遏制风险。
Such sleepwalking by policymakers caused the financial meltdown of 2008 as well.	这种��策者的梦游情况也正是2008年金融崩盘的原因。
Its consequences were not as deadly, though the political effects of mass unemployment and the heightened perception of economic insecurity are still with us.	金融危机的后果不那么致命，尽管大规模失业和经济不安全感的政治影响仍然挥之不去。
These examples should spur the world to find ways forward for cooperative action.	这些例子应该刺激世界寻找合作行动的办法。
But the opposite appears to be happening.	但局面指向了相反的方向。
The United Nations seems more paralyzed than ever.	联合国似乎陷入了前所未有的瘫痪状态。
The US Congress still has not approved the IMF reform package agreed in 2010, weakening one of the most important international institutions.	美国国会至今仍未批准2010年达成一致的IMF改革计划，这削弱了最重要的国际机构之一。
Partly because the United States makes capital increases and governance reforms in global financial institutions so difficult, the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) have launched their own development bank, to be based in Shanghai.	部分地因为美国让全球金融机构的增资和治理改革变得如此困难，金砖国家（巴西、俄罗斯、印度、中国和南非）另起炉灶在上海成立了它们自己的开发银行。
Likewise, instead of providing a shining example of supranational cooperation and pooled sovereignty for the twenty-first century, the European Union remains mired in rather petty disputes.	类似地，欧盟没有为二十一世纪超国家合作和主权集中树立积极的榜样，而是仍然在细枝末节的纠缠中裹足不前。
While it still cannot fully agree on the design of its banking union, it is allowing Prime Minister Viktor Orbán of Hungary, a member country, to denigrate the democratic and liberal values upon which the EU rests.	欧盟至今仍无法一致通过银行联盟设计方案，甚至还放任其成员国之一匈牙利总理欧尔班（Viktor Orbán）诋毁作为欧盟基石的民主和自由的价值。
The way forward cannot be a return to the past, with its clashing nation-states.	前进之路不能开道车，欧洲不能倒退回民族国家互相碰撞的状况。
The future can be secured only by strong cooperation among all those committed to liberal democracy and the rule of law, with no double standards or excuses, and by patient strengthening of international institutions that embody these values and can translate them into practice.	唯有所有致力于自由民主和法治精神的国家展开强有力的合作，杜绝双重标准和各种借口，耐心地强化坚持这些价值并能将它们转化为实践的国际机构，才能保障我们的未来。
Whenever a global or regional power acts in a way that contradicts these values, or allies itself closely with those who do, it undermines the international order, which should deliver security and increasing prosperity (and to some degree has).	每当全球和地区强国与这些价值背道而驰，或与这样的国家建立紧密盟友关系时，本应带来安全和日益繁荣（从某种程度上说也的确如此）的国际秩序就会遭到破坏。
The global economy holds great promise, but it is a promise that can be realized only in an international system based on rules, consent, respect, and a shared sense of justice.	全球经济许下了重大的承诺，但这一承诺只有在基于规则、同意、尊重和共同的正义感的国际制度下才能实现。
The fact that neither the mayhem in the Middle East nor the crisis in Ukraine seem to touch financial markets should not lull us into complacency.	中东的重大创伤和乌克兰危机都没有波及金融市场，决不能让这一事实导致我们的自满。
The memory of August 1914 should remind us how the world stumbled into catastrophe.	1914年8月的经验应该提醒我们，世界灾难是如何产生的。
As we know – or should know – from the example of climate change, big risks must be managed, even if the probability of worse-case outcomes is low.	从气候变化的例子中，我们知道 — — 也应该知道重大风险必须得到很好地管理，即使糟糕结果出现的概率很低。
	
Catching Up at Different Speeds	不同的赶超速度
PARIS – With weak demand in advanced countries now impeding growth in emerging economies, including major players in Asia and Latin America, many are arguing that the era of income convergence has come to an end.	巴黎—如今，发达经济体需求不振正在影响亚洲和拉美大国在内的新兴经济体的增长，据此，许多人指出收入趋同时代已经走向了结束。
Nothing could be further from the truth.	大错特错。
As I have argued before, convergence of emerging countries’ real average incomes, in the aggregate, with advanced countries’ incomes is likely to continue into the 2020’s.	正如我此前所指出的，新兴国家实际平均收入向发达国家趋近的总体趋势可能会一直持续到21世纪20年代。
That process started in the late 1980’s, and continued unabated, except in the years around the Asian financial crisis in 1997-1998.	这一过程始于20世纪80年代，其势头一直不减，只在1997—1998年亚洲金融危机期间略有衰退。
The pace of convergence accelerated further during, and just after, the global financial crisis of 2008-2009: the aggregate average differential in per capita income growth increased to more than four percentage points in the 2008-2012 period, from a little more than two percentage points in the two decades before.	趋同的速度在2008—2009年全球金融危机期间及稍后有所加快：2008—2012年，人均收入增长率的总体平均差异扩大到四个百分点以上，而二十年前为两个百分点。
As the advanced economies recover, however weakly, the growth differential is likely to narrow again, perhaps to about two percentage points, which still implies steady convergence at a decent pace.	随着发达经济体的复苏（不管其势头多么虚弱 ） ， 增长差异可能再度缩小，也许会回到两个百分点的水平，但仍是相当可观的稳定趋同速度。
In that sense, it is not “the end of the party” for emerging markets, as some claimed early last summer, when US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke’s suggestion of a possible “taper” of the Fed’s policy of quantitative easing triggered a “mini-crisis” in several of the more vulnerable emerging markets.	照此看，这决非新兴市场“派对结束 ” 。 在过去的这个夏天，美联储主席伯南克暗示可能“逐渐收缩”美联储量化宽松政策，这在几个较脆弱的新兴市场引起了“迷你危机 ” ， 从而导致一些人迫不及待地放出了“派对结束”论。
These economies have since recovered a significant part of the lost ground in terms of exchange rates and asset prices.	从汇率和资产价格角度看，这些经济体纷纷收复了迷你危机中的失地。
A major part of the economic-convergence process that has been taking place since the late 1980’s has been due to “catch-up” growth.	20世纪80年代末以来的经济趋同过程很大程度上要归因于“赶超”增长。
The emerging markets developed the institutions and the skills base needed to import and adapt technology, which is easier than generating new technology from scratch.	新兴市场发展了进口和适应技术所需要的制度和技能基础，这比自主开发新技术容易得多。
The pace of catch-up growth declines only gradually over time, as the less advanced economies slowly move closer to the technological frontier.	随着技术较不发达经济体慢慢地接近技术前沿，赶超增长速度也随时间的推移而渐渐下降。
The catch-up process also takes place within countries, as labor moves from low-productivity rural activities to higher-productivity urban activities, and as low-productivity firms in all sectors emulate their more advanced domestic counterparts.	赶超过程也存在于国家内部 — — 劳动力从低生产率的农村活动转向高生产率的城市活动，各部门的低生产率企业纷纷模仿更先进的国内同行。
Moreover, the transfer and diffusion of technology has been facilitated greatly over the last few decades by increased foreign direct investment, the information revolution, which has facilitated access to knowledge, increased trade, and the globalization of financial markets.	此外，在过去几十年中，技术的转移和扩散也增加了外国直接投资，带来了促进知识普及的技术革命，增加了贸易，推进了金融市场全球化，从而起到了极大的助力作用。
These factors apply to emerging countries generally.	这些因素对于所有新兴国家都适用。
Why, then, do Latin American economists seem to share a cautious – even pessimistic – mood about future growth and convergence in the region, whereas most Asian economists, while conceding that further structural reforms are needed, believe strongly that Asia will continue to converge rather rapidly?	那么，为什么拉美经济学家对未来增长和地区趋同无不表示谨慎（甚至悲观 ） ， 而大部分亚洲经济学家尽管也承认需要进一步的结构性改革，但都坚信亚洲将继续以较快的速度趋同？
Beyond global factors that apply to all, rapid catch-up growth requires sufficient investment in both physical and human capital.	除了适用于所有国家的全球因素，快速赶超增长还需要对实物和人力资本进行充分的投资。
New manufacturing techniques and new products or product improvements are usually embodied in new machines and skills.	新制造技术和新产品或产品改良往往包含在新机器和新技能中。
China has invested about 43% of its GDP, on average, during the 2000-2013 period.	2000—2013年，平均而言中国GDP中有43%被用于投资。
Emerging Asia, excluding China but including India, has invested about 28% of GDP over the same period, while the investment share for Latin America has been just 21%.	新兴亚洲（不含中国但包括印度）的同期水平是28 % ， 而拉美的投资比例只有21 % 。
That alone probably explains much of the difference among China, in a category of its own, emerging Asia, and Latin America.	光是这一点就可以解释独树一帜的中国、新兴亚洲和拉美之间的大部分差异。
The quality of skills and education cannot be measured as easily by a single figure, but there is ample evidence that Latin America has also lagged behind most of Asia when it comes to skills accumulation.	技能和教育的质量无法用一个简单的数字来轻易地衡量，但有充分的证据表明拉美���技能积累方面也落后于大部分亚洲国家。
Many other factors, of course, influence growth and convergence: macroeconomic stability, the efficiency and robustness of the financial sector, the terms of trade, the quality of public administration, demographic factors, and political factors.	当然，还有许多其他因素也影响着增长和趋同：宏观经济稳定性、金融部门效率和稳健性、贸易条件、公共管理质量、人口因素和政治因素等。
There also is variation within regions, including among provinces of China.	此外还有地区内差异，如中国各省之间的差异。
(Likewise, Africa’s growth performance has improved spectacularly since the turn of the century, but variance within the continent is even larger than elsewhere.)	（类似地，自世纪之交以来，非洲的增长表现颇为亮眼，但非洲大陆内部的差异比其他地区都要大。
Nonetheless, in terms of the likely strength of the convergence process that globalization has facilitated, it is important to distinguish between Latin America and Asia, and, within Asia, to distinguish China from the rest of the continent.	）尽管如此，从得力于全球化的趋同过程的可能优势的角度看，区分拉美和亚洲以及在亚洲内部区分中国和其他国家是十分重要的。
China’s economy will most likely continue to converge rapidly, though its annual growth rate may fall from 9% to 7%.	中国经济最可能继续快速趋同过程，尽管其年增长率可能从9%下降至7 % 。
The rest of emerging Asia will also converge reasonably quickly, though not as quickly as China.	其他亚洲新兴国家也将以较快速度趋同，但不如中国。
Latin America, however, will likely converge only very slowly in the absence of major structural reforms that increase its ability to invest and improve the quality of education.	但是，拉美若无法通过重大结构性改革增强器投资能力、改善其教育质量，其趋同速度可能将相当缓慢。
There will surely be exceptions to this general trend, but there are some stable regional characteristics.	当然，这一总体趋势难免会出现些许例外，但有些地区特征十分稳定。
Overall, however, basic economics, which has always stressed the need to save and invest in order to grow, still explains a lot.	但是，总体而言，经济学基础 — — 一贯强调储蓄和投资对提振增长的重要性 — — 仍具有强大的解释力。
Latin America and Asia operate in the same global economy, with access to similar technology and markets.	拉美和亚洲存在于一个共同的全球经济中，面临相似的技术和市场。
If Latin America invests around 20% of its national income in a sustained manner, while emerging Asia invests close to 30% – including investments in education – emerging Asia will converge significantly more rapidly.	如果拉美一直将20%左右的国民收入用于投资，而亚洲这一比例接近30 % — —包括对教育的投资 — — 那么新兴亚洲的趋同速度将显著快于拉美。
	
Democracy in Europe	欧洲的民主
ROME – A real struggle over who will preside over the European Commission has begun.	罗马—争夺谁领衔欧盟委员会的现实斗争开始了。
Though the center-right European People’s Party won only a narrow plurality of 221 seats in the 751-seat European Parliament, center-left, green, and liberal MEPs have all rallied behind the EPP’s candidate, Jean-Claude Juncker, as the “legitimate” choice.	尽管中右翼的欧洲人民党（European People’s Party）只获得了欧洲议会751个议席中的221个，但中左翼政党、绿党和MEP都在背后支持欧洲人民党候选人让-克劳德·容克（Jean-Claude Juncker）为“合法”选择。
The opposition, led by British Prime Minister David Cameron with the support of “sovereignists” across Europe, particularly in Scandinavia, but also in Hungary, contends that someone whom the majority of European citizens hardly know, cannot claim any kind of political legitimacy.	反对派则由英国首相大卫·卡梅伦领衔，背后有全欧洲（特别是斯堪的纳维亚国家，也包括匈牙利 ） “ 主权主义者”的支持，主张大部分欧洲公民都没有听说过的名字无法获得任何政治合法性。
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is now in a bind.	德国总理默克尔现在陷入了两难。
Though she endorsed Juncker before the election, she never really backed the notion that the European Parliament should have a decisive part in selecting the Commission’s president.	尽管在选举前她支持容克，但她从未支持欧洲议会应该在选择欧盟委员会主席方面起到决定性作用这一观点。
She was certain that no party would win an absolute majority, but she did not foresee that almost all representatives from moderate parties would back whichever candidate won a plurality, making it difficult to appoint anyone else.	她笃定地认为没有一个政党能够获得绝对多数，但她没有预料到几乎所有来自温和政党的代表不论谁获得多数都会支持他，这使得任命其他人变得十分困难。
The larger issue at stake is whether Europe is prepared to establish the common political space that is needed to manage the monetary union and strengthen the European Union’s influence in world affairs.	更大的问题是欧洲是否准备好了建立一个管理货币联盟、强化欧盟在世界事务上的影响力所必须的共同政治空间。
Most economists agree that in the absence of advanced fiscal-policy coordination and a real banking union, Europe’s monetary union cannot succeed.	大部分经济学家都同意，没有高级财政政策协作和真正的银行联盟，欧洲的货币联盟就不可能成功。
This does not bother the United Kingdom, which has no desire to join the eurozone.	英国对此并不担心，因为它本无意加入欧元区。
Among eurozone members, however, the need for greater political integration is broadly accepted, and not just by the economic and political elites.	但是，在欧元区国家中间，加强政治一体化的必要性已被广泛接受，并且不仅仅局限于经济和政治精英中间。
Moreover, as Russia’s recent assertions of power in Ukraine and elsewhere in the former Soviet Union demonstrate, European countries need to deepen their security cooperation and develop a common energy policy.	此外，俄罗斯最近在乌克兰和其他前苏联地区耀武扬威，这表明欧洲国家需要深化安全合作、发展共同能源政策。
And, though cooperation in areas such as of data privacy, financial-sector regulation, and climate change may not require the degree of political integration that a common currency does, it would benefit greatly from stronger political cohesion and a more profound sense of shared European identity.	而尽管在数据隐私、金融部门监管和气候变化等领域的合作并不需要如共同货币那么深的政治一体化程度，但加强政治团结、深化欧洲身份的认同感能够带来巨大的裨益。
The pan-European parties’ nomination of Spitzenkandidaten for the Commission presidency – and the three direct debates among the nominees – marked the start of building a genuine supranational European political space.	泛欧洲政党所提名的欧盟委员会主席首席候选人 — — 以及被提名者之间的三次直接争论 — — 标志着开始建立真正的超国家欧洲政治空间。
Indeed, the endorsement of Juncker by the Social Democrats, the Greens, and the Liberals reflects their belief in the need for such a space.	事实上，社会民主党、绿党和自由派支持容克反映出他们认为需要有这样一个空间。
The candidates, particularly Martin Schulz, the leader of the Party of European Socialists, campaigned beyond their national borders.	候选人 — — 特别是欧洲社会党（Party of European Socialists）领袖马丁·舒尔茨（Martin Schultz ） — —的竞选活动也超越了国界。
But Europe still has a long way to go, which is apparent from the fact that only a minority of European citizens followed the campaign.	但欧洲仍有很长的路要走，这一点从只有少数欧洲公民跟进了竞选活动这一事实便可一览无余。
A supra-national political space can develop only if European politics gains visibility, influence, and credibility.	超国家政治空间只有在欧洲政治获得透明度、影响力和信誉的情况下才有可能获得发展。
For this reason, Europe’s leaders should reach a compromise on the next Commission president quickly and transparently, thereby dispelling the impression among ordinary citizens that European politics is shaped by a dysfunctional process of behind-the-scenes horse-trading.	因此，欧洲领导人应该就下任欧盟委员会主席的人选问题迅速形成妥协，从而打消普通公民关于欧洲政治仍被幕后扯皮左右的印象。
As usual, Merkel has a critical role to play.	与往常一样，默克尔在其中作用十分关键。
Her endorsement of a candidate whom she knew Cameron would vehemently oppose was a serious mistake, because it strengthened the hand of those in the UK who want to leave the EU.	她支持明知卡梅伦强烈反对的候选人是一个严重错误，因为这让想脱离欧盟的英国人底气更足了。
Merkel must now determine how to forge a compromise that does not discredit the Europe-wide democratic process, which currently has more support in Germany than in any other large European country.	现在，默克尔必须决定如何制造一个妥协不令泛欧洲民主进程失去信誉。 目前，欧洲民主进程在德国所获得的支持多于任何一个其他欧洲大国。
To this end, support from Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi – whose party won 41% of his country’s vote, arguably making him the only real winner at the national level – could help.	在这方面，来自意大利总理伦齐的支持 — — 他的政党在意大利获得了41%的选票，这意味着他很有可能是硕果仅存的货真价实的国家层面赢家 — — 是大有裨益的。
The stakes are high – and not just for Europe.	这是一场豪赌 — — 不仅对欧洲是如此。
The world needs a thriving, cohesive EU to advance democratic principles, facilitate conflict resolution, protect the global commons, promote peace, and build trust across borders.	世界需要繁荣、团结的欧洲推进民主原则、促进冲突解决、保护全球平民、推广和平、建立国家间信任。
The alternative – already gaining traction – is the resurgence of naked power politics and dangerous xenophobia.	否则 — — 可能性越来越大 — — 迎接我们的将是赤裸裸的权力政治和危险的排外主义的复兴。
Without a shared European political space, everyone will be much worse off.	没有共同的欧洲政治空间，所有人都会大大受损。
	
Revamping Europe’s Tattered Social Contract	改造欧洲破坏的社会契约
WASHINGTON, DC – For most of the beginning of 2014, the eurozone seemed to be in a state of recovery – weak and unsteady, but nonetheless real.	华盛顿—在2014年初的大部分时间里，欧元区似乎进入了复苏状态 — — 疲软又踉跄，但确实是复苏。
In April, the International Monetary Fund estimated that overall GDP growth would reach 1.2% this year, with slowly declining unemployment, up from its previous forecast of 1% growth.	4月，国际货币基金组织（IMF）估计今年总体GDP增长将达1.2 % ， 失业率将缓慢下降，较此前的预测（增长1 % ） 有所提高。
With the threat of unsustainably high interest rates in the countries of the eurozone periphery having disappeared, the path to moderate recovery was supposedly open, to be followed by some acceleration in growth in 2015.	欧元区外围高得不可持续的利率开始下降，人们因此认为温和复苏的大门已经打开，增长将在2015年出现加速。
While it is important not to overreact to quarterly figures, recent data, as well as some of the revised data for the first quarter, are deeply disappointing.	尽管对季度数据不必过度反应，但最新数据以及一些一季度的修正数据令人大失所望。
The pessimism of two years ago has returned – with good reason.	两年前的悲观情绪开始回潮 — — 理由相当充分。
Italy is in an outright recession, and, far from showing hoped-for signs of vitality. French growth is close to zero.	意大利已经陷入了彻底的衰退，并且远远没有表现出人们所盼望的活力信号。
Even Germany’s GDP declined in quarterly terms in the first half of the year.	法国增长率接近于零，甚至德国GDP季度表现也在今年上半年有所退步。
Finland, a staunch supporter of firm austerity policies, is in negative territory for the first half of the year.	紧缩政策的坚决支持者芬兰今年上半年更是出现了负增长。
Nominal interest rates for periphery countries’ sovereign debt have remained extremely low, and, even when taking into account expectations of very low inflation (or even deflation), real interest rates are low.	外围国主权债务名义利率仍然非常低，而即使将极低的通胀预期（甚至通缩预期）考虑在内，实际利率仍然很低。
The eurozone now is facing not only a financial crisis, but a stagnation crisis.	如今，欧元区不仅面临金融危机，也面临停滞危机。
Tensions with Russia may make recovery even more difficult, and it is unlikely that the eurozone can attain 1% growth in 2014 without major policy changes.	与俄罗斯的紧张局面让复苏变得更加困难，没有重大政策变化，2014年欧元区增长不可能大到1 % 。
The European Central Bank has announced that it will offer new monetary-policy support and has decided to use all instruments short of direct quantitative easing (it is still not buying sovereign bonds).	欧洲央行宣布将提供新的货币政策支持，并决定使用除量化宽松之外的一切工具（它仍然没有购买主权债券 ） 。
But it is far from clear whether the proverbial horse led to water will actually drink.	但是否能有效果还远未可知。
If growth and employment expectations remain dismal, it will be difficult to rekindle demand, particularly private business investment, no matter how low interest rates are, or how many resources banks have for potential lending.	如果增长和就业预期继续萎靡，就很难重振需求，特别是私人商业投资，不管利率多么低，也不管银行拥有多么大的潜在贷款资源。
ECB President Mario Draghi’s message in his speech last month in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, as well as at his September press conference was a clear call for more fiscal support to boost effective demand.	欧洲央行行长德拉吉在上个月的怀俄明州杰克森霍尔（Jackson Hole）的讲话以及9月记者招待会上的发言都在明确呼吁采取更多的财政支持以提振有效需求。
The essential economic problem is clear: there is an almost desperate need for more fiscal space in the eurozone to boost aggregate demand, including more investment in Germany.	根本的经济学问题很清楚：欧元区极度渴望增加财政空间以提振总需求，包括增加德国的投资。
But there is also a persistent need for deep structural reforms on the supply side, so that fiscal stimulus translates into sustainable long-term growth, not just temporary spurts and further increases in countries’ debt ratios.	但在需求端，还存在持久的深刻结构性改革需要，以使财政刺激转化为可持续长期增长而不仅仅是暂时性的爆发和国家债务比率的进一步上升。
What the “best” structural reforms actually are remains a matter for debate.	什么是“最佳”结构性改革还有待争论。
But in most countries, they include some combination of tax, labor-market, service-sector, and education reforms, as well as reforms in territorial administration, particularly in France.	但���大部分国家，税收、劳动力市场、服务业和教育改革多管齐下，同时进行国土改革是必不可少的，特别是在法国。
These reforms should seek to achieve a thoroughly revamped social contract that reflects the realities of twenty-first-century demographics and global markets, but that also remains sensitive to Europeans’ commitment to distributive fairness and political equality, and insures citizens against shocks.	这些改革的目标应该是彻底改造社会契约，使其反映二十一世纪人口和全球市场的现实，同时也要顾及欧洲分配公平和政治平等的承诺，并保护公民免受影响。
It is easy to call for “reforms” without specifying their content or taking into account the social, historical, and political context.	呼吁“改革”而不具体指明内容或考虑社会、历史和政治因素是很容易的。
At the same time, it will not be possible to design this new social contract country by country.	与此同时，各国逐一设计这一新社会契约是不可能的。
Europe has become too interwoven in myriad ways – not just in purely financial and economic terms, but also psychologically.	欧洲以各种方式水乳交融 — — 不仅仅在纯粹的金融和经济上，在心理上也是如此。
It must have come as a surprise to many that it was a German court, not a French one, that banned Uber, the mobile app that is revolutionizing the taxi business.	对许多人来说，德国而不是法国法庭禁止给出租车行业带来革命的移动应用Uber令人震惊。
If the new social contract cannot be forged Europe-wide, it must at least apply to the eurozone to enable the necessary structural reforms.	如果不能在全欧洲水平上建立新的社会契约，也必须在欧元区使用以使必须的结构性改革得以进行。
Otherwise, given that the politics and economics of eurozone reform are inseparably linked, fiscal expansion could prove to be as ineffective as efforts by monetary policymakers to foster growth.	否则，由于欧元区改革的政治和经济之间存在不可分割的联系，财政扩张将与货币决策者的努力一样对提振增长毫无效果。
Italy’s finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, is rightly pushing for a eurozone “reform scorecard,” which would enable direct comparison among national reforms.	意大利财政部长帕多安（Pier Carlo Padoan）正确地指出应该采取欧元区“记分牌 ” ， 直接比较各国的改革。
But, beyond such a scorecard, the will to overcome the stagnation trap must be more than a sum of national wills.	但是，除了记分牌之外，克服停滞陷阱的意愿应该比各国意愿的总和更强。
Germany must be reassured by what is happening in France and Italy; conversely, Southern Europeans must be able to trust that their efforts will gain additional traction from greater investment throughout the region, particularly in Germany.	德国看到法国和意大利的情形想必不会再担心；反之，南欧人必须要能相信他们的努力能从整个地区（特别是德国）的投资增加中获得新动力。
A new social contract will not appear out of thin air.	新社会契约不会凭空产生。
Now is the time for the new European Commission to propose – and the new European Council and European Parliament to endorse – a political pact to legitimize and sustain the reforms needed to solve Europe’s economic problems.	新欧洲委员会应该提出一个新的政治契约以使解决欧洲经济问题所需要的改革合法化并得以维持，同时新的欧洲理事会和欧洲议会应该批准这一契约。
	
The Future of Economic Progress	经济进步的未来
WASHINGTON, DC – Slowly but surely, the debate about the nature of economic growth is entering a new phase.	华盛顿—关于经济增长的性质的争论进入了新阶段，这一变化虽然缓慢，但无可置疑。
The emerging questions are sufficiently different from those of recent decades that one can sense a shift in the conceptual framework that will structure the discussion of economic progress – and economic policy – from now on.	信服显得问题与近几十年来的争论问题大相径庭，我们可以从中感受到决定未来经济进步（以及经济政策）讨论的概念框架的变化。
The first question, concerning the potential pace of future economic growth, has given rise to serious disagreement among economists.	第一个问题是关于未来经济增长潜在速度的，这一问题造成了经济学家之间的严重分歧。
Robert Gordon of Northwestern University, for example, believes that the US economy will be lucky to achieve 0.5% annual per capita growth in the medium term.	比如，西北大学的罗伯特·戈登（Robert Gordon）认为，从中期看，美国经济年人均增长达到0.5%就要谢天谢地了。
Others, perhaps most carefully Dani Rodrik, have developed a version of growth pessimism for the emerging economies.	另一些人 — — 其中最认真的大概是丹尼·罗德里克（Dani Rodrik ） ， 对新兴经济体深感悲观。
The key premise, common to many of these leading analysts, is that technological progress will slow, including the catch-up gains that are most relevant for emerging and developing countries.	许多大牌分析家的共同假设是技术进步将会减速，包括与新兴和发展中国家关系最密切的赶超收益。
On the opposite side are the “new technologists.” They argue that we are at the beginning of a fourth industrial revolution, characterized by truly “intelligent machines” that will become almost perfect substitutes for low- and medium-skill labor.	另一边是“新科技派 ” ， 他们认为我们正站在第四次工业革命的门口，这次工业革命的特征是真正的“智能机器 ” ， 它们将成为中低技能劳动力的近乎完美的替代品。
These “robots” (some in the form of software), as well as the “Internet of things,” will usher in huge new productivity increases in areas such as energy efficiency, transport (for example, self-driving vehicles), medical care, and customization of mass production, thanks to 3D printing.	这些“机器人 ” （ 其中一些以软件的面目出现）也可称为“物联网 ” （ Internet of things ） ， 拜3D打印所赐，它们将在能源效率、交通（如自动驾驶汽车 ） 、 医疗和个性化大生产等领域极大地提高生产率。
Second, there is the question of income distribution.	第二个问题是收入分配。
In his instantly famous book, Thomas Piketty argues that fundamental economic forces are fueling a persistent rise in profits as a share of total income, with the rate of return on capital constantly higher than the rate of economic growth.	在最近出版的畅销书中，托马斯·皮克提（Thomas Piketty）指出，基本经济力正在让利润占总收入的比例持久性地提高，资本回报率将持续高于经济增长率。
Moreover, many have observed that if capital is becoming a close substitute for all but very highly skilled labor, while education systems need long adjustment times to supply the new skills in large quantities, much greater wage differentials between highly skilled and all other labor will cause inequality to worsen.	此外，许多人观察到，如果资本能够日益替代出高技能劳动力之外的一切，而教育体系需要经过长期调整才能大规模提供新技能，那么高技能和其他所有工种工资之间的巨大差异将导致不平等性恶化。
Perhaps the US economy in ten years will be one in which the top 5% – large capital owners, very highly skilled wage earners, and global winner-take-all performers – get 50% of national income (the percentage is not far below 40% today).	或许十年后美国经济将是这样的：顶层5 % — —大资本所有者、高技能工资工人、赢家通吃的全球领先者 — — 拿走50%的国民收入（今天的比例已接近40 % ） 。
Though national circumstances still differ greatly, the fundamental economic trends are global.	尽管国家间环境仍然大不相同，但基本经济趋势是全球性的。
Are they politically sustainable?	这些趋势在政治上可持续吗？
The third question concerns the employment effects of further automation.	第三个问题是进一步自动化的就业效应。
As was true in previous industrial revolutions, human beings may be freed from much “tedious” work.	在前几次工业革命期间，人类从非常“繁琐”的工作中得到了解放。
There will be no need for cashiers, call operators, and toll collectors, for example, and less need for accountants, travel or financial advisers, drivers, and many others.	比如，收银员、电话操作员、计票员都会消失，会计师、旅行或财务顾问、司机和其他工种的需求也会大大减少。
If the “technologists” are half-right, GDP will be much higher.	如果“科技派”部分正确，那么GDP将有很大提高。
So why should we not rejoice at the prospect of a 25- or 30-hour workweek and two months of annual leave, with intelligent machines taking up the slack?	既然如此，为何我们不能为获得25—30小时的每周工作时长和两个月的年假、让智能机器替我们劳动而欢呼雀跃呢？
Why, with all this new technology and imminent productivity increases, do so many continue to argue that everyone has to work more and retire much later in life if economies are to remain competitive?	既然有这些新科技，生产率也即将大幅度提高，为何还有这么多人继续认为所有人都必须更多地工作、更晚地退出才能让经济保持竞争力？
Or is it just the highly skilled who have to work harder and longer, because there are not enough of them?	还是说，只有高技能者才需要更努力、更长时间地工作，因为他们数量太少？
In that case, perhaps older workers should retire sooner to make room for the young, who have skills more appropriate to the new century.	果真如此的话，也许老工人应该更早退休给技能更适合新世纪的年轻人腾出空间。
If such a shift were to increase overall GDP, fiscal transfers could pay for early retirement, while retirement itself could become a flexible and gradual process.	如果这样的改变有利于增加总体GDP，财政转移就可以负担提早退休，而退休本身也可以变成有弹性的、逐渐实现的过程。
Finally, there is the question of climate change and possible natural-resource constraints, issues that have become more familiar over the last decade.	最后一个问题是气候变化以及可能的自然资源约束，这一问题在过去十年中已经耳熟能详。
Will these factors impede long-term growth, or can a transition to a clean-energy economy fuel another technological revolution that actually increases prosperity?	这些因素会妨碍长期增长吗？ 还是向清洁能源经济的转型能催生新的技术革命，实际增加繁荣？
As these questions move to the top of the policy agenda, it is becoming clearer that the traditional focus on growth, defined as an increase in aggregate GDP and calculated using national accounts invented a century ago, is less and less useful.	随着这些问题成为政策日程的最当务之急，我们可以更加清晰地看到，传统上对增长（定义为总GDP的增加，用一个世纪前发明的国民收入账户来计算衡量）的关注的用处已经越来越小。
The nature and measurement of economic progress should involve a new social contract that allows societies to manage the power of technology so that it serves all citizens.	经济进步的性质和衡量标准应该包括能够让社会驯服科技的力量使其为全体人民服务的新的社会契约。
Working, learning, enjoying leisure, and being healthy and “productive” should be part of a continuum in our lives, and policies should be explicitly aimed at what facilitates this continuum and increases measured wellbeing.	工作、学习、休闲、保持健康和“生产性”应该成为我们生活的连续统的一部分，政策目标应该明确指向促进这一连续统、增加可测福祉。
The trends underpinning widening inequality will have to be counteracted using many policy instruments, with tax regimes and life-long, inclusive, and affordable education and health care at the center of the effort to ensure equity and social mobility.	不平等性扩大背后的趋势必须用多种政策工具来解决，将税收手段和终身、包容、可负担的教育和医疗放在确保平等和社会流动的政策的核心。
Though the quality of human lives can still be greatly improved, even in the advanced countries, focusing on aggregate GDP will be less helpful in achieving this goal.	尽管人类生命质量仍可以大大改善（即使在发达国家也是如此 ） ， 但将注意力集中在总体GDP上无助于实现这一目标。
The questions surrounding future economic growth are becoming clearer.	围绕未来经济增长的问题正变得日渐清晰。
But we are only at the start of the process of creating the new conceptual framework needed to enable national and global policies to advance the cause of human progress.	但我们才站在建立新的概念框架从而促进国家和全球政策有利于推动人类进步的起点。
	
The Great War and Global Governance	大战和全球治理
ISTANBUL – This year marks the hundredth anniversary of the outbreak of World War I – and, arguably, the worst year in human history.	伊斯坦布尔—今年是第一次世界大战爆发一百周年。 一百年前的今天可能是人类历史上最糟糕的一天。
A century later, is the world any safer?	一个世纪之后的今天，世界有没有变得更安全？
Not only did WWI leave almost 40 million people dead; it can be viewed as a precursor to World War II.	一战不但带走了近4000万人的生命，也酝酿了第二次世界大战。
After all, had Germany’s hyperinflation of the 1920’s – a direct result of the war – been avoided, Hitler may well never have risen to power, and WWII might not have occurred.	毕竟，如果德国可以避免20世纪20年代的恶性通货膨胀（一战的直接后果之一 ） ， 那么希特勒就不会上台，二战也可能不会发生。
Instead, the assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, set in motion a chain of bloodletting that killed nearly 100 million people by 1945 and caused human suffering on a previously unimaginable scale.	相反，1914年6月28日刺杀奥地利斐迪南大公的行为造成了到1945年才最终结束、让近1亿人失去生命的冤冤相报，人类遭遇了此前无法想象的灾难。
Of course, generations of historians have meticulously researched the origins of the world wars and written elegantly about their conclusions.	当然，历代历史学家呕心沥血地寻找着世界大战的起源，并漂亮地写出各自的结论。
That history should spur today’s economists and policymakers to reflect on the difficult trade-off between efficiency and robustness when it comes to global governance.	历史应该刺激今天的经济学家和决策者深思全球治理问题上效率和鲁棒之间的艰难权衡。
The painstaking effort since the end of WWII to build effective regional and global governance institutions has reduced considerably the risk of catastrophes like the world wars or the Great Depression.	二战结束以来的艰苦努力造就了有效的地区和全球治理机构，极大地减小了世界大战和大萧条这样的灾难的风险。
Indeed, while such institutions are far from perfect, the progress that has been made in terms of preventing human suffering is worth far more than the efficiency costs of ensuring that they are adequately robust.	事实上，尽管这些机构远远称不上完美，但它们在防止人道灾难方面所取得的进步的价值远远超过了确保他们足够鲁棒的效率成本。
This efficiency-robustness tradeoff exists in many fields.	效率-鲁棒权衡存在于诸多领域。
When designing an airplane, aeronautical engineers must ensure sufficient robustness so that their creation can avoid crashing even under highly unusual or unforeseen circumstances.	在设计飞机时，航空工程师必须保证足够的鲁棒性，以保证他们的产品即使在极不寻常和从未遇见过的环境中也不会坠毁。
This requires a degree of redundancy – for example, extra engines and extensive backup systems – that comes at the cost of efficiency.	这要求一定程度的冗余性 — — 比如，额外的发动机和充足的备用系统 — — 这就造成了效率成本。
Economic systems also must be robust, as episodes like the Great Depression or the 2008 global financial crisis demonstrate.	经济系统也必须是鲁棒的，大萧条和2008年全球金融危机等事件就是明证。
In the United States, in particular, the financial sector’s structure prior to the recent crisis emphasized the efficient generation of huge profits – and succeeded for more than a decade.	特别是在美国，最近的危机前的金融部门结构强调高效地产生巨额利润，并在十多年的时间里取得了成功。
But the realization in 2007 that some of the system’s fundamental assumptions were no longer valid triggered a crisis with huge economic and social costs.	但2007年的现实 — — 该系统的一���根本假设不再成立触发了导致巨大经济和社会成本的危机。
Had governments worldwide not intervened with massive rescue and stimulus packages, the consequences would have been catastrophic.	如果全球政府不以大规模援助和刺激计划出手干预，后果将是灾难性的。
That near miss highlighted the unsustainability of pre-crisis policies.	如此万幸彰显出危机前政策的不可持续性。
The new Basel III banking guidelines, together with new national regulations, aim at creating a more robust financial system by insisting on higher capital-adequacy ratios, less leverage, greater separation between investment and retail banking, a better macro-prudential framework, and measures to prevent financial institutions from becoming “too big to fail.”	新的巴塞尔III银行指引和新的国家层面监管措施旨在通过更高的资本充足度、更低的杠杆水平，投资和零售银行业务更大的分离、更好的宏观审慎框架和预防金融机构变得“太大而不能倒”的措施增加金融系统的鲁棒性。
All of these efforts are shaped by the efficiency-robustness tradeoff.	所有这些措施都是效率-鲁棒权衡的结果。
If capital requirements are pushed too high, banks become less profitable, making it more difficult for them to channel savings to investment and undermining economic growth.	如果资本要求设置得太高，银行就无法盈利，从而难以将储蓄引至投资上去，破坏经济增长。
The challenge, therefore, is to find the ideal balance between opportunity and security – that is, between efficiency and robustness.	因此，挑战在于找出机会和安全之间 — — 即效率和鲁棒之间的理想平衡。
Policymakers face a similar challenge when designing, for example, efforts to combat climate change.	决策者在制定（比如）气候变化政策时也面临类似的挑战。
The scientific consensus is that greenhouse-gas emissions are generating significant risks, but the scale and timing of these risks remain uncertain.	科学界的共识是温室气体排放正在造成极大的风险，但这一风险的规模和时机还不确定。
To illustrate the tradeoff (in admittedly simplistic terms), a 14% capital-adequacy ratio for banks may be compared to the objective of stabilizing carbon-dioxide levels in the atmosphere at 450 parts per million, with both targets reflecting caution and a desire for robustness, at an immediate economic cost.	简单地说明一下权衡问题。 14%的银行资本充足度就好比是将大气二氧化碳浓度稳定在450ppm，这两个目标都体现了谨慎性和对鲁棒性的追求，但会造成即刻的经济成本。
By contrast, a capital-adequacy target of 7% and a CO2 target of 550 ppm would demonstrate policymakers’ willingness to place a higher priority on short-term gains – even if that means allowing another financial crisis or global warming’s long-term economic and human consequences to manifest themselves.	相反，7%的资本充足度和550ppm的二氧化碳浓度目标反映了决策者愿意更多地考虑短期收益 — — 即使这意味着可能放任又一场金融危机或全球变暖的长期经济和人道后果自由发展。
An extreme course in either direction would be a bad idea.	在两个方面走极端都是坏主意。
After all, it is impossible to avoid all risk, and, at a certain point, the level of inefficiency generated by excessive robustness would create new risks of collapse.	毕竟，我们不可能避免所有风险，到达一定阈值后，过度鲁棒带来的无效率将产生新的崩溃风险。
Minimizing the risk of a major war, depression, or financial breakdown thus requires that policymakers find the optimal balance – and that requires more explicit discussion of the efficiency-robustness trade-off.	因此，实现大战、萧条和金融崩溃风险的最小化需要决策者找出最优平衡 — — 而这要求更直率的效率-鲁棒权衡争论。
As it stands, policies are often presented without any mention of costs in terms of efficiency or robustness – and mere awareness of the tradeoff is insufficient for effective decision-making.	政策呈现时往往不会提及效率和鲁棒方面的成本 — — 而仅仅意识到需要权衡不足以带来有效决策。
Instead, the tradeoff must be quantified in approximate and reasonably accessible terms to facilitate productive debate and preempt polarized ideological clashes that have little hope of resolution.	相反，效率-鲁棒权衡必须得到粗略的量化，形成可合理接受的条件，以促进有意义的争论，预先防止极难解决的极端化的意识形态之争。
Perhaps the commemoration this year of the disaster unleashed in 1914 will inspire people to think more deeply about how to avoid major risks without having to pay a prohibitively high price in lost efficiency and dynamism to ensure robustness and resilience.	或许，今年对1914年灾难的共同记忆能激发人们更深地思考如何在不必付出不可承受的高代价的情况下避免重大风险 — — 即在牺牲效率和活力确保鲁棒性和恢复力之间权衡。
Now, as then, the fate of the world hangs in the balance.	和往常一样，世界的命运悬于平衡一线。
	
Good Governance and Economic Performance	良好治理与经济成效
BERLIN – The debate about emerging countries’ growth prospects is now in full swing.	发自柏林 — — 对于新兴市场国家增长前景的讨论如今已经呈现两极化。
Pessimists stress the feared reversal of private capital flows, owing to the US Federal Reserve’s tapering of its purchases of long-term assets, as well as the difficulties of so-called second- and third-generation structural reforms and the limits to “catch up” growth outside of manufacturing.	悲观主义者们对美联储收缩长期资产购买规模所导致的私人资金恐慌性回流忧心不已，再担心所谓第二代和第三代结构改革的艰巨性以及在制造业以外实现“赶超性”增长的局限性。
Optimists argue that the potential for rapid growth remains immense, owing to better macroeconomic fundamentals and the promise of best-practice technology spreading throughout the emerging world.	乐观主义者则认为还存在极大的快速增长空间，因为宏观经济基本面已经大有改善，而且最先进技术也被广泛引入各国，带来更可靠的前景。
So who is right?	那谁才是对的？
Recent events point once again to the importance of good governance and responsive political systems, a familiar topic in studies of long-term economic growth.	最近的事件再一次显示出了良好治理和灵活反应政治体制的重要性，这也是研究长期经济增长中的一个常见议题。
Countries that appeared successful for a long time, such as Turkey or Thailand, suddenly seem to face obstacles related to governance and the ability to forge domestic political compromises.	像土耳其或者泰国这类国家看似长期繁荣，但突然就遭遇了与治理以及实现国内政治妥协有关的桎梏。
The resulting divisiveness and dysfunction are surely bigger threats than the Fed’s tapering.	因此而导致的派系分裂以及国家失能很显然也要比美联储的收缩威胁更大。
It is the nature of governance that determines whether people deploy their talents and energy in pursuit of innovation, production, and job creation, or in rent seeking and lobbying for political protection.	治理的本质就是决定人们是把自己的聪明才智用在创新，生产及制造就业领域，还是花在权力寻租和寻求政治庇护之上。
And here the contrast between Egypt and Tunisia may turn out to be an object lesson in what makes the difference between success and failure.	而埃及和突尼斯之间的差别就成为了定义成功和失败国家之间区别的真实课程。
In Egypt, the old regime under Hosni Mubarak, having failed to democratize, collapsed in the face of massive protest.	在埃及，未能实现民主化的胡斯尼·穆巴拉克旧政权最终在大规模示威下倒台。
A low-turnout election gave a plurality of the popular vote to the Muslim Brotherhood, which came to power alone and proceeded to ignore good governance and alienate all except its most fervent followers.	一场投票率低下的大选让穆斯林兄弟会夺得了多数，随后该党派独立执政并开始忽略良好治理，疏远除了自身狂热支持者之外的所有人。
The Brotherhood’s approach to governance also explains the mess it made of the economy.	兄弟会的治理方式同时也解释了他们为何会把经济搞得一团遭。
Instead of trying to build non-partisan and competent regulatory institutions, all positions were stacked with political followers.	他们不去建立一个中立而称职的监管机构，而是把所有位置都分给了自己的政治支持者。
Unfortunately, the military intervention last July gave rise to yet another regime that seems unable to build durable institutions that could foster political reconciliation and deliver inclusive growth.	不幸的是，去年7月的军队干涉也仅仅是扶持了另一个无力构建长期性机制的政权，自然也无法去孕育政治和解并实现包容性增长。
Tunisia may give us an example of the opposite scenario: a real constitutional compromise supported by an overwhelming majority (reflected in a 200-16 vote in the National Constituent Assembly).	而突尼斯则呈现给我们另一片景象：一场由绝大多数议员所支持的真正的宪法妥协（制宪会议中200票赞成对16票反对 ） 。
If that compromise holds, stability will take hold, markets will function, Tunisia will attract investment, and tourism will thrive again.	如果这一妥协能维持下去，国家就将实现稳定，市场恢复运作，突尼斯也将在再次成为投资和旅游热点。
At the heart of the difference between the two cases is a vision of governance that makes such compromise possible.	而这两个国家的核心区别就是是否拥有一个可以实现政治妥协的治理理念。
Such a vision presupposes an assurance that a winner-take-all system will not be established, as well as broad agreement that regulatory institutions should be reasonably non-partisan and staffed with competent professionals.	这一理念的存在意味着确保不会出现一个赢家通吃的政治体制，同时也广泛认同监管机构应当保持合理中立而其成员高度专业的理念。
China’s long-lasting success is sometimes given as a counterexample to the importance of good governance for economic performance.	但中国的长期繁荣却在某种程度上提供了一个良好治理对经济成效重要性的反例。
The Chinese example certainly calls into question a strong correlation between multi-party democracy and economic growth.	中国显然令人对那些多党制民主和经济增长之间的强相关关系产生了怀疑。
Democracy is of course something valuable in itself and can be desired independently of its effect on economic growth.	民主制度显然本身就具有某种价值，而且不管对其对经济增长的有无作用都值得追求。
But, in the context of economic performance, it is important to emphasize that there is a huge difference between dictatorial regimes, where a single individual monopolizes all power – à la Mubarak or Syrian President Bashar al-Assad – and China, where there has been competition and contestability within a large communist party.	但在经济表现的语境下，应该重点强调那些一人霸占所有权力的独裁政权 — — 比如埃及的穆巴拉克和叙利亚的阿萨德 — — 与中国这样一个在庞大的共产党内部存在竞争和讨论的体制。
And it is the party, operating as a fairly inclusive and meritocratic institution, not an autocratic leader, that has governed in the post-Mao period.	在毛泽东时代过去后，中共是作为一个相当包容而且精英的体制在运作，而不是一人之下万人之上。
Lack of reasonably independent regulation and competent public administration – or, worse, one-person dictatorships – lead inexorably to economic waste and inefficiency, and eventually to political turmoil.	缺乏适当独立的监管和称职的公共行政机构 — — 或是更糟糕的一人专制��—无可避免地导致经济上的浪费和低效，最后引发政治风波。
This is true even in cases like Venezuela, where large oil revenues masked the underlying weakness for a while.	这在委内瑞拉这样在短期内用巨额石油收入掩盖了潜在缺陷的国家也是如此。
In the complex global economy of the twenty-first century, sustained good economic performance requires a panoply of well-functioning institutions that do not fall within a single leader’s purview.	在21世纪的复杂全球经济下，长期持续的良好经济成效取决于一整套运作良好的机制，不可被一个单一领导人所左右。
For example, successful economies require a reasonably independent central bank, and competent bank supervision that does not get dragged into short term politics.	比如说，成功的经济体育要一个相对独立的央行，以及一个不会陷入短期政治的称职银行银行监管机制。
They also need regulatory agencies in sectors such as telecommunications and energy that can pursue policies in accordance with broad goals established by the political process, but with appointees selected according to nonpartisan criteria who then exercise their authority in a way that fosters competition open to all.	它们同时还需要在电信或能源部门建立一些监管机构，这些机构既可以执行一些与政治进程宏大目标相适应的政策，但又必须拥有一批不被党派左右，可以利用自身的权力去促进公开竞争的官员。
When credit decisions, public procurement, construction contracts, and price determination reflect only short-term and purely political goals, good economic performance becomes impossible – even in countries with large natural-resource endowments.	当信贷决策，政府采购，建设合同和价格设定仅仅是短期和单纯政治目的的体现，良好的经济成效就不可能实现 — — 即便是在那些资源资源丰富的国家。
In countries with little or no such endowments – where innovation, competitive efficiency, and a focus on production rather than rents is all the more important – the lack of good governance will lead to failure more rapidly.	在那些资源缺乏的国家 — — 创新，竞争效率和对生产力的关注在这里变得更为重要 — — 没有好的治理就只会堕落得越快。
All of this implies that analyzing the determinants of economic success is a subject not just for economists.	所有这一切都意味着分析力经济成功地决定因素并不仅仅是经济学家的任务。
Why do some societies achieve the compromises needed to sustain an independent judiciary and a modern regulatory framework – both necessary for an efficient modern economy – while others perpetuate a partisan, winner-take-all approach to governance that weakens public policy and erodes private-sector confidence?	为什么某些社会能达成一个支撑现代高效经济体所必需的司法独立和现代监管框架的妥协，而其他国家则长期党同伐异，赢者通吃，最终损害了公共政策并令私人投资者失去信心？
The contrast is starkest in emerging countries, but differences also exist among the advanced economies.	这些对比在新兴市场国家最为明显，但差别同样出现在发达国家之间。
Perhaps Germany’s ability to reach sociopolitical compromise – again demonstrated by the formation of a right-left coalition after the 2013 elections – has been more fundamental to its recent economic success than the details of the fiscal and structural policies it has pursued to achieve it.	或许相对于一些细节性的财政和经济结构政策，德国实现社会政治妥协的能力 — — 在2013年大选后左右联合政府上再度体现出来 — — 才是实现最近一系列经济成就的更基础性因素？
	
The Cuban Missile Crisis at 50	50年代的古巴导弹危机
CAMBRIDGE – This month marks the 50th anniversary of the Cuban missile crisis – those 13 days in October 1962 that were probably the closest the world has come to a major nuclear war.	坎布里奇 — — 本月是古巴导弹危机50周年纪念日 — — 1962年10月的这13天或许是有史以来世界最接近一场全面核战争的时刻。
President John F. Kennedy had publicly warned the Soviet Union not to introduce offensive missiles into Cuba.	约翰·F·肯尼迪总统已经公开警告苏联不要向古巴部署攻击性导弹。
But Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev decided to cross Kennedy’s red line surreptitiously and confront the Americans with a fait accompli.	可苏联领导人尼基塔·赫鲁晓夫决定偷偷越过肯尼迪划出的红线，看看美国人面对既成事实会怎么办。
When an American surveillance plane discovered the missiles, the crisis erupted.	美国侦察机发现导弹之后，危机全面爆发。
Some of Kennedy’s advisers urged an air strike and invasion to destroy the missiles.	肯尼迪某些顾问敦促发动空袭和入侵来销毁导弹。
Kennedy mobilized troops, but also bought time by announcing a naval blockade of Cuba.	肯尼迪调集了部队，但同时宣布对古巴实施海上封锁来争取时间。
The crisis subsided when Soviet ships carrying additional missiles turned back, and Khrushchev agreed to remove the existing missiles from the island.	携带后续导弹的苏联船只掉头返回后危机逐渐消退，赫鲁晓夫也答应移走岛上已有的导弹。
As then US Secretary of State Dean Rusk put it: “We were eyeball to eyeball, and I think the other fellow just blinked.”	正如时任美国国务卿迪安·腊斯克所言 ： “ 双方的相互对峙最终以对方的退缩而告结束 。 ”
At first glance, this was a rational and predictable outcome.	乍看之下，这是一个可以合理预见的结果。
The United States had a 17-to-1 advantage in nuclear weaponry.	美国拥有的核武器优势为17比1。
The Soviets were simply outgunned.	简直可以用势单力薄来形容苏联人。
And yet the US did not preemptively attack Soviet missile sites, which were relatively vulnerable, because the risk that even one or two of the Soviet missiles would be fired at an American city was enough to deter a first strike.	但美国并没有先发制人地打击苏联相对脆弱的导弹基地，因为即使只有一两枚苏联导弹打向美国城市也足以阻止美国首先发起进攻。
In addition, both Kennedy and Khrushchev feared that rational strategies and careful calculation might spin out of control.	此外，肯尼迪和赫鲁晓夫都担心理性的战略和谨慎的计算可能会最终失控。
Khrushchev offered a vivid metaphor in one of his letters to Kennedy: “We and you ought not now to pull on the ends of the rope in which you have tied the knot of war.”	赫鲁晓夫在寄给肯尼迪的信中做了一个生动的比喻 ： “ ��我双方现在都不该扯动打着战争之结的绳索 。 ”
In 1987, I was part of a group of scholars that met at Harvard University with Kennedy’s surviving advisers to study the crisis.	1987年，我参与了哈佛大学与肯尼迪依然健在的顾问见面研究这场危机的学者团。
Robert McNamara, Kennedy’s secretary of defense, said he became more cautious as the crisis unfolded.	时任肯尼迪国防部长罗伯特·麦克纳马拉表示随着危机逐渐展开，他自己也变得越来越谨慎。
At the time, he thought that the probability of nuclear war resulting from the crisis might have been one in 50 (though he rated the risk much higher after he learned in the 1990’s that the Soviets had already delivered nuclear weapons to Cuba).	当时他曾认为危机引发核战争的可能性是五十分之一（尽管20世纪90年代获悉苏联已将核武器运抵古巴后，麦克纳马拉大幅提高了自己的风险评分 ） 。
Douglas Dillon, Kennedy’s treasury secretary, said he thought that the risk of nuclear war had been about zero.	时任肯尼迪财政部长道格拉斯·狄龙曾说他认为核战争的危险约等于零。
He did not see how the situation could possibly have escalated to nuclear war, and thus had been willing to push the Soviets harder and to take more risks than McNamara was.	他看不出局势怎么可能升级为核战争，因此他比麦克纳马拉更愿意冒险向苏联进一步施压。
General Maxwell Taylor, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also believed that the risk of nuclear war was low, and he complained that the US let the Soviet Union off too easily.	参谋长联席会议主席马克斯韦尔·泰勒将军也认为核战争的风险很低，并因此抱怨美国太过轻易地放过了苏联。
He felt that the Americans should have removed the Castro regime.	他认为这本来是美国人推翻卡斯特罗政权的好时机。
But the risks of losing control of the situation weighed heavily on Kennedy, too, which is why he took a more prudent position than some of his advisers would have liked.	但局势失控的风险也深深困扰着肯尼迪，他也因此采取了比某些顾问希望的更加谨慎的姿态。
The moral of the story is that a little nuclear deterrence goes a long way.	故事的核心思想是一点点核威慑所起到的作用也不容小觑。
Nonetheless, there are still ambiguities about the missile crisis that make it difficult to attribute the outcome entirely to the nuclear component.	尽管如此，这场导弹危机仍然存在含混之处，因此其中的核元素很难完全解释最终的结果。
The public consensus was that the US won.	公众普遍认为美国是这场危机的赢家。
But how much the US won, and why it won, is hard to determine.	但谁都难以说清美国为什么会赢、又赢了多少。
There are at least two possible explanations of the outcome, in addition to Soviet acquiescence to America’s superior nuclear firepower.	除去苏联默许美国拥有优势核火力之外，至少还有两种解释可以导致同样的结果。
One focuses on the importance of the two superpowers’ relative stakes in the crisis: the US not only had a greater stake in neighboring Cuba than the Soviets did, but could also bring conventional forces to bear.	一种偏重于两个超级大国在危机中相对利益的重要程度：与苏联相比美国不仅在邻国古巴拥有更大的利益，还可以更多地利用传统军事力量。
The naval blockade and the possibility of a US invasion strengthened the credibility of American deterrence, placing the psychological burden on the Soviets.	海上封锁和美国入侵的可能性增强了美国威慑的可信度，因此将心理负担推给了苏联一方。
The other explanation questions the very premise that the Cuban missile crisis was an outright US victory.	另一种解释质疑了美国在古巴危机中取得完胜的前提条件。
The Americans had three options: a “shoot-out” (bomb the missile sites); a “squeeze out” (blockade Cuba to convince the Soviets to withdraw the missiles); and a “buyout” (give the Soviets something they want).	美国当时面临三种选择：一种是“全面开战（轰炸导弹基地 ） ； 一种是“挤出 ” （ 封锁古巴迫使苏联撤出导弹 ） ； 最后一种是“收买 ” （ 给苏联某些想要的东西作为交换 ） 。
For a long time, the participants said little about the buyout aspects of the solution.	很长一段时间以来，鲜有参与者提到过解决方案的收买层面。
But subsequent evidence suggests that a quiet US promise to remove its obsolete missiles from Turkey and Italy was probably more important than was thought at the time (the US also gave a public assurance that it would not invade Cuba).	但随后的证据表明收买因素比人们当时所想的更加重要，美国暗中承诺从土耳其和意大利撤出过期导弹（美国还当众保证不会入侵古巴 ） 。
We can conclude that nuclear deterrence mattered in the crisis, and that the nuclear dimension certainly figured in Kennedy’s thinking.	我们可以认定核威慑在此次危机当中至关重要，并且核问题肯定曾在肯尼迪的思考过程中出现。
But it was not the ratio of nuclear weapons that mattered so much as the fear that even a few nuclear weapons would wreak intolerable devastation.	但真正重要的并不是核武器的比例，而是担心少量核武器也会造成令人无法忍受的破坏。
How real were these risks?	核威胁的风险究竟有多大？
On October 27, 1962, just after Soviet forces in Cuba shot down a US surveillance plane (killing the pilot), a similar plane taking routine air samples near Alaska inadvertently violated Soviet air space in Siberia.	1962年10月27日，就在苏联军队刚刚在古巴击落一架美国侦察机（导致飞行员丧生）后不久，一架类似的飞机在阿拉斯加附近常规搜集空气样本时无意间侵犯了苏联的西伯利亚领空。
Fortunately, it was not shot down.	幸运的是，这架飞机并未被击落。
But, even more serious, unbeknownst to the Americans, Soviet forces in Cuba had been instructed to repel a US invasion, and had been authorized to use their tactical nuclear weapons to do so.	但还有更严重的事实并不为美国人所知，驻古巴的苏联军队已经接到使用战术核武器击退美国的入侵的指令。
It is hard to imagine that such a nuclear attack would have remained merely tactical.	很难想象这样的核攻击能仅仅停留在战术层面。
Kenneth Waltz, an American scholar, recently published an article entitled “Why Iran Should Get the Bomb.”	美国学者肯尼思·沃尔兹最近发表了一篇文章，题目是“伊朗为什么应该得到炸弹 。 ”
In a rational, predictable world, such an outcome might produce stability.	在可以预测的理性世界，这样的结果可能会带来稳定。

Social Choice and Social Welfare	社会选择与社会福利
CAMBRIDGE – Human beings have always lived in groups, and their individual lives have invariably depended on group decisions.	剑桥—人类一直生活在群体中，他们的个体生活总是取决于群体选择。
But the challenges of group choice can be daunting, particularly given the divergent interests and concerns of the group’s members.	但群体选择的挑战也许令人畏缩，特别是考虑到群体成员之间利益与关注点的分歧。
So, how should collective decision-making be carried out?	那么，集体决策应该如何进行？
A dictator who wants to control every aspect of people’s lives will seek to ignore the preferences of everyone else.	希望掌握人们生活方方面面的独裁者会寻求忽略所有其他人的偏好。
But that level of power is hard to achieve.	但如此水平的权力很难获得。
More important, dictatorship of any kind can readily be seen to be a terrible way to govern a society.	更重要的是，任何类型的独裁都天生被视为恐怖的治理社会方式。
So, for both ethical and practical reasons, social scientists have long investigated how the concerns of a society’s members can be reflected in one way or another in its collective decisions, even if the society is not fully democratic.	因此，出于伦理和实际理由，社会科学家长期以来一直在研究社会成员的关注点如何以某种方式反映于集体决策中，即使该社会非完全民主的社会。
For example, in the fourth century BC, Aristotle in Greece and Kautilya in India explored various possibilities of social choice in their classic books, Politics and Economics, respectively (the Sanskrit title of Kautilya’s book, Arthashastra, translates literally as “the discipline of material wellbeing”).	比如，在公元前四世纪，希腊的亚里士多德和印度的考底利耶（Kautilya）就分别在各自的经典著作《政治学 》 （ Politics）和《经济学 》 （ Economics）中探索了社会选择的各种可能性。 （考底利耶著作的梵文标题为Arthashastra，直译过来就是“关于物质财富的学科 ” ） 。
The study of social choice as a formal discipline first came into its own in the late eighteenth century, when the subject was pioneered by French mathematicians, particularly J. C. Borda and Marquis de Condorcet.	社会选择研究第一次步入正式学科是在十九世纪末，先驱式法国数学家，主要包括波尔达（J. C. Borda）和马奎斯·孔多塞（Marquis de Condorcet ） 。
The intellectual climate of the time was greatly influenced by the European Enlightenment, with its interest in reasoned construction of a social order, and its commitment to the creation of a society responsive to people’s preferences.	当时的知识界气候受欧洲文艺复兴的巨大影响，人们对理性的社会秩序的构建兴趣浓厚，开始致力于创建响应人民偏好的社会。
But the theoretical investigations of Borda, Condorcet, and others often yielded rather pessimistic results.	但波尔达、孔多塞和其他人的理论研究常常指向悲观结果。
For example, the so-called “voting paradox” presented by Condorcet showed that majority rule can reach an impasse when every alternative is defeated in voting by some other alternative, so that no alternative is capable of standing up to the challenge of every other alternative.	比如，孔多塞提出的所谓的“投票悖论”表明多数统治可能陷入僵局，出现每一种方案都被其他方案在选举中击败的情况，以至于没有一种方案能够战胜其他所有方案的挑战。
Social choice theory in its modern and systematic form owes its rigorous foundation to the work of Kenneth J. Arrow in his 1950 Columbia University PhD dissertation.	现代、系统性的社会选择理论的一个主要基础是肯尼斯·阿罗（Kenneth J. Arrow）在其1950年哥伦比亚大学的博士论文中做出的工作。
Arrow’s thesis contained his famous “impossibility theorem,” an analytical result of breathtaking elegance and reach.	阿罗的论文包括了著名的“不可能定理 ” ， 这一分析结果优美无比，也深邃无比。
Arrow’s theorem shows that even very mild conditions of reasonableness in arriving at social decisions on the basis of simple preference rankings of a society’s individuals could not be simultaneously satisfied by any procedure.	阿罗的定理证明，对于以社会中个人的简单偏好排序为基础形成社会决策这一问题，即使是弱理性条件也无法通过任何程序（procedure）同时获得满足。
When the book based on his dissertation, Social Choice and Individual Values, was published in 1951, it became an instant classic.	以其博士论文为基础的《社会选择与个人价值 》 （ Social Choice and Individual Values）出版于1951年，立刻就成为经典著作。
Economists, political theorists, moral and political philosophers, sociologists, and even the general public rapidly took notice of what seemed like – and indeed was – a devastating result.	经济学家、政治理论家、道德和政治哲学家、社会学家、甚至普罗大众很快就注意到了这个似乎 — — 也确实是 — — 灾难性的结果。
Two centuries after visions of social rationality flowered in Enlightenment thinking, the project suddenly seemed, at least superficially, to be inescapably doomed.	在社会理性观点借助文艺复兴思想发展了两个世纪之后，这项大工程突然走向了无可避免的倒塌 — — 至少从表面看是如此。
It is important to understand why and how Arrow’s impossibility result comes about.	理解阿罗不可能定理为何会出现、如何出现十分重要。
Scrutiny of the formal reasoning that establishes the theorem shows that relying only on the preference rankings of individuals makes it difficult to distinguish between very dissimilar social choice problems.	对建立该定理的正式推理的仔细审读表明，只依赖个体偏好顺序导致很难区分截然不同的社会选择问题。
The usability of available information is further reduced by the combined effects of innocuous-seeming principles that are popular in informal discussions.	易得信息的可用性因为在非正式讨论中十分流行的看似无伤大雅的各种原则的组合效应而进一步削弱了。
It is essential, particularly for making judgments about social welfare, to compare different individuals’ gains and losses and to take note of their relative affluence, which cannot be immediately deduced only from people’s rankings of social alternatives.	比较不同个体的利益和损失、注意他们的相对丰裕程度（这无法通过人们对社会方案的排序立刻推得）是至关重要的，特别是在做出关于社会福利的判断方面。
It is also important to examine which types of clusters of preference rankings are problematic for different types of voting procedures.	同样重要的是考察哪些类型的偏好排列窜（cluster）对于不同类型的投票程序有问题。
Nonetheless, Arrow’s impossibility theorem ultimately played a hugely constructive role in investigating what democracy demands, which goes well beyond counting votes (important as that is).	尽管如此，阿罗的不可能定理最终在研究民主要求什么的问题上扮演了巨大的建设性角色，这一问题远远超过了点算票数的范围（尽管这也很重要 ） 。
Enriching the informational base of democracy and making greater use of interactive public reasoning can contribute significantly to making democracy more workable, and also allow reasoned assessment of social welfare.	丰富民主的信息基础、让互动型公共推理排上更大用场可以极大地增强民主的可运作性，也让社会福利的理性评估成为可能。
Social choice theory has thus become a broad discipline, covering a variety of distinct questions.	因此，社会选择理论是一门广阔的科学，覆盖了大量不同问题。
Under what circumstances would majority rule yield unambiguous and consistent decisions?	在何种环境下多数同志能产生不含糊的一致性决策？
How robust are the different voting procedures for yielding cogent results?	产生令人信服结果的不同投票程序的鲁棒性如何？
How can we judge how well a society as a whole is doing in light of its members’ disparate interests?	我们如何判断社会作为一个整体在其成员利益完全不相干的情况下运行的如何？
How, moreover, can we accommodate individuals’ rights and liberties while giving appropriate recognition to their overall preferences?	此外，我们能够在协调个人权利与自由同时给予他们的总体偏好以恰当的承认？
How do we measure aggregate poverty in view of the varying predicaments and miseries of the diverse people who comprise the society?	我们如何在度量总贫困水平时顾及组成社会的不同的人所经历的不同窘况和苦难？
How do we arrive at social valuations of public goods such as the natural environment?	我们如何形成对自然环境等公共品的社会评估？
Beyond these questions, a theory of justice can draw substantially on the insights and analytical results emerging from social choice theory (as I discussed in my 2009 book The Idea of Justice).	除了这些问题，关于正义的理论可以深刻影响来自社会选择理论的洞见和分析结果（我在2009年的著作《正义观念 》 （ The Idea of Justice）中讨论了这一点 ） 。
Furthermore, the understanding generated by social choice theorists’ study of group decisions has helped some research that is not directly a part of social choice theory – for example, on the forms and consequences of gender inequality, or on the causation and prevention of famines.	此外，来自社会选择理论家对群体决策的研究的理解帮助了一些并非直接属于社会选择理论的研究 — — 比如对性别不平等的后果的形式的研究、对饥荒的成因和预防的研究等。
The reach and relevance of social choice theory is extensive.	社会选择理论的深度和重要性是巨大的。
Rather than undermining the pursuit of social reasoning, Arrow’s deeply challenging impossibility theorem, and the large volume of literature that it has inspired, has immensely strengthened our ability to think rationally about the collective decision-making on which our survival and happiness depend.	形成深刻挑战的阿罗不可能定理及其所启发的大量文献并未阻碍对社会理性的追求，而是大大增强了我们理性地思考作为我们的生存和幸福基础的集体决策的能力。
	
What’s the Problem With Advanced Economies?	发达经济体出了什么问题？
CAMBRIDGE – Is today’s slow growth in advanced economies a continuation of long-term secular decline, or does it reflect the normal aftermath of a deep systemic financial crisis?	美国剑桥—发达经济体目前的低增长是长期衰落的延续，还是反映了深度系统性金融危机后的常态？
More important, do we need to answer that question definitively in order to boost the pace of economic recovery?	更重要的是，为了提振经济增长速度，我们需要对这个问题做出确定的回答吗？
At a recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) conference, former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers argued that today’s growth blues have deep roots that pre-date the global financial crisis.	在最近的国际货币基金组织（IMF）会议上，前美国财政部长萨默斯（Lawrence Summers）指出，现今的增长萎靡在全球金融危机之前就埋下了祸根。
Summers placed particular emphasis on the need for more infrastructure investment, a sentiment that most economists wholeheartedly share, especially if one is referring to genuinely productive investment.	萨默斯特别强调了需要进行更多的基础设施投资，大部分经济学家都十分支持这一��法，特别是真正的生产性投资。
Others also certainly worry about secular decline, though most have emphasized the supply side rather than the demand side.	显然也有人担心长期衰落，尽管大部分强调的是供给面而不是需求面。
The economist Jeffrey Sachs, for example, has argued that the US economy needs to confront a plethora of structural impediments to sustained growth, including offshoring, skill mismatches, and decaying infrastructure.	比如，经济学家萨克斯（Jeffrey Sachs）指出，美国经济需要面临太多的可持续增长的结构性障碍，包括离岸化、技能错配和基础设施陈旧。
The Internet entrepreneur Peter Thiel and the legendary chess champion Garry Kasparov have suggested that the malaise runs even deeper, as has the economist Robert Gordon.	互联网创业家提尔（Peter Thiel）和国际象棋传奇卡斯帕罗夫认为经济萎靡更加严重，经济学家戈登（Robert Gordon）亦作如是观。
They argue that the technology engine that has driven mankind from one economic plateau to the next over the past 200 years is running out of steam.	他们指出，在过去200年中引领人类从一个经济高原走向另一个经济高原的技术引擎正在失去动力。
Simply put, the Internet may be cool, but it is hardly as essential as running water, electrification, or the internal combustion engine.	简言之，互联网看起来很酷，但根本不能和蒸汽机、电气化和内燃机相提并论。
The Gordon-Kasparov-Thiel thesis is extremely interesting, though I have challenged their negative conclusions, both in print and in a debate at Oxford.	戈登-卡斯帕罗夫-提尔理论非常有趣，尽管我撰文并在牛津的讨论会上挑战了他们的消极推论。
Personally, I think the greater risk is that the pace of technological progress will accelerate too much for societies to adapt, though the experience so far has basically been positive.	就个人而言，我认为更大的风险在于技术进步的速度增加得太快，使社会难以适应，尽管到目前为止的经验从根本上说都是积极的。
Certainly, today’s advanced economies urgently need to address all kinds of technological, social, and political deficiencies.	显然，如今发达经济体急切地需要纠正各种技术、社会和政治缺陷。
Nevertheless, the subpar growth of the past half-decade still bears all the hallmarks of a typical sluggish recovery from a deep systemic financial crisis, as Carmen Reinhart and I documented in our 2009 book This Time is Different.	尽管如此，过去五年来的增长不振仍表现出深度系统性金融危机后增长停滞的全部典型特征，我和莱因哈特（Carmen Reinhart）在2009年的著作《这次不一样 》 （ This Time is Different）中描述了这些特征。
Of course, structural reform is essential after a financial crisis, as are policies to maintain aggregate demand while the economy heals.	当然，金融危机后，结构性改革是不必可少的，在经济复原时维持总需求的政策亦然。
To my mind, the biggest failure of post-2008 economic policy has consisted in governments’ inability to find creative ways to write down unsustainable debts, for example in US mortgage markets, and in Europe’s periphery.	在我看来，2008年后的经济政策最大的失败之处在于政府无法找到减记不可持续的债务的创新办法，如美国按揭市场和欧洲外围国家债务。
This includes the failure to issue public debt where necessary to facilitate restructuring, particularly if overall economy-wide (or eurozone-wide) debt could be reduced in the same operation.	这其中包括了没有在必要时发行公债促进重组，特别是在全经济（或全欧元区）债务可以同时减少的情况下。
But Summers is certainly right that productive infrastructure investment is the low-hanging fruit.	但萨默斯认为生产性基础设施投资是唾手可得的成果毫无疑问是正确的。
Of course, governments should be concerned about the long-term trajectory of public debt, all politically charged and polemical nonsense to the contrary.	当然，政府应该关注公债的长期走势、所有带政治色彩的反对意见和无意义的争论。
But productive infrastructure investment that generates long-term growth pays for itself, so there need not be any conflict between short-term stabilization and risks to long-term debt sustainability.	但有利于增长的生产性基础设施投资自会产生成效，因此在这方面不应该有任何短期稳定和长期债务可持续性风险之间的冲突。
With today’s ultra-low interest rates and high unemployment, public investment is cheap and plenty of projects offer high returns: fixing bridges and roads, updating badly outmoded electricity grids, and improving mass-transportation systems, to take just a few notable examples.	如今，利率处于极低水平，而失业处于极高水平，公共投资十分廉价，并且有足够多的可提供高回报的项目：架桥修路、升级陈旧损坏的电网、改善大众交通系统，等等（以上只是几个显著的例子 ） 。
I appreciate that there are those who take on faith that Keynesian multipliers are much bigger than one, implying that even wasteful government spending is productive.	有人相信凯恩斯乘数远大于一，也就是说，即使是浪费性质的政府支出也是生产性的，我同意这一点。
But, given thin empirical evidence and legitimate concerns about undermining trust in the effectiveness of government, and with so many options for the productive use of resources, this seems like a titanic ideological distraction.	但是，由于实证证据较少以及关于破坏对效果和政府的信任的合理担忧，并且我们有许多选择可以把资源用於生产性用途，因此这似乎是对思想统一的极大干扰。
It is also far from clear why virtually all infrastructure needs to be publicly financed.	另一个远未得到澄清的问题是为何几乎所有基础设施都需要通过公共融资。
There are still huge pools of private wealth sitting on the sidelines that can be rapidly mobilized to support productive infrastructure.	有大量私人财富可以快速动员以支持生产性基础设施。
The government needs to help with rights of way before construction, and with strong regulation to protect the public interest afterwards.	政府需要在建设之前帮助厘清路权，并在道路建成后采取强有力的监管保护公众利益。
In his first term in office, US President Barack Obama suggested the creation of an infrastructure bank to help promote public-private partnerships.	在其第一个任期内，美国总统奥巴马提出成立基础设施银行促进公私合作。
It is still a good idea, particularly if the bank maintained a professional staff to help guide public choice on costs and benefits (including environmental costs and benefits).	这依然是个好主意，特别是在银行拥有专业人员可以帮助计算公共选择的成本收益（包括环境成本和收益）的情况下。
Even if Keynesian multipliers are truly at the upper end of consensus, mobilizing private capital for investment has most of the advantages of issuing public debt.	即使凯恩斯乘数确实高到共识的上限，动员私人资本进行投资也具有发行过公债的绝大部分优点。
One qualification is in order.	有一种观点很有市场。
Some commentators have suggested that the root cause of secular decline, as well as the main explanation of ultra-low interest rates, is low fertility throughout the advanced world.	一些评论者指出，长期衰落的根源 — — 以及超低利率的主要解释 — — 是发达国家的低生育率。
If true, the case for any kind of investment, public or private, would be more mixed; there must be labor to use the capital.	如果这一看法正确，那么投资的问题 — — 不管是私人投资还是公共投资 — — 就会变得更加复杂；必须要有人来使用资本。
But I suspect that the drivers of today’s slow growth and low interest rates go far beyond low fertility rates, in which case this should not be an obstacle.	但我怀疑现今的低增长和低利率远远不是低生育率所能解释的，低生育率不应该成为障碍。
The important point is that the case for expanding productive infrastructure investment does not rest on one narrow ideological viewpoint or economic theory.	要点在于扩张生产性基础设施投资的问题并不是狭隘的经济学理论思想问题。
Whether Summers is right about secular stagnation in advanced economies, or whether we are still mainly suffering the aftermath of the financial crisis, it is time to break the political gridlock and restore growth.	不管萨默斯关于发达经济体的长期停滞的观点是否正确，也不管我们是否仍在经历金融危机的后遗症，现在都应该打破政治僵局、重塑增长。
	
A Surplus of Controversy	争论盈余
CAMBRIDGE – When the US Treasury recently added its voice to the chorus of critics of Germany’s chronic current-account surplus, it underscored the deep disagreement over what, if anything, should be done about it.	美国剑桥—美国财政部最近提高了对德国长期经常项目盈余的批评声音，这凸显出关于如何应对这一问题的深刻分歧。
The critics want Germany to increase its contribution to global demand by importing more and exporting less.	批评者想要德国增加进口、减少出口，从而为全球需求做出更大贡献。
The Germans view the maintenance of strong balance sheets as essential to their country’s stabilizing role in Europe.	德国人则认为维护其强劲的国际收支盈余对于德国在欧洲扮演稳定者角色至关重要。
Both sides’ arguments will certainly receive a full airing at the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.	双方观点都必定会在国际货币基金组织（IMF）和世界银行的春季会议上获得充分的支持。
Unfortunately, the debate has too often been informed more by ideology than facts.	不幸的是，这场争论总是太多地披上了意识形态色彩，而太少关注事实。
The difference between what a country exports and imports can reflect myriad factors, including business cycles, demographics, investment opportunities, and economic diversification.	一国出口和进口之间的差额可以反映诸多原因，包括商业周期、人口结构、投资机会和经济多样化等。
It can also reflect the government’s penchant for running fiscal surpluses; after all, the current-account surplus, by definition, is the excess of public and private savings over investment.	它还可能反映了政府的财政盈余偏好；毕竟，经常项目盈余的定义是公共和私人储蓄超出投资的部分。
During the first half of the 2000’s, US policymakers chose not to worry about sustained current-account deficits, which peaked at above 6% of GDP.	在21世纪的第一个五年，美国决策者不担心持续的经���项目赤字（最高时超过了GDP的6%以上 ） 。
They argued at first that the deficits merely reflected the world’s attraction to superior US investment opportunities, an odd position given that the US was not growing especially quickly compared to emerging markets.	他们首先指出，盈余无非反映了世界对上佳美国投资机会的吸引力，考虑到美国的增长并不比新兴市场快，这一离场有些奇怪。
Later, academic researchers identified more plausible reasons why the US might be able to run large deficits without great risk, as long as investors’ desire for diversification, safety, and liquidity sustained global demand for US assets.	随后，学术研究者找到了关于美国为何可以维持巨大赤字而不招致巨大风险的更合理的理由：投资者对多样化、安全性和流动性的渴望维持了美国资产的全球需求。
But policymakers should have recognized that even these better rationales had limits, and that massive sustained current-account deficits are often a blinking red signal of deeper problems – in this case, over-borrowing by households to finance home purchases.	但决策者应该认识到，即便这一更好的理由也有局限性，持续大规模经常项目盈余通常是更深层次问题的警示信号 — — 在当时的美国是家庭为融资买房而进行的过度借贷。
In the case of Germany, of course, we are talking about surpluses, not deficits.	当然，在德国的问题上，我们讨论的是盈余而不是赤字。
And even though the surpluses exceed 6% of German national income and would seem to be on the same order of magnitude as pre-crisis US deficits, one must remember that the German economy is less than a quarter the size of the US (at market exchange rates).	虽然盈余超过了德国国民收入的6 % ， 已骎骎然与危机前美国赤字水平相当，但是别忘了，德国经济规模还不到美国的四分之一（按市场汇率衡量 ） 。
However, as the Center for European Policy Studies’ Daniel Gros has pointed out, the issue is not simply Germany.	但是，正如欧洲政策研究中心（Center for European Policy Studies）的丹尼尔·格罗斯（Daniel Gros）所指出的，这个问题并不只是德国的问题。
Smaller northern European countries, including the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, and Norway have been collectively running surpluses at least as large as Germany’s relative to national income, and, in absolute terms, their combined surpluses are even larger.	较小的北欧经集体，包括荷兰、瑞士、瑞典和挪威，总盈余占国民收入比与德国不想上相，若用绝对数字衡量则更有过之。
So the issue obviously merits attention.	因此，这一问题显然应该引起注意。
But what is the cause, and is it related to policy?	但原因何在？ 与政策有关系吗？
Certainly, no one can criticize northern Europe for exchange-rate undervaluation.	显然，我们不可能批评北欧汇率低估。
By almost any purchasing-power measure, the euro seems overvalued (and the Swiss franc even more so).	几乎从任何购买力标准衡量，欧元都是被高估的（瑞士法郎高估得更多 ） 。
Keynesians look at these surpluses and say that the northern European countries should drive them down by running much larger fiscal deficits to boost domestic demand.	凯恩斯主义者看到这些盈余会说，北欧国家应该通过增加财政赤字、提高内需来让盈余下降。
They have a point, but they grossly overstate the case.	他们的话不无道理，但他们把说的太自信了。
Many studies have shown that changes in private savings and investment tend to offset partly the current-account effects of higher fiscal deficits.	许多研究表明，私人储蓄和投资的变化倾向于抵消部分财政赤字的经常项目效应。
For example, larger German fiscal deficits would hardly have been a decisive factor in Europe.	比如，德国提高财政赤字几乎不可能成为欧洲的决定性因素。
Research by the IMF and others suggests that the demand spillovers from German fiscal policy to Europe are likely to be modest, particularly in the eurozone’s troubled countries, like Greece and Portugal.	IMF和其他机构的研究表明德国财政政策对欧洲的需求溢出效应可能十分微小，特别是对希腊和葡萄牙等欧元区受困经济体而言。
Germany trades with the entire world.	德国的贸易伙伴是全世界。
The European Commission has recently completed its own report on Germany’s surpluses, concluding that it is difficult to pin down the many factors underlying it, which of course is true.	欧盟委员会最近完成了其自身的德国盈余问题报告，认为很难一一确定其诸多因素，这毫无疑问是正确的。
For example, Germany’s capital-goods exporters have benefited enormously from growth in China.	比如，德国的资本商品商因为中国的增长而获益良多。
The Commission nonetheless argues persuasively that policies to promote public and private investment would tame the surpluses in the short term and strengthen German growth in the long term.	尽管如此，欧盟委员会令人信服地指出，刺激公共和私人投资的政策可以在短期减少盈余，在长期提振德国的增长。
One might add that there are still extensive impediments to competition in the service and retail sectors in many northern European countries.	还可以加上一点：许多北欧国家的服务和零售部门仍然存在巨大的竞争障碍。
Removing them would increase consumption of all goods, including imports.	消除这些障碍能够提高所有商品的消费，包括进口品。
And Germany is right to point out that its strong balance sheet underpins Europe’s fragile stability today.	德国指出其强劲的收支盈余状况体现了欧洲的脆弱现状，这也是正确的。
Would European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s vow in the summer of 2012 to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro have been nearly as effective if investors doubted Germany’s underlying financial strength and resolve?	如果投资者怀疑德国的金融基本面健康状况和决心，欧洲央行行长德拉吉在2012年夏所做出的“竭尽全力”拯救欧元的承诺还会如此有效吗？
At the same time, it is also true that Germany could have been more forthcoming and more liberal in using its balance sheet to defuse debt-overhang problems in periphery countries like Portugal and Greece, and perhaps even Ireland and Spain.	与此同时，同样正确的是，德国原本可能更容易、更慷慨地利用其收支盈余平息葡萄牙和希腊（也许还包括爱尔兰和西班牙）等外围国的债务积压问题。
The bottom line is that large sustained external imbalances are something that global policymakers do need to monitor closely, because, as the US housing bust showed, they can be an indicator of problems that need to be investigated more deeply.	总而言之，持续大规模外部失衡是全球决策这需要密切监控的问题，因为正如美国房地产泡沫破裂所标明的，它们可能是需要深度调查的问题的表征。
And critics of the surplus countries are right that there are two sides to every balance, and that policies in both surplus and deficit countries should be subject to review.	盈余国的批评者正确地指出，有盈余则必有赤字，盈余国和赤字国的政策都应该仔细检视。
But it is wrong to believe that simplistic answers, such as more fiscal stimulus or more austerity, are a panacea; more often, the underlying problems relate to debt, structural rigidities, low investment, and weak competitiveness.	但指望简单的答案 — — 如更多财政刺激或更多紧缩 — — 成为万灵丹是不正确的；在更多时候，根本问题与债务、结构僵化、投资不足和竞争力疲软有关。
	
The Exaggerated Death of Inflation	夸大其词的通胀之死
CAMBRIDGE – Is the era of high inflation gone forever?	发自剑桥 — — 高通胀时代已经一去不复返了吗？
In a world of slow growth, high debt, and tremendous distributional pressures, whether inflation is dead or merely dormant is an important question.	在一个增长缓慢，债务高企，分配压力巨大的世界，通货膨胀究竟是死了还是仅仅休眠是一个重要问题。
Yes, massive institutional improvements concerning central banks have created formidable barriers to high inflation.	没错，大量有关中央银行的制度改革针对高通胀建立了巨大的屏障。
But a significant part of a central bank’s credibility ultimately derives from the broader macroeconomic environment in which it operates.	但中央银行信誉的一个重要组成部分最终来自于其运作的宏观经济环境。
In the first half of the 1990s, annual inflation averaged 40% in Africa, 230% in Latin America, and 360% in the transition economies of Eastern Europe.	上世纪90年代前半期，非洲国家年通胀率平均为40 % ， 拉丁美洲为230 % ， 东欧转型经济体为360 % 。
And, in the early 1980s, advanced-economy inflation averaged nearly 10%.	而在80年代初，发达经济体的通胀率平均接近10 % 。
Today, high inflation seems so remote that many analysts treat it as little more than a theoretical curiosity.	今天，高通货膨胀看起来那么遥远，许多分析人士只把它当成一个理论上的玩意儿。
They are wrong to do so.	他们这么想是不对的。
No matter how much central banks may wish to present the level of inflation as a mere technocratic decision, it is ultimately a social choice.	无论中央银行如何希望显示出通胀水平仅仅是一个技术性的决定，但它最终还是一个社会选择。
And some of the very pressures that helped to contain inflation for the past two decades have been retreating.	而某些在过去二十年中有助于遏制通货膨胀的压力已经消退。
In the years preceding the financial crisis, increasing globalization and technological advances made it much easier for central banks to deliver both solid growth and low inflation.	在全球金融危机爆发前的几年，越来越多的全球化和技术进步使中央银行更易于实现硬增长和低通胀。
This was not the case in the 1970s, when stagnating productivity and rising commodity prices turned central bankers into scapegoats, not heroes.	这跟上世纪70年代不一样，当时停滞不前的生产力和上涨的商品价格使得中央银行成为替罪羊而非大明星。
True, back then, monetary authorities were working with old-fashioned Keynesian macroeconomic models, which encouraged the delusion that monetary policy could indefinitely boost the economy with low inflation and low interest rates.	毫无疑问，那时，货币机构用老派的凯恩斯主义宏观经济模型来工作，该模型鼓励产生这样一个错觉：货币政策可能会无限期在低通胀和低利率条件下刺激经济。
Central bankers today are no longer so naive, and the public is better informed.	中央银行今天已不再那么天真，公众也了解得更多。
But a country’s long-term inflation rate is still the outcome of political choices not technocratic decisions.	但是，一个国家的长期通胀率仍然是政治选择而非技术专家的决策结果。
As the choices become more difficult, the risk to price stability grows.	当选择变得更加困难，价格稳定的风险也不断增加。
A quick tour of emerging markets reveals that inflation is far from dead.	对新兴市场的快速浏览显示，通货膨胀远远没有��束。
According to the International Monetary Fund’s April 2014 World Economic Outlook, inflation in 2013 reached 6.2% in Brazil, 6.4% in Indonesia, 6.6% in Vietnam, 6.8% in Russia, 7.5% in Turkey, 8.5% in Nigeria, 9.5% in India, 10.6% in Argentina, and a whopping 40.7% in Venezuela.	国际货币基金组织2014年4月的《世界经济展望》指出，2013年巴西的通货膨胀率达到6.2 % ， 印度尼西亚6.4 % ， 越南6.6 % ， 俄罗斯6.8 % ， 土耳其7.5 % ， 尼日利亚8.5 % ， 印度9.5 % ， 阿根廷10.6 % ， 委内瑞拉高达40.7 % 。
These levels may be a big improvement from the early 1990s, but they certainly are not evidence of inflation’s demise.	这些水平比起上世纪90年代初可能是一大进步，但它们肯定不是通胀已死的证明。
Yes, advanced economies are in a very different position today, but they are hardly immune.	是的，今天的发达经济体处于不同的位置，但它们也在劫难逃。
Many of the same pundits who never imagined that advanced economies could have massive financial crises are now sure that advanced economies can never have inflation crises.	许多专家从未想过发达经济体会遭受大规模的金融危机，同样，专家现在也确信发达经济体可以没有通货膨胀危机。
More fundamentally, where, exactly, does one draw the line between advanced economies and emerging markets?	更重要的是，在哪里，确切地说，有谁为发达经济体和新兴市场之间划出了界线？
The eurozone, for example, is a blur.	例如，欧元区，是一个模糊的界限。
Imagine that there was no euro and that the southern countries had retained their own currencies – Italy with the lira, Spain with the peseta, Greece with the drachma, and so on.	试想如果那些南欧国家从未加入欧元并保留了自己货币 — — 意大利的里拉，西班牙的比塞塔，希腊的德拉克马等等。
Would these countries today have an inflation profile more like the United States and Germany or more like Brazil and Turkey?	这些国家现在的通货膨胀形势究竟会更像美国和德国，还是更像巴西和土耳其？
Most likely, they would be somewhere in between.	最有可能的是，它们会在两者之间。
The European periphery would have benefited from the same institutional advances in central banking as everyone else; but there is no particular reason to suppose that its political structures would have evolved in a radically different way.	欧洲外围国家将和其他人一样受益于中央银行制度的进步；但是没有特别的理由认为其政治结构会往一个完全不同的方向发展。
The public in the southern countries embraced the euro precisely because the northern countries’ commitment to price stability gave them a currency with enormous anti-inflation credibility.	南部国家的公众接受欧元正是因为北部国家对物价稳定的承诺给予了他们一个有着强大反通胀信誉的货币。
As it turned out, the euro was not quite the free lunch that it seemed to be.	事实证明，欧元并不是像它看起来那样是免费的午餐。
The gain in inflation credibility was offset by weak debt credibility.	在通货膨胀方面的信誉增益被不良的债务信誉所抵消。
If the European periphery countries had their own currencies, it is likely that debt problems would morph right back into elevated inflation.	如果欧洲外围国家有自己的货币，那么债务问题将很有可能会引发通胀上涨。
I am not arguing that inflation will return anytime soon in safe-haven economies such as the US or Japan.	我不认为通胀将很快回归经济安全港如美国和日本。
Though US labor markets are tightening, and the new Fed chair has emphatically emphasized the importance of maximum employment, there is still little risk of high inflation in the near future.	尽管美国的劳动力市场正在收紧，以及新任美联储主席着重强调就业最大化的重要性，但在不久的将来，高通货膨胀的风险依然很小。
Still, over the longer run, there is no guarantee that any central bank will be able to hold the line in the face of adverse shocks such as continuing slow productivity growth, high debt levels, and pressure to reduce inequality through government transfers.	然而从长远来看，没有人能保证任何中央银行将能够在面对不利冲击时保持通胀水平，例如持续的生产力增长放缓，高负债水平，以及通过政府转移支付减少不平等的压力。
The risk would be particularly high in the event of other major shocks – say, a general rise in global real interest rates.	风险会在遭受其他重大冲击时变得特别高 — — 例如说，全球实际利率的上升。
Recognizing that inflation is only dormant renders foolish the oft-stated claim that any country with a flexible exchange rate has nothing to fear from high debt, as long as debt is issued in its own currency.	认识到通胀率仅仅是休眠了，我们将看到“任何国家只要拥有灵活的汇率制度，以本国货币发行债务，就不必担心高负债”的通常想法是愚蠢的。
Imagine again that Italy had its own currency instead of the euro.	再次想象一下，如果意大利有自己的货币而不是欧元。
Certainly, the country would have much less to fear from an overnight run on debt.	当然，这个国家不用太担心一夜之间产生的债务。
Nevertheless, given the huge governance problems that Italy still faces, there is every chance that its inflation rate would look more like Brazil’s or Turkey’s, with any debt problems spilling over faster price growth.	然而，由于巨大的治理问题，意大利仍然很有可能因为债务问题溢出快于价格增长而面临像巴西或土耳其那样的通胀率。
Modern central banking has worked wonders to bring down inflation.	现代中央银行已经在降低通胀上创造了奇迹。
Ultimately, however, a central bank’s anti-inflation policies can work only within the context of a macroeconomic and political framework that is consistent with price stability.	然而最终，央行的反通胀政策只能在符合价格稳定的背景下，在宏观经济和政治框架内运作。
Inflation may be dormant, but it is certainly not dead.	通货膨胀可能处于休眠状态，但它肯定并未消亡。
	
The 4% Non-Solution	4%不是灵药
PARIS – For some time now, there has been concern that central bankers have “run out of bullets.”	巴黎—一段时间以来，有一种声音认为央行行长们已经“黔驴技穷 ” 。
Having lowered their policy rates to near zero, they have engaged in increasingly extravagant measures such as “quantitative easing” and “forward guidance.”	他们已将政策利率降至近零水平，越来越多地采取了“量化宽松”和“前瞻性指引”等“大招 ” 。
Given the fog cast over real economic activity by the financial crisis, it is difficult to offer a definitive assessment of just how well or badly those measures have worked.	考虑到金融危机让实体经济活动状况不甚明了，很难确定地评估这些措施效果的好坏。
But it is clear that there must be a better way to do things.	但显然这些措施不是最好的办法。
There is no longer any reason to let the zero bound on nominal interest rates continue to hamper monetary policy.	让名义利率为零的下限羁绊货币政策早已毫无道理。
A simple and elegant solution is to phase in a switchover to a fully electronic currency, where paying interest, positive or negative, requires only the push of a button.	一个简单又优美的解决方案是逐步向完全电子化的货币靠拢，使用电子货币后，支付利息（正或负）只要按个按钮就行了。
And with paper money – particularly large-denomination notes – arguably doing more harm than good, currency modernization is long overdue.	而若使用纸币 — — 特别是大面额钞票 — — 实际上弊大于利，货币现代化可谓姗姗来迟。
Using an electronic currency, central banks could continue to stabilize inflation exactly as they do now.	使用电子货币，央行能够如同现在所做的那样稳定通胀。
(Citigroup’s chief economist, Willem Buiter, has suggested numerous ways to address the constraint of paper currency, but eliminating it is the easiest.)	（花旗集团首席经济学家威廉·布伊特（Willem Buiter）给出了多种解决纸币造成的不便的方法，但取消纸币是最简单的。 ）
A second, less elegant idea is to have central banks simply raise their target inflation rates from today’s norm of 2% to a higher but still moderate level of 4%.	其次，还有一种不那么优美的办法，即让央行将目标通胀率从今天的标准水平2%提高到仍属温和水平的4 % 。
The idea of permanently raising inflation targets to 4% was first proposed in an interesting and insightful paper led by IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard, and has been endorsed by a number of other academics, including, most recently, Paul Krugman.	将通胀目标永久提高到4%的方案首先由IMF首席经济学家奥利佛·布兰查德（Olivier Blanchard）在一篇有趣又深邃的论文中提出，并获得了其他许多学者的支持，包括最近的保罗·克鲁格曼（Paul Krugman ） 。
Unfortunately, the problem of making a smooth and convincing transition to the new target is perhaps insurmountable.	不幸的是，实现平稳而有说服力地向新目标转变可能是无法实现的任务。
When Blanchard first proposed his idea, I was intrigued but skeptical.	布兰查德第一次提出他的方案是，我感到非���新鲜，但也有所怀疑。
Mind you, two years previously, at the outset of the financial crisis, I suggested raising inflation to 4% or more for a period of a few years to deflate the debt overhang and accelerate wage adjustment.	请注意，两年前金融危机爆发时，我建议在几年的时间里将通胀提高到4%以实现债务积压的再通胀并加速工资调整。
But there is a world of difference between temporarily raising inflation to address a crisis and unhinging long-term expectations.	但暂时提高通胀解决危机和改变长期预期是完全不同的两码事。
After two decades of telling the public that 2% inflation is Nirvana, central bankers would baffle people were they to announce that they had changed their minds – and not in some minor way, but completely.	二十年来，央行行长们一直告诉公众，2%的通胀是最佳状态，因此人们会产生困惑，难道他们在宣布他们改变主意了吗？ 并且主意还不是略有改变，而是全盘改变。
Just recall the market’s “taper tantrums” in May 2013, when then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke suggested a far more modest turn in monetary policy.	想想2013年5月，时任美联储主席伯南克表示货币政策将回到更温和的节奏，结果引起了市场的“收回之怒 ” （ taper tantrums ） 。
People might well ask why, if central bankers can change their long-term target from 2% to 4%, they could not later decide that it should be 5% or 6%?	人们会问，既然央行行长把长期目标从2%提高到4 % ， 那么难保他们又说应该提高到5%或6 % 。
Given the likelihood of a confused, mistrustful public, it is hard to find any deep rationale for a 4% target.	考虑到可能引起公众的迷惑和不信任，因此4%的通胀目标没有任何令人信服的理由。
At least the existing 2% inflation target stands for something, because central bankers can portray it as the moral equivalent of zero.	至少2%的通胀目标还有点道理可言，因为央行行长可以说它已经相当接近于零。
(Most experts believe that a true welfare-based price index would show significantly lower inflation than government inflation statistics indicate, because official data fail to capture the benefits of the constant flow of new goods into the economy.)	（大部分专家认为，真正的基于福利的价格指数所表现的通胀将大大低于政府通胀数据，因为官方数据不能体现新产品源源不断进入经济带来的好处。 ）
There is an analogy to the problems countries faced when they tried to re-establish the gold standard after World War I. Until the war, money was backed by gold and could be redeemed at a fixed rate.	这和各国在一战后试图重建金本位时面临的问题有些相似。 开战前，货币由黄金作支撑，并且兑换率可视为固定。
Though the system was highly vulnerable to bank runs and there was little scope for a monetary stabilization policy, people’s confidence in the system enabled it to anchor expectations.	尽管这一体系导致银行挤兑频发、货币稳定政策空间狭小，但人们对这一体系的信心使其能够锚定预期。
Unfortunately, the system completely collapsed after the war broke out in August 1914.	不幸的是，这一体系在1914年8月大战爆发后全盘崩溃了。
Revenue-desperate combatants were forced to turn to inflation finance.	急需收入的参战国被迫转向通胀金融。
They could not simultaneously debase the currency and back it with gold at a fixed rate.	它们无法同时实现货币贬值又维持其与黄金的固定兑换率。
After the war, as things settled down, governments tried to return to gold, partly as a symbol of a return to normalcy.	战后，随着秩序的恢复，政府试图回归黄金，部分也是因为要摆出回归常态的姿态。
But the revived inter-war gold standard ultimately fell apart, in no small part because it was impossible to rebuild public trust.	但两次大战间的金本位复辟最终还是崩溃了，很大程度上是因为无法重新建立公共信任。
A move by central banks to a long-term 4% inflation target risks triggering the same dynamic.	央行将长期通胀目标变为4%有可能导致同样的过程。
Fortunately, there is a much better way.	幸运的是，我们有比这好得多的办法。
Moving to an electronic government currency would not require a destabilizing change in the inflation target.	转向电子政府货币不需要通胀目标的破坏性变化。
Minor technical issues could easily be ironed out.	次要的技术问题也可以轻松解决。
For example, ordinary citizens could be allowed zero-interest-transactions balances (up to a limit).	比如，普通公民将被允许（一定程度的）零利息交易余额。
Presumably, nominal interest rates would move into negative territory only in response to a deep deflationary crisis.	理论上，名义利率只有在发生深度通缩危机时才会跌入负区间。
But when such a crisis does occur, central banks could power out of it far more quickly than is possible today.	但当这样的危机真的发生时，央行可以以比现在可行的快得多的速度采取强力手段解决危机。
And, as I have argued elsewhere, governments have long been penny-wise and pound-foolish to provide large-denomination notes, given that a large share are used in the underground economy and to finance illegal activities.	正如我在别处所指出的，长期以来，政府都在提供大面额钞票，这是拣了芝麻丢了西瓜，因为大面额钞票的大部分都用在了地下经济和非法活动上。
Moving to a twenty-first-century currency system would make it far simpler to move to a twenty-first-century central-banking regime as well.	转向二十一世纪货币体系可以让二十一世纪央行制度也变得更加可行。
	
Malthus, Marx, and Modern Growth	马尔萨斯、马克思和现代增长
CAMBRIDGE – The promise that each generation will be better off than the last is a fundamental tenet of modern society.	美国剑桥—每一代人都能过得比上一代人更好，这是现代社会的一个基本信条。
By and large, most advanced economies have fulfilled this promise, with living standards rising over recent generations, despite setbacks from wars and financial crises.	总的来说，大部分发达经济体都兑现了这一承诺，最近几代人的社会标准一直在提高，尽管战争和金融危机也会带来一些倒退。
In the developing world, too, the vast majority of people have started to experience sustained improvement in living standards and are rapidly developing similar growth expectations.	发展中国家亦然，大部分人民已开始享受持续的生活水平改善，类似的增长预期也在快速形成。
But will future generations, particularly in advanced economies, realize such expectations?	但子孙后代，特别是发达国家的子孙后代，能够实现这一预期吗？
Though the likely answer is yes, the downside risks seem higher than they did a few decades ago.	尽管可能的答案是肯定的，但下行风险比几十年前已经有所增加。
So far, every prediction in the modern era that mankind’s lot will worsen, from Thomas Malthus to Karl Marx, has turned out to be spectacularly wrong.	到目前为止，从马尔萨斯到马克思，凡是预测现代人的丰裕程度会下降的，最后都被证明错得离谱。
Technological progress has trumped obstacles to economic growth.	技术进步战胜了经济增长的障碍。
Periodic political rebalancing, sometimes peaceful, sometimes not, has ensured that the vast majority of people have benefited, albeit some far more than others.	周期性的权力再平衡 — — 有时是和平的，有时是不和平的 — — 确保了大部分人受益，尽管有些人的受益程度远高于其他人。
As a result, Malthus’s concerns about mass starvation have failed to materialize in any peaceful capitalist economy.	因此，马尔萨斯关于大面积饥荒的担忧在任何和平资本主义经济中都没有发生。
And, despite a disconcerting fall in labor’s share of income in recent decades, the long-run picture still defies Marx’s prediction that capitalism would prove immiserating for workers.	而尽管最近几十年中劳动力占��入的份额的下降令人担忧，但长期趋势仍否定了马克思关于资本主义将让工人万劫不复的预言。
Living standards around the world continue to rise.	全世界的生活水平都在持续上升。
But past growth performance is no guarantee that a broadly similar trajectory can be maintained throughout this century.	但过去的增长表现并不能保证本世纪都能够保持类似的大趋势。
Leaving aside potential geopolitical disruptions, there are some formidable challenges to overcome, mostly stemming from political underperformance and dysfunction.	抛开潜在地缘政治干扰不谈，仍有一些可怕的挑战有待克服，大部分都来自政治表现不力和功能失调。
The first set of issues includes slow-burn problems involving externalities, the leading example being environmental degradation.	第一类问题包括一些缓慢发酵的问题，如外部性，最显著的例子便是环境破坏。
When property rights are ill-defined, as in the case of air and water, government must step in to provide appropriate regulation.	在产权不够明晰时 — — 比如空气和水的产权 — — 政府必须站出来提供恰当的监管。
I do not envy future generations for having to address the possible ramifications of global warming and fresh-water depletion.	子孙后代或许不得不面对全球变暖和清洁水耗竭的难题。
A second set of problems concerns the need to ensure that the economic system is perceived as fundamentally fair, which is the key to its political sustainability.	第二类问题事关确保经济制度能给人民带来公平感，这是政治可持续性的关键。
This perception can no longer be taken for granted, as the interaction of technology and globalization has exacerbated income and wealth inequality within countries, even as cross-country gaps have narrowed.	公平感已不再是理所当然之事，技术和全球化扩大了国家内部的财富不平等，尽管国家间差距已有所缩小。
Until now, our societies have proved remarkably adept at adjusting to disruptive technologies; but the pace of change in recent decades has caused tremendous strains, reflected in huge income disparities within countries, with near-record gaps between the wealthiest and the rest.	到目前为止，我们的社会表现出极强的适应破坏性技术的能力，但近几十年来，变化之迅速带来巨大的紧张局面，体现在国家内部的巨大收入差距上，最富有人群和其他人的差距接近历史记录。
Inequality can corrupt and paralyze a country’s political system – and economic growth along with it.	不平等性可能侵蚀甚至崩坏一国的政治制度，经济增长也将随之东流。
The third problem is that of aging populations, an issue that would pose tough challenges even for the best-designed political system.	第三个问题是人口老化，即使是设计最合理的政治制度也将面临这一问题的严峻挑战。
How will resources be allocated to care for the elderly, especially in slow-growing economies where existing public pension schemes and old-age health plans are patently unsustainable?	如何配置资源以照顾老年人，特别是在现有公共养老金制度和老人医疗计划难以为继的低增长经济体？
Soaring public debts surely exacerbate the problem, because future generations are being asked both to service our debt and to pay for our retirements.	公共债务水平的暴增显然加剧了这一问题，因为子孙后代将不得不在为我们偿债的同时供养我们的退休生活。
The final challenge concerns a wide array of issues that require regulation of rapidly evolving technologies by governments that do not necessarily have the competence or resources to do so effectively.	最后一个挑战关系到一系列问题，这些问题需要政府对快速演进的技术进行监管，而政府并不一定具有进行有效监管的能力和资源。
We have already seen where poor regulation of rapidly evolving financial markets can lead.	我们已经看到，对快速演进的金融市场的拙劣监管导致了怎样的问题。
There are parallel shortcomings in many other markets.	在许多其他市场上也存在相同的不足。
A leading example is food supply – an area where technology has continually produced ever-more highly processed and genetically refined food that scientists are only beginning to assess.	一个显著的例子是食品供给。 在这一领域，科技在持续生产着日益复杂的转基因食品，而科学家对这些食品的评估才刚刚开始。
What is known so far is that childhood obesity has become an epidemic in many countries, with an alarming rise in rates of type 2 diabetes and coronary disease implying a significant negative impact on life expectancy in future generations.	如今，我们知道儿童肥胖已是很多国家的一个普遍问题，2型糖尿病和冠心病的高发也是一个令人警惕的信号，会对子孙后代的预期寿命带来巨大的消极影响。
Many leading health researchers, including Kelly Brownell, David Ludwig, and Walter Willett, have documented these problems.	许多尖端健康研究者，包括布朗尼尔（Kelly Brownell ） 、 路德维格（David Ludwig ） 、 维莱特（Walter Willett ） ， 都提出了这一问题。
Government interventions to date, mainly in the form of enhanced education, have proved largely ineffective.	目前政府干预往往以强化教育的形式出现，但收效甚微。
Self-destructive addiction to processed foods, which economists would describe as an “internality,” can lower quality of life for those afflicted, and can eventually lead to externalities for society, such as higher health-care costs.	自我毁灭的加工食品瘾 — — 经济学家称之为“内部性 ” — —会降低成瘾者的生活质量，并最终带来对社会的外部性，如更高的医疗成本。
Again, despite a rising chorus of concern from researchers, political markets have seemed frozen.	在这方面，尽管越来越多的研究者呼吁要引起关注，但政治市场仍是坚冰一块。
All of these problems have solutions, at least in the short to medium run.	所有这些问题都有解决办法，至少在短期和中期是如此。
A global carbon tax would mitigate climate risks while alleviating government debt burdens.	全球碳税能降低气候风险，同时减轻政府债务负担。
Addressing inequality requires greater redistribution through national tax systems, together with enhanced programs for adult education, presumably making heavy use of new technologies.	纠正不平等性需要通过国家税收体系进行更深程度的再分配，并辅之以充分利用高科技手段的强化成人教育。
The negative effects of falling population growth can be mitigated by easing restrictions on international migration, and by encouraging more women and retirees to enter or stay in the workforce.	人口增长下降的消极效应可以通过降低国际移民壁垒和鼓励更多女性和退休者进入或留在工作大军内来抑制。
But how long it will take for governments to act is a wide-open question.	但政府需要多长时间才能有所行动远未可知。
Capitalist economies have been spectacularly efficient at enabling growing consumption of private goods, at least over the long run.	资本主义经济在促进私人商品消费增长方面效率极高，至少在长期是如此。
When it comes to public goods – such as education, the environment, health care, and equal opportunity – the record is not quite as impressive, and the political obstacles to improvement have seemed to grow as capitalist economies have matured.	而对于公共商品 — — 如教育、环境、医疗和机会平等 — — 资本主义经济的记录便不那么令人瞩目了，而随着资本主义经济走向成熟，改善的政治障碍似乎也在提高。
Will each future generation continue to enjoy a better quality of life than its immediate predecessor?	每一代人还能继续比上一代人享受更高的生活质量吗？
In developing countries that have not yet reached the technological frontier, the answer is almost certainly yes.	在尚未抵达技术前沿的发展中国家，答案几乎必然是肯定的。
In advanced economies, though the answer should still be yes, the challenges are becoming formidable.	而在发达经济体，尽管答案应该仍然是肯定的，但挑战已经十分艰巨。
	
Europe’s Debt Wish	欧洲的债务愿望
CAMBRIDGE – Eurozone leaders continue to debate how best to reinvigorate economic growth, with French and Italian leaders now arguing that the eurozone’s rigid “fiscal compact” should be loosened.	美国剑桥—欧洲领导人仍在争论如何最好地为经济增长注入动力，法国和意大利领导人现在认为，欧元区死板的“财政契约”应该放松。
Meanwhile, the leaders of the eurozone’s northern member countries continue to push for more serious implementation of structural reform.	与此同时，欧元区北欧成员国领导人继续要求更严格地实施结构性改革。
Ideally, both sides will get their way, but it is difficult to see an endgame that does not involve significant debt restructuring or rescheduling.	在理想状况下，双方可以自行其是，但目前难以看到可以免于重大债务重组或期限重排的结局。
The inability of Europe’s politicians to contemplate this scenario is placing a huge burden on the European Central Bank.	欧洲政客不能想象这一情形，这给欧洲央行造成了非常沉重的负担。
Although there are many explanations for the eurozone’s lagging recovery, it is clear that the overhang of both public and private debt looms large.	尽管关于欧元区的复苏迟缓存在许多解释，但显然公共和私人债务积压是很重要的原因。
The gross debts of households and financial institutions are higher today as a share of national income than they were before the financial crisis.	如今，家庭和金融机构总债务占国民收入的比重比金融危机前还要高。
Nonfinancial corporate debt has fallen only slightly.	非金融企业债略有下降。
And government debt, of course, has risen sharply, owing to bank bailouts and a sharp, recession-fueled decline in tax revenues.	而政府债务当然出现了剧增，这是拜银行援助和衰退导致税收收入猛降所赐。
Yes, Europe is also wrestling with an aging population.	是的，欧洲还在与人口老龄化角力。
Southern eurozone countries such as Italy and Spain have suffered from rising competition with China in textiles and light manufacturing industries.	欧元区南部成员国（如意大利和西班牙）日益受到中国纺织和轻型制造业的竞争。
But just as the pre-crisis credit boom masked underlying structural problems, post-crisis credit constraints have greatly amplified the downturn.	但正如危机前信用繁荣掩盖了根本的结构性问题，危机后信用约束也大大加剧了衰退之势。
True, German growth owes much to the country’s willingness a decade ago to engage in painful economic reforms, especially of labor-market rules.	诚然，德国增长在很大程度上要归因于该国在十年前愿意采取痛苦的经济改革，特别是劳动力市场规则。
Today, Germany appears to have full employment and above-trend growth.	如今，德国正处于充分就业状态，增长也高于趋势水平。
German leaders believe, with some justification, that if France and Italy were to adopt similar reforms, the changes would work wonders for their economies’ long-term growth.	德国领导人相信 — — 有一定根据 — — 如果法国和意大利也采取类似的改革，它们的经济长期增长前景将迎来巨大的改观。
Yet what of Portugal, Ireland, and (especially) Spain, all of which have taken significant steps toward reform since the crisis?	但葡萄牙、爱尔兰和（特别是）西班牙呢？
All are still experiencing double-digit unemployment rates amid moribund growth, and, as the last International Monetary Fund Fiscal Monitor made abundantly clear, all still suffer from significant debt problems.	自危机以来，它们已经采取了不少重大改革步骤，但它们都仍在经历两位数的失业率和停滞不前的增长，并且，正如上一期国际货币基金组织《财政观察 》 （ Fiscal Monitor）所揭示的，它们都仍在为严重的债务问题焦头烂额。
Debt overhang traps countries in a vicious circle.	债务积压让国家陷入恶性循环。
Exceptionally high public and private debts constrain a country’s options and are indisputably associated with slower growth, which in turn makes it difficult to escape a debt trap.	过高的公共和私人债务约束了一国的选择，并且毫无例外地伴随着更低的增长，而更低的增长反过来又让国家难以摆脱债务陷阱。
Last spring’s campaign against anyone who dared to worry about the long-run effects of high debt largely ignored the substantial academic literature, just as a remarkably similar recent challenge to Thomas Piketty’s research on inequality took no account of a larger body of evidence.	去年春天针对所有敢于担忧高债务的长期影响者的批评大多对大量学术研究成果视而不见，与此形成惊人相似的是，眼下对托马斯·皮克提（Thomas Piketty）关于不平等性的研究的诘难也根本不顾大量证据。
It is true that not all debt is created equal, and there is a strong case for adding more of it if the purpose is to finance highly productive infrastructure investments.	诚然，并非所有债务都是以相同方式创造出来的，有强烈的理由认为，如果目的是为高生产率的基础设施投资，就应该增加债务。
Europe greatly lags many Asian countries in its efforts to expand the reach of broadband.	欧洲在拓展道路网络方面的措施远远落后于许多亚洲国家。
Outside the Nordic countries, electricity networks are thoroughly Balkanized, and major efforts are needed to integrate them.	除了北欧国家，电网几乎都是地方化的，要实现整合必须投入巨资。
Raising debt for the purposes of significantly increasing or ensuring long-run growth makes sense, especially in an environment of low real interest rates.	为了大幅提高或确保长期增长而正价债务是值得的，特别是在实际利率低下的环境中。
A similar argument can be made for expenditures aimed at improving education, for example to improve Europe’s underfunded universities.	类似的观点也适用于旨在改善教育（如资金短缺的欧洲的大学）的支出。
Beyond growth-enhancing investment, however, the case for greater stimulus becomes more nuanced.	但是，除了强化增长的投资，加强刺激的理由便不再强烈了。
Brad Delong and Larry Summers have argued that in a repressed economy, short-term increases in borrowing can pay for themselves, even if the expenditures do not directly increase long-run potential. By contrast, Alberto Alesina and Silvia Ardagna argue that in an economy with a large and inefficient government, debt-stabilization measures directed at reducing the size of government can actually be expansionary.	布拉德·德隆（Brad Delong ）和拉里·萨默斯（Larry Summers）指出，在存在庞大而低效的政府的经济中，以收缩政府规模为目标的稳定债务措施实际上可能产生扩张的效果。
I admit to being an outsider to this debate.	我得承认，我并没有加入过这场争论。
(The word “austerity” does not appear once in my 2009 book with Carmen Reinhart on the history of financial crises.)	（ “ 紧缩”一词在我和莱因哈特（Carmen Reinhart）2009年关于金融危机史的著作中一次也没有出现过。
My general sense, however, is that both views are extreme.	）但是，我的总体感觉是，两种观点都有走极端的嫌疑。
In general, neither pure austerity nor crude Keynesian stimulus can help countries escape high-debt traps.	整体而言，不管是单纯的紧缩，还是原始的凯恩斯主义刺激，都不能帮助一国摆脱高债务陷阱。
Throughout history, other measures, including debt rescheduling, inflation, and various forms of wealth taxation (such as financial repression), have typically played a significant role.	纵观历史，其他措施，包括债务期限重排、通胀和各种形式的财富税（如金融抑制 ） ， 通常都会起到显著作用。
It is hard to see how European countries can indefinitely avoid recourse to the full debt toolkit, especially to repair the fragile economies of the eurozone’s periphery.	很难想象欧洲国家能够永远避免债务工具全开，特别是在修复欧元区外围脆弱的经济时。
The ECB’s expansive “whatever it takes” guarantee may indeed be enough to help finance greater short-term stimulus than is currently being allowed; but the ECB’s guarantee will not solve long-run sustainability problems.	欧洲央行扩张性的“竭尽全力”担保确实可能足以为比目前所允许的更大规模短期刺激提供资金；但欧洲央行的担保无法解决长期可持续性问题。
Indeed, the ECB will soon have to confront the fact that structural reforms and fiscal austerity fall far short of being a complete solution to Europe’s debt problems.	事实上，欧洲央行很快就必须面对一个事实：结构性改革和财政紧缩远不足以成为解决欧洲债务问题的完整方案。
In October and November, the ECB will announce the results of its bank stress tests.	在10月和11月，欧洲央行将宣布其银行压力测试结果。
Because many banks hold a large volume of eurozone government debt, the results will depend very much on how the ECB assesses sovereign risk.	由于许多银行持有大量欧元区政府债务，其结果将在很大程度上取决于欧洲央行如何评估主权风险。
If the ECB grossly understates the risks, its credibility as a regulator will be badly tarnished.	如果欧洲央行只能大致上理解这些风险，其作为监管者的信誉将受到严重打击。
If it is more forthright about the risks, there is a chance that some periphery countries might have difficulty plugging the holes, and will require help from the north.	如果它能更深入地理解这些风险，那么一些外围国家有可能已难以自保，需要北欧的帮助。
One hopes that the ECB will be forthright.	我们希望欧洲央行的认识深刻一些。
It is high time for a conversation on debt relief for the entire eurozone periphery.	为整个欧元区外围展开债务纾困谈判刻不容缓。
	
How Fragile are Emerging Markets?	新兴市场有多脆弱？
CAMBRIDGE – Emerging-market equities and exchange rates are again under severe downward pressure, but are the underlying economies really as fragile as global traders seem to fear?	美国剑桥—新兴市场股票和汇率再议处于严重的压力之下，但基础经济真的如全球交易者担忧的那样脆弱吗？
The short answer, for a few, is probably “yes,” but for most, “not just yet.”	简单的回答，对一部分人可能是“是 ” ， 但对大部分人是“尚未 ” 。
For most countries, what we are seeing is a recalibration as investors incorporate the risk that China’s GDP might rise more slowly, the US Federal Reserve might start tightening monetary conditions more quickly, and policy backsliding in many countries might undermine potential growth.	对大部分国家，我们看到的是重估 — — 投资者开始考虑中国GDP增长可能进一步放缓、美联储可能开始更快地收紧货币政策、许多国家的政策倒退可能威胁潜在增长。
At the same time, Europe’s massive shift to a trade surplus (a key factor underpinning the region’s new-found stability) and the Japanese yen’s sharp depreciation are among myriad factors squeezing countries seeking to rein in current-account deficits.	与此同时，欧洲大规模转向贸易盈余（该地区新近出现的稳定之势的关键原因）和日元的大幅贬值以及其他众多原因让寻求解决经常项目赤字问题的国家十分被动。
It seems like only yesterday that Goldman Sachs analysts were celebrating the growth miracle of the “BRICS” (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) and the International Monetary Fund, in its April 2013 World Economic Outlook, was forecasting a three-speed global recovery led by emerging markets.	高盛分析师大唱“金砖国家 ” （ 巴西、俄罗斯、印度、中国和南非）增长奇迹的赞歌和国际货币基金组织（IMF）在其《2013年世界经济展望》预测新兴市场将领导三速全球复苏彷佛就在昨天。
What happened?	发生了什么事？
The most popular culprit is the Fed, which has begun to taper its highly experimental policy of “quantitative easing,” or purchases of long-term assets aimed at supporting growth beyond what could be achieved with zero nominal interest rates.	最受千夫所指的是美联储，它开始收紧其具有高度实验性的“量化宽松”政策，即购买长期资产以支持零��义利率条件下的进一步增长。
But the Fed’s role is almost certainly overblown.	但美联储的作用几乎可以肯定被高估了。
For one thing, the Fed’s retreat partly reflects growing confidence in the US economy, which should mean a stronger export market for most emerging economies.	一方面，美联储的退出政策部分反映了美国经济信心的增加，而这应该给大部分新兴经济体带来更强劲的出口。
Moreover, the Fed’s modest tightening is being matched by a trend toward looser monetary policy in the eurozone and Japan; so, overall, advanced-country monetary policy remains highly accommodative.	此外，在美联储采取温和的紧缩的同时，欧元区和日本的货币政策呈现宽松之势；因此，总体而言发达国家货币政策仍是相当有利的。
Uncertainty over China’s growth path is more fundamental.	对中国增长路径的担忧更加根本。
For more than a decade, China’s stunning growth has fueled a remarkable price boom that has flattered policymakers in commodity-exporting emerging markets from Russia to Argentina.	十多年来，中国卓越的增长助长了令人瞩目的价格繁荣，这让从俄罗斯到阿根廷的各个商品出口新兴经济体的决策者踌躇满志。
Remember how the Argentines were able to thumb their noses at the pro-market “Washington Consensus” in favor of an interventionist “Buenos Aires consensus”?	还记得阿根廷是如何对支持市场的“华盛顿共识”嗤之以鼻、并支持干预主义的“布宜诺斯艾利斯共识”的吗？
Now, not so much.	现在，一切都变了。
China’s near-term growth is an open question, as its new leadership attempts to curb the unsustainable credit-fueled boom.	中国短期增长结果前景不明，因为其新领导层试图抑制不可持续的信用推动的繁荣。
Until recently, global markets had not seemed to recognize that a growth recession was even a possibility.	直到最近，全球市场都并不认为会发生增长衰退。
Certainly, if there ever is a pause in China’s heady growth, today’s emerging-market turmoil will seem like a mere hiccup compared to the earthquake that will ensue.	显然，如果中国强劲的增长迎来一次暂停，将会造成新兴市场的地震，与之相比，今天新兴市场的波动只不过是打了个嗝。
There are other notable, if less consequential, fundamentals in the mix.	还有其他重要（如果因果关系较弱的话）的基本因素。
The shale-gas revolution in the US is changing the global energy equation.	美国的页岩气革命正在改变全球能源格局。
Energy exporters such as Russia are feeling the downward pressure on export prices.	俄罗斯等能源出口国正在感到出口价格下降的压力。
At the same time, hyper-low-cost energy in the US is affecting Asian manufacturers’ competitiveness, at least for some products.	与此同时，美国超低的能源成本正在影响亚洲制造业的竞争力，至少对某些产品是如此。
And, as Mexico reforms its energy sector, the range of pressures on Asian manufacturing will expand; Mexico is already benefitting from cost pressures in China.	此外，墨西哥开始了其能源部门改革，亚洲制造业的压力还会扩大；墨西哥已经从中国的成本压力中获得了好处。
Japan’s Abenomics is also important for some countries, as the sharp depreciation in the value of the yen puts pressure on Korea in particular and on Japan’s Asian competitors in general.	日本的安倍经济学对一些国家来说也很重要，因为日元的急剧贬值给日本的亚洲竞争对手造成了压力，特别是韩国。
In the long run, a Japanese resurgence would, of course, be beneficial to the region’s economies.	当然，在长期，日本的重新崛起是有益于地区经济的。
Stability in the eurozone has been perhaps the single most important positive factor underpinning market confidence in the last year.	欧元区的稳定也许是去年支撑市场信心的唯一最重要的积极因素。
But, as periphery countries move into current-account balance and northern countries such as Germany run massive surpluses, the flip side has been deterioration in emerging-market surpluses, heightening their vulnerabilities.	但是，随着外围国转向经常项目平衡、德国等北欧国家存在大量盈余，新兴市场盈余将遭受冲击，增加它们的脆弱度。
At the core of emerging-market problems, however, is policy and political backsliding.	但是，新兴经济体问题的核心是政策和政治倒退。
Here, there are significant differences among countries.	在这方面，不同国家存在很大的不同。
In Brazil, the government’s efforts to weaken the central bank’s independence and meddle in energy and lending markets have harmed growth.	在巴西，政府削弱央行独立性和干涉能源和借贷市场的举动已经对增长造成了伤害。
Turkey is suffering acute challenges to its democratic institutions, as well as government pressure on the central bank.	土耳其因为民主制度以及政府对央行的压力而遭受了严峻挑战。
Russia’s failure to develop strong independent institutions has made it difficult for an entrepreneurial class to emerge and help diversify the economy.	俄罗斯没有发展出强大的独立机构让它的创业家阶层难以崛起并促进经济的多样化。
In India, central-bank independence remains reasonably strong, with the Reserve Bank of India now mulling a move to an inflation-targeting regime.	在印度，央行独立性仍非常坚挺，印度储备银行正在考虑通胀目标机制。
But a sustained period of populist policies has weakened trend growth and exacerbated inflation.	但持续的民粹主义政策削弱了趋势增长率，也加剧了通胀。
Nevertheless, some emerging markets are moving forward and stand to benefit from the turmoil if they are able to stay the course.	尽管如此，一些新兴市场仍在进步，如果保持势头将能够从动荡中获益。
Aside from Mexico, countries such as Chile, Colombia, and Peru are well positioned to gain from investments in institution-building.	除了墨西哥，智利、哥伦比亚和秘鲁等国家也很有希望从制度建设投资中获得好处。
But, of course, new institutions can take decades, and sometimes longer, to consolidate.	但是，毫无疑问，新制度需要几十年甚至更长时间才能得到巩固。
So, overall, how fragile are emerging markets?	那么，总体而言新兴市场有多脆弱？
Unlike in the 1990’s, when fixed exchange rates were widespread, most countries now have shock-absorbing flexible rates.	与通行固定利率的20世纪90年代不同，如今大部分国家都实施了能吸收冲击的弹性汇率。
Indeed, today’s drama can be interpreted, in part, as a reflection of these shock absorbers at work.	事实上，今天的情景从一定程度上可以看成这些冲击吸收器在工作的反映。
Emerging-market equities may have plummeted, but this, too, is a shock absorber.	新兴市场股票在下跌，但这也是冲击吸收器。
The real question is what will happen when the turmoil moves to debt markets.	真正的问题是当动荡蔓延到债务市场时会发生什么。
Many countries have built up substantial reserves, and are now issuing far more debt in domestic currency.	许多国家建立了庞大的储备，并且绝大部分债务用本币计价。
Of course, the option of inflating away debt is hardly a panacea.	当然，用通胀来解决债务绝不是灵丹妙药。
Unfortunately, there is surely more drama to come over the next few years.	不幸的是，未来几年必然还会发生很多戏剧性的场景。
	
Why Wealth Taxes Are Not Enough	为什么光有财富税是不够的
CAMBRIDGE – Should advanced countries implement wealth taxes as a means of stabilizing and reducing public debt over the medium term?	美国剑桥—发达国家应该实施财富税以作为中期稳定和减少公共债务的手段吗？
The normally conservative International Monetary Fund has given the idea surprisingly emphatic support.	通常较为保守的国际货币基金组织（IMF）出人意料地非常支持这一看法。
The IMF calculates that a one-time 10% wealth levy, if introduced quickly and unexpectedly, could return many European countries to pre-crisis public debt/GDP ratios.	据IMF计算，快速而出乎意料地一次性征收10%的财富税可以让许多欧洲国家的债务/GDP比率回到危机前水平。
It is an intriguing idea.	这是一个颇有吸引力的想法。
The moral case for a wealth tax is more compelling than usual today, with unemployment still at recession levels, and with deep economic inequality straining social norms.	财富税的道德问题在今天比以往更具紧迫性，因为如今的失业率仍处在衰退水平，而深刻的经济不平等正在挑战社会规范。
And, if it were really possible to ensure that the wealth levy would be temporary, such a tax would, in principle, be much less distortionary than imposing higher marginal tax rates on income.	此外，如果真能确保财富税为临时性税种，那么从原理上说，该税比提高边际所得税率所造成的扭曲作用更小。
Unfortunately, while a wealth tax may be a sound way to help a country dig out of a deep fiscal pit, it is hardly a panacea.	不幸的是，尽管财富税可能是帮助一国走出财政泥淖的可靠方法，却难以成为万灵丹。
For starters, the revenue gains from temporary wealth taxes can be very elusive.	首先，来自临时性财富税的收入可能难以计算。
The economist Barry Eichengreen once explored the imposition of capital levies in the aftermath of World Wars I and II.	经济学家巴里·艾肯格林（Barry Eichengreen）曾探索过两次世界大战后资本税的构成。
He found that, owing to capital flight and political pressure for delay, the results were often disappointing.	他发现，由于资本外逃和推迟执行的政治压力，结果通常令人失望。
Italy’s armada of Guardia di Finanza boats would hardly forestall a massive exodus of wealth if Italians see a sizable wealth tax coming.	如果意大利将实施大规模财富税政策，则该国海关很难阻止大规模财富外流。
Over- and under-invoicing of trade, for example, is a time-tested way to spirit money out of a country.	比如，高报和低报贸易是经历了时间考验的将资金抽离一国的良方。
(For example, an exporter under-reports the price received for a foreign shipment, and keeps the extra cash hidden abroad.)	（比如，出口商低报从对外出口获得的价格，将多出来的现金藏在国外。
And there would be a rush into jewelry and other hard-to-detect real assets.	）还有大笔资金将涌入珠宝和其他难以侦测的实体资产。
The distortionary effects of a wealth levy would also be exacerbated by concerns that the “temporary” levy would not be a one-off tax.	财富税的扭曲效应还会因为担心“临时性”税收并非一次性而被放大。
After all, most temporary taxes come for lunch and stay for dinner.	毕竟，大部分临时性税收最后都演变成永久性。
Fears of future wealth taxes could discourage entrepreneurship and lower the saving rate.	对未来财富税的担心可能会阻碍企业家精神、降低储蓄率。
In addition, the administrative difficulties of instituting a comprehensive wealth tax are formidable, raising questions about fairness.	此外，制定全面财富税的行政难处极大，会造成关于公平的质疑。
For example, it would be extremely difficult to place market values on the family-owned businesses that pervade Mediterranean countries.	比如，用市场价值衡量家族企业（在地中海国家颇为常见）是非常困难的。
Wealth taxes that target land and structures are arguably insulated from some of these concerns, and property taxes are relatively underused outside the Anglo-Saxon countries.	针对土地和建筑的财富税基本与这些担心无关，物业税在盎格鲁-撒���逊国家以外的地区也相对少见。
In theory, taxing immobile assets is less distortionary, though taxes on structures obviously can discourage both maintenance and new construction.	理论上，对不动产课税的扭曲效应较低，严厉的建筑税显然不利于建筑的新建和维护。
So what else can eurozone governments do to raise revenue as their economies recover?	那么，随着经济的复苏，欧元区政府还可以从哪里增加收入？
Most economists favor finding ways to broaden the tax base – for example, by eliminating special deductions and privileges – in order to keep marginal tax rates low.	大部分经济学家倾向于扩大税基 — — 比如，取消特殊扣减项和特权 — — 从而保持边际税率的低水平。
Broadening the income-tax base is a central element of the highly regarded Simpson/Bowles proposals for tax reform in the United States.	扩大所得税基是获得盛赞的美国辛普森/鲍尔斯（Simpson/Bowles）税收改革方案的核心要素。
In Europe, efficiency would be enhanced by a unified VAT rate, instead of creating distortions by charging different rates for different goods.	在欧洲，可以用统一的增值税率来增进效率，而不应该通过对不同商品课以不同税率制造扭曲。
In principle, low-income individuals and families could be compensated through lump-sum transfer programs.	理论上，低收入个人和家庭应该通过一次性转移支付计划补偿。
Another idea is to try to raise more revenue from carbon permits or taxes.	另一个思路是试图从碳排许可和碳排税中增加收入。
Raising funds by taxing negative externalities reduces distortions rather than creating them.	通过对负外部性课税筹资能减少而不会创造扭曲。
Though such taxes are spectacularly unpopular – perhaps because individuals refuse to admit that the externalities they themselves create are significant – I regard them as an important direction for future policy (and I intend to suggest other ideas along these lines in future columns).	尽管这些税非常不受欢迎 — — 也许是因为个人拒绝承认他们所造成的外部性十分巨大 — — 但我认为这是未来政策的重要方向（我还会在后续专栏中继续介绍这一方向的其他思路 ） 。
Unfortunately, advanced countries have implemented very little fundamental tax reform so far.	不幸的是，目前发达国家几乎没有实施根本性的税收改革。
Many governments are giving in to higher marginal tax rates rather than overhauling and simplifying the system.	许多政府提高了边际税率，而没有修正和简化税制。
In Europe, officials are also turning to stealth taxes, particularly financial repression, to resolve high public-debt overhangs.	在欧洲，官员还打起了用隐性税（特别是金融抑制）解决公共债务大量积压的问题。
Through regulation and administrative directives, banks, insurance companies, and pension funds are being forced to hold much higher shares of government debt than they might voluntarily choose to do.	通过监管和行政指导，银行、保险公司和退基金进被迫大量增加政府债务的持有比例，远远高出自愿选择情形时的水平。
But this approach is hardly progressive, as the final holders of pensions, insurance contracts, and bank deposits are typically the beleaguered middle class and the elderly.	但这一方法很难具有累进性，因为退休基金、保险合同和银行存款的最终持有者通常是处处受压迫的中产阶级和老年人。
There is also the unresolved question of how much the periphery countries really should be asked to pay on their debilitating debt burdens, whatever the tax instrument.	还有一个未解决的问题：不管使用什么税收工具，外围国在应该被要求偿付多少令其不堪重负的债务。
Although the IMF seems particularly enthusiastic about using wealth taxes to resolve debt overhangs in Spain and Italy, some burden sharing with the north seems reasonable.	尽管IMF似乎十分热衷于用财富税解决西班牙和意大利的债务积压，但北方更多地承担债务共担似乎也是合理的。
As the economists Maurice Obstfeld and Galina Hale recently noted, German and French banks earned large profits intermediating flows between Asian savers and Europe’s periphery.	经济学家毛里斯·奥布斯菲尔德（Maurice Obstfeld）和加里纳·赫尔（Galina Hale）最近指出，德国和法国银行在为亚洲储蓄者和欧洲外围国家充当中介的业务中赚取了大量利润。
Unfortunately, arguing over burden sharing creates more scope for delay, potentially undermining the efficacy of any wealth tax that might finally be instituted.	不幸的是，争论债务共担问题给拖延造成了更大的空间，这可能破坏最终可能实施的财富税的效力。
Still, the IMF is right – on grounds of both fairness and efficiency – to raise the idea of temporary wealth taxes in advanced countries to relieve fiscal distress.	尽管如此，IMF提出在发达国家实施临时性财富税来纾解财政困境的思路是对的 — — 不管从公平还是从效率角度。
However, the revenues will almost certainly be lower, and the costs higher, than calculations used to promote them would imply.	但是，与用来促使财富税实施的推算相比，财富税的收入几乎肯定要更低，成本几乎肯定要更高。
Temporary wealth taxes may well be a part of the answer for countries in fiscal trouble today, and the idea should be taken seriously.	临时性财富税也许最好作为现今陷入财政困境的国家的解决方案的一部分，并且这一思路应该得到认真对待。
But they are no substitute for fundamental long-term reform to make tax systems simpler, fairer, and more efficient.	但它们绝不是让税制更简单、更公平和更高效的根本性长期改革的替代品。
	
Where Is the Inequality Problem?	不平等问题在哪里？
CAMBRIDGE – Reading Thomas Piketty’s influential new book Capital in the Twenty-First Century, one might conclude that the world has not been this unequal since the days of robber barons and kings.	美国剑桥—阅读托马斯·皮克提（Thomas Piketty）风靡一时的新书《二十一世纪资本论 》 （ Capital in the Twenty-First Century）会让你有这样一种感觉：自从强盗贵族和国王时代以来，世界从未如此不平等。
That is odd, because one might conclude from reading another excellent new book, Angus Deaton’s The Great Escape (which I recently reviewed), that the world is more equal than ever.	这有些奇怪，因为阅读另一部出色的新书、安格斯·迪顿（Angus Deaton）的《大脱贫 》 （ The Great Escape，我最近为它写了书评）会让你觉得世界比从前任何时候都更加平等。
Which view is right?	哪种观点才是正确的？
The answer depends on whether one looks only at countries individually or at the world as a whole.	答案取决于你看的是以各个国家的视角还是以世界整体视角看待这一问题。
The overarching fact in Deaton’s book is that over the last few decades, several billion people in the developing world, particularly in Asia, have escaped truly desperate levels of poverty.	迪顿的书所提出的最重要的事实是，最近几十年中，生活在发展中世界的数十亿人（特别是在亚洲 ） ， 名符其实地逃脱了令人绝望的贫困。
The same machine that has increased inequality in rich countries has leveled the playing field globally for billions.	在发达国家造成不平等加剧的同一套机制为全球数十亿人创造了公平竞技场。
Looking from afar, and giving, say, an Indian the same weight as an American or a Frenchman, the last 30 years have been among the greatest in human history for improving the lot of the poor.	拉远视角并赋予（比如）硬度名字和美国或法国名字同样的权重你会发现，过去三十年是人类历史上穷人改善最大的时期。
Piketty’s brilliant book documents within-country inequality, with the main focus being on the rich world.	皮克提的畅销新书讨论了国家内的不平等问题，主要关注发达世界。
Much of the cultural groundswell surrounding his book has come from people who view themselves as middle class within their own countries, but who are upper middle class or even rich by global standards.	这本书所造成的巨大争议主要存在于自视为所在国中产阶级、但从全球标准看属于中上甚至富裕阶级的人中间。
There are various arcane technical debates surrounding the facts that Piketty has established over the past 15 years with his co-author Emmanuel Saez.	皮克提和他的合作者阿玛努尔·萨茨（Emmanuel Saez）所描述的过去15年中的事实包含了晦涩难懂的学术争论。
But I find their results persuasive, especially given that other authors, using completely different methods, have reached similar conclusions.	但我认为结论是有说服力的，尤其是考虑到其他作者使用完全不同的方法也获得了类似的结论。
Brent Neiman and Loukas Karabarbounis of the University of Chicago, for example, argue that labor’s share of GDP has been declining globally since the 1970’s.	比如，芝加哥大学的布伦特·尼曼（Brent Neiman）和洛卡斯·卡拉巴波尼斯（Loukas Karabarbounis）指出，全球劳动力占GDP比重自20世纪70年代以来一直在下降。
However, Piketty and Saez do not really offer a model; nor does this new book.	但是，皮克提和萨茨实际上并未提出模型；他们的新书亦然。
And the lack of a model, combined with a focus on the world’s upper-middle-class countries, matters a lot when it comes to policy prescriptions.	而缺少模型加上内容主要关注世界中上阶层国家导致他们的政策药方有很大问题。
Would Piketty’s followers be nearly as enthusiastic about his proposed progressive global wealth tax if it were aimed at correcting the huge disparities between the richest countries and the poorest, instead of between those who are well off by global standards and the ultra-wealthy?	如果皮克提所提出的累进全球财富税的目的是减少最富裕国家和最贫穷国家之间的巨大差距，而不是减少按全球标准看属于富裕阶层者语最富有者之间的差距，他的追随者还会如热情吗？
Piketty argues that capitalism is unfair.	皮克提认为资本主义是不正义的。
Wasn’t colonialism unfair, too?	殖民主义不也是不正义的吗？
In any event, the idea of a global wealth tax is replete with credibility and enforcement problems, aside from being politically implausible.	无论如何，全球财富税的构想存在巨大的信誉和实施问题，更不用说在政治上不讨好了。
Though Piketty is right that returns to capital have increased in the last few decades, he is too dismissive of the wide-ranging debate among economists concerning the causes.	皮克提说，过去几十年来资本回报有所上升，这是对的，但他对关心这一现象原因的经济学家之间的广泛争论所知太少。
For example, if the main driver is the massive influx of Asian labor into globalized trade markets, the growth model put forth by the Nobel laureate economist Robert Solow suggests that eventually capital stocks will adjust and the wage rate will rise.	比如，如果这一现象的主要原因是亚洲劳动力大量涌入全球贸易市场，那么诺贝尔奖获得者罗伯特·索洛（Robert Solow）所提出的的增长模型表明，最终资本存量会出现调整，工资率会出现上升。
Retirements from an aging labor force will eventually drive up wages as well.	老龄化劳动力大军的退休也会最终推高工资。
If, on the other hand, labor’s share of income is falling because of the inexorable rise of automation, downward pressures on that share will continue, as I discussed in the context of artificial intelligence a few years ago.	另一方面，如果劳动力占收入比重下降的原因是自动化程度的不断提高，那么这一比例的下降压力将会继续，几年前，我以人工智能为背景讨论过这一问题。
Fortunately, there are much better ways to address rich-country inequality while still fostering long-term growth in demand for products from developing countries.	幸运的是，有更好的办法纠正发达国家的不平等问题，同时提振对发展中国家产品的长期需求增长。
For example, a shift to a relatively flat consumption tax (with a large deductible for progressivity) would be a far simpler and more effective way to tax past wealth accumulation, especially if citizens’ tax home can be linked to the locale where their income was earned.	比如，相对扁平的消费税（在累进性之上增加大量减扣项）是远为更简单、更有效的过去财富积累税，特别是在公民的报税地可以与他们的收入来源地挂钩时。
A progressive consumption tax is relatively efficient and does not distort savings decisions as much as today’s income taxes do.	累进的消费税相对高效，造成的储蓄决策扭曲也比现在的所得税小。
Why try to move to an improbable global wealth tax when alternatives are available that are growth friendly, raise significant revenue, and can be made progressive through a very high exemption.	既然有可行的增长友好型替代方案，能够带来重大收入提高并且可以通过极高的税收豁免实现累进性，为何还要采取不可行的全球财富税？
In addition to a global wealth tax, Piketty recommends an 80% marginal tax rate on income for the United States.	除了全球财富税，皮克提还建议美国实施80%的边际所得税率。
Though I strongly believe that the US needs more progressive taxation, particularly of the top 0.1%, I don’t understand why he assumes that an 80% rate would not cause significant distortions, especially as this assumption contradicts a large body of work by the Nobel laureates Thomas Sargent and Edward Prescott.	尽管我强烈认为美国需要更累进的税制，特别是对顶层的0.1%人群，但我不明白为何他认为80%的税率不会造成重大扭曲，特别是考虑到这一假设与诺贝尔奖获得者托马斯·萨金特（Thomas Sargent）和爱德华·普雷斯科特（Edward Prescott）的大部分工作相悖。
There are many practical policies that can be adopted to reduce inequality, in addition to a progressive consumption tax.	除了累进消费税，还有很多实际的政策可以用来减少不平等性。
Focusing on the US, Jeffrey Frankel of Harvard University has suggested the elimination of payroll taxes for low-income workers, a cut in deductions for high-income workers, and higher inheritance taxes.	以美国为例，哈佛大学的杰弗里·弗兰克尔（Jeffrey Frankel）提出豁免低收入工人的工资税，并削减高收入工人的扣减项、提高遗产税。
Universal pre-school education would enhance long-term growth, as would a much greater emphasis on lifetime adult education (my addition), possibly via online courses.	全民学前教育能够提振长期增长，大幅增强终身成人教育（可通过在线课程实现）亦然（这是我所做的引申 ） 。
Carbon taxes would help mitigate global warming while raising considerable revenues.	碳税将有助于在减轻全球变暖的同时大幅提高税收收入。
In accepting Piketty’s premise that inequality matters more than growth, one needs to remember that many developing-country citizens rely on rich-country growth to help them escape poverty.	如果你接受了皮克提关于不平等性比增长更重要的前提，你最好回忆一下，许多发展中国家人民依赖发达国家增长帮助他们摆脱贫困。
The first problem of the twenty-first century remains to help the dire poor in Africa and elsewhere.	二十一世纪的首要问题仍是帮助极端贫困的非洲和其他国家。
By all means, the elite 0.1% should pay much more in taxes, but let us not forget that when it comes to reducing global inequality, the capitalist system has had an impressive three decades.	无论如何，0.1%的精英都应该付出多得多的税收，但不要忘了，对降低全球不平等这一问题，资本主义制度在过去三十年中表现十分出色。
	
Foreign-Aid Follies	愚蠢的援助
MUMBAI – The huge gap between the world’s richest and poorest countries remains one of the great moral dilemmas for the West. It also presents one of the greatest challenges for development economics.	发自孟买 — — 世界上那些最富有和最贫穷国家之间的巨大鸿沟一直是西方遭遇的道德困境之一，也一直是发达国家所面临的其中一项最大挑战。
Do we really know how to help countries overcome poverty?	那么我们究竟知不知道如何才能帮助那些国家摆脱贫困？
In his eloquently written and deeply researched new book The Great Escape: Health, Wealth, and the Origins of Inequality, Princeton University’s Angus Deaton urges caution.	对此普林斯顿大学的安格斯·迪顿教授在他精心研究撰写的新书《大逃亡：健康，财富，以及不平等的本原》中提出了警告。
For those interested in world poverty, it is unquestionably the most important book on development assistance to appear in a long time.	对那些关注世界贫困的人来说，此书无疑是长期来研究发展援助的最重要著作。
Deaton suggests that far too often, Western aid serves to assuage donors’ guilt rather than improve recipients’ plight.	迪顿指出，在很大程度上西方援助都不是要改善受助者的境况，而是为了缓解捐助者的愧疚感。
This is particularly the case when naïve assistance serves to reinforce a dysfunctional status quo.	这在一些草率的援助反而导致糟糕现状不断固化的案例中显得尤为明显。
Although Deaton supports select initiatives, particularly for delivering medical and technological knowledge, he questions whether the vast majority of aid passes the basic Hippocratic litmus test of “first do no harm.”	虽然迪顿支持某些特定的举措 — — 尤其是输送药物和科学知识 — — 但他也质疑大多数援助是否通过了希波克拉底誓言的检验 ： “ 首先，不要伤害病人 。 ”
For starters, assessing and implementing aid policy requires developing tools to gauge accurately where need is greatest.	首先，获取和实施援助政策要求使用某些工具去准确判定哪些地方最需要帮助。
Economists have developed some useful indicators, but they are vastly less precise than politicians and the media seem to understand.	对此经济学家创立了一些有用的指数，但这些指数的准确度却远不如政治家和媒体以为的那样精确。
Most experts agree, and Deaton concurs, that at least a billion people on the planet live in desperate circumstances resembling conditions that prevailed hundreds of years ago.	大多数专家认定而迪顿也赞成的是，地球上至少有十亿人生活在跟前几个世纪类似的悲惨境地之中。
Our failure to alleviate their plight is morally reprehensible.	我们在缓解这些苦难方面的无能是应当受到道德谴责的。
But where, exactly, are the greatest concentrations of poor people?	但究竟穷人最集中的地方在哪里？
Data are hard to come by and even harder to interpret.	这样的数据非常难以搜集，甚至更难去解读？
Attempts to convert national incomes into a common denominator are fraught with complications.	尝试将国民收入转化为一个普遍标准的做法是充满复杂性的。
To take one prominent example, there is a 25% margin of error on purchasing-power-parity comparisons between GDP in the United States and China.	举一个著名的例子，美国和中国的GDP购买力平价对比之间存在着25%的误差幅度。
In other words, we cannot say whether Chinese output today equals 55% of US GDP or 92%.	换言之，我们无法确定当前的中国生产总值究竟是相当于美国GDP的55%还是92 % 。
So much for precise forecasts of the date when China will overtake the US as the world’s largest economy; we won’t even know for sure when it happens!	同样我们也无法精确预测中国究竟在何时超越美国成为世界第一大经济体；我们根本就不知道这事什么时候才会发生！
This problem is hardly unique to comparisons of China and the US; it applies with perhaps even greater force when comparing incomes of the poor in Mumbai with those of the poor in Freetown.	而这个问题可不仅存在于中美对比之中；甚至在比��印度孟买和塞拉里昂弗里敦两地的贫民收入时差距更大。
Another major problem is measuring progress in a given country over time.	另一个主要问题是如何测量某特定国家随时间不断发展进步的程度。
How can one compare cost-of-living indices in different periods when new goods are constantly upending traditional consumption models?	在新商品不断颠覆传统消费模式的情况下，你该如何比较不同时期的生活成本指数？
Consider the impact of cell phones in Africa, for example, or the Internet in India.	试想手机对非洲的影响，或是互联网对印度的冲击。
Deaton goes on to offer a revealing critique of some of the most hyped and fashionable approaches to improving aid.	迪顿接着对目前最受追捧的流行改善援助手段提出了启发性的批评。
For example, the “hydraulic model” of aid – the idea that if we simply pumped in more aid, better results would gush out – ignores the fact that funds are often fungible.	比如说，援助的“液压模式 ” — —所谓只要简单直接地提供更多援助，就能挤压出更好的结果 — — 却忽略了援助往往是可替换的事实。
Even if aid is narrowly targeted at say, food or health, a government can simply economize on expenditures that it might have made anyway and redirect them elsewhere – for example, to the military.	即便援助仅限于食品或者是医疗药品，受援地政府也可以直接节省下援助所产生的开支并将其转移到其他地方 — — 比如军事用途。
Direct delivery of medical help is one of the best options, but it still can be a huge drain on already-scarce local resources – hospitals, doctors, and nurses.	直接医疗援助是最好的选择之一，但它也可能吞咽掉本已稀缺的当地资源 — — 医院，医生和护士。
An influx of Western NGOs often bids talent away from nascent businesses that could help the country long after the NGOs reset their priorities and move on.	每当大量非政府组织涌入，它们通常会从当地新生的医疗机构中招募人才，一旦这些组织完成任务撤离，就只留下残缺不全的机构长期服务这个国家。
Indeed, there is a striking parallel between the problems caused by aid inflows and the “natural resource curse” (or “Dutch disease” as it is termed in Western countries), whereby inflows into one economic sector – typically oil or minerals – drive up economy-wide prices (including the exchange rate), rendering other sectors uncompetitive.	事实上，援助流入所导致的问题与“自然资源诅咒 ” （ 或是西方国家所说的“荷兰病 ” ） 之间存在着惊人的相似之处 — — 援助流入某些经济部门（一般是石油或者矿业）导致了整个经济体内部的价格（包括汇率）上升，令到其他经济部门丧失竞争力。
Moreover, a great deal of this aid is delivered in kind and for strategic reasons, often supporting ineffective and kleptocratic governments.	此外，许多这类援助都是用实物支付并出于战略原因，常常被用来支持效率低下的权贵政府。
Deaton observes that, in general, Western countries developed without receiving any aid. (Perhaps America’s post-World War II Marshall Plan in Europe is an exception, but that aid was intended more for reconstruction than for development.)	迪顿观察到，总体才说西方国家都是在毫无援助的情况下发展起来的（或许二战后美国支援欧洲的马歇尔计划是个例外，但该计划更加集中于重建而非发展 ） 。
China and India, too, have succeeded in lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty with relatively little Western aid (particularly China).	中国和印度的成功同样也是在较少西方援助下让数亿人摆脱贫困而取得的。
Deaton argues that aid providers must be extremely careful not to interfere with political and social forces that, over time, can generate organic – and therefore more lasting – internal change.	迪顿指出援助者必须极端谨慎，不要干涉那些随时间推移会引发有机 — — 并因此催生更持续内部变革 — — 的政治和社会力量。
Another intellectually fashionable approach is to conduct small randomized trials to examine, say, the effectiveness of school-attendance incentives or immunization campaigns.	另一个理论上较为流行的手段就是实施小型随机实验去考察提高入学率或者免疫项目的有效性。
Deaton rightly argues that this approach, now enshrined in World Bank procedures, is of very little use for understanding how to help a country develop more broadly.	迪顿正确地指出这个当前世界银行奉为至宝的方法对于认识如何帮助一个国家更大范围地发展是没什么作用的。
The results are often specific to a particular country’s circumstances, and there is no reason to presume that they would scale up when fully confronted with a developing country’s governance problems.	考察结果往往局限于某个国家的独特状况，也无法证明这些结果能广泛推广开来去应对一个发展中国家的治理问题。
The fact that people in several African countries appear to be worse off now than in 1960 is far more related to despotism and internal conflict than it is to the effectiveness of aid-delivery programs.	而多个非洲国家人民的生存状况比1960年代更加恶化的事实其实与专制独裁和内部冲突更加相关，而不是援助项目的有效性。
Despite these caveats, Deaton’s message is fundamentally positive.	尽管提出了这些警告，迪顿所传达出来的信息归根结底是积极正面的。
For most of mankind, now is a better time than ever before to be alive.	对于大多数人来说，如今的生活要比以往更好。
The path to development remains for others to follow.	发展的路径依旧等待其他人去跟随。
Highly targeted Western aid and advice can help, but donors must take more care not to stand in the way of the beneficiaries in assisting them.	高度针对性的西方援助和顾问工作依然有所裨益，但援助者们必须更加谨慎小心，不要阻碍了受援者获取帮助的道路。
	
A Tear for Argentina	为阿根廷流泪
CAMBRIDGE – Argentina’s latest default poses unsettling questions for policymakers.	美国剑桥—阿根廷最近的违约给决策者造成了令人不安的问题。
True, the country’s periodic debt crises are often the result of self-destructive macroeconomic policies.	诚然，该国时常发生的债务危机大多是自我破坏性宏观经济政策的结果。
But, this time, the default has been triggered by a significant shift in the international sovereign-debt regime.	但是，这一回，违约是由国际主权债务机制的重大变化引发的。
The shift favors hardline creditors in bond issuances governed by US law.	根据美国法律，这一变化有利于债券发行中的强硬债权人。
With emerging-market growth slowing, and external debt rising, new legal interpretations that make debt future write-downs and reschedulings more difficult do not augur well for global financial stability.	随着新兴市场增长放缓和外部债务增加，让未来债务减记和重新安排变得更加困难的新法律解释绝非全球金融稳定的福音。
There are no heroes in this story, certainly not Argentina’s policymakers, who a decade ago attempted unilaterally to force a massive generalized write-down on foreign bondholders.	在这个故事里没有英雄，阿根廷决策者显然不是，十年前他们试图单方面强行对外国债券持有人实施大规模的一般化减记。
Economists who trumpeted the “Buenos Aires consensus” as the new way to run economies also look foolish in hindsight.	有些经济学家将“布宜诺斯艾利斯共识”吹成经济运行新方式，事后看来这一观点也是相当愚蠢。
The International Monetary Fund has long recognized that it made one too many loans to try to save Argentina’s unsustainable dollar peg as it collapsed back in 2001.	国际货币基金组织很早就认识到，2001年不可持续的盯住美元政策崩溃时，它给了阿根廷太多的救命贷款。
This is not the first time that an Argentine default has upended international capital markets.	这不是阿根廷��机第一次扰动资本市场。
According to the tabulation that Carmen Reinhart and I compiled in our 2009 book This Time is Different, Argentina has defaulted on seven previous occasions – in 1827, 1890, 1951, 1956, 1982, 1989, and 2001.	卡门·莱因哈特（Carmen Reinhart）和我在2009年的书《这次不一样 》 （ This Time is Different）总结过一张表格，阿根廷此前已有七次违约记录 — — 分别在1827年、1890年、1951年、1956年、1982年、1989年和2001年。
Argentina may be almost as famous for its defaults as it is for its soccer teams, but it is hardly alone.	阿根廷的违约史和它的足球队一样著名，但它绝非孤例。
Virtually every emerging-market country has experienced recurrent sovereign-debt problems.	几乎所有新兴市场国家都经历过反复的主权债务问题。
Venezuela is the modern-day record holder, with 11 defaults since 1826 and possibly more to come.	委内瑞拉是现代纪录保持着，自1826年以来违约过11次，未来可能还会有更多次。
Back in 2003, partly in response to the Argentine crisis, the IMF proposed a new framework for adjudicating sovereign debts.	2003年，部分出于对阿根廷危机的反应，国际货币基金组织为裁定主权债务提出了一个新框架。
But the proposal faced sharp opposition not only from creditors who feared that the IMF would be too friendly to problem debtors, but also from emerging markets that foresaw no near-term risk to their perceived creditworthiness.	但这一建议不但受到担心国际货币基金组织对问题债务国太友好的债权国的反对，也受到预料到近期信誉可能遭到质疑的新兴市场的反对。
The healthy borrowers worried that creditors would demand higher rates if the penalties for default softened.	健康的债务人担心，如果违约惩罚放松，债权人就会要求更高的利率。
Recently, as an outgrowth of a reconsideration of the IMF’s lending to the periphery of Europe (and Greece in particular), the Fund has advanced another approach to debt rescheduling, one that might be easier to implement.	最近，国际货币基金组织考虑向欧洲外围（特别是希腊）提供贷款，在此过程中，该组织推出了另一个债务重新安排方针，这一方针实施起来更加容易。
The IMF now recognizes that the bulk of its financing was effectively being used to allow short-term creditors to exit loss-free.	国际货币基金组织现在认识到，其融资的大头实际上被用在了让短期债权人毫发无伤地全身而退上。
As a result, there was not enough money left over to help soften budget cuts necessitated by the sudden stop in foreign funding.	结果是没有足够的钱帮助减轻外国融资骤停所带来的不得不削减预算的压力。
The experience of the recent eurozone crisis stands in sharp contrast to the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980s, when banks were not allowed to exit precipitously from their loans.	最近的欧元区危机与20世纪80年代的拉美危机形成了鲜明对比。 在拉美危机中，银行不允许突然收回贷款。
If the new proposal is adopted, the IMF would conditionally refuse funds to countries carrying debt burdens that Fund staff determine are most likely unsustainable; creditors would first have to agree to a “reprofiling” of debt.	如果新方案被采用，国际货币进组织将有条件地拒绝将资金投入该组织所认定的债务负担最有可能无法持续下去的国家；债权人将第一次被迫同意债务的“重估 ” （ reprofiling ） 。
Reprofiling is a euphemism for debt restructuring, which allows countries to borrow from existing creditors for longer periods and at lower interest rates than they would be able to do on the open market.	重估是债务重组的委婉说法，它让各国以更长期限、更低利率从现有债权人处借钱，债务国在公开市场上无法获得这样的条件。
Although it is far from clear how easily the IMF could hold the line against hard-bargaining creditors, the new policy, if adopted, would toughen the Fund’s approach to cases where it finds itself repeatedly throwing good money after bad.	对于在谈判中态度强硬的债权人，国际货币基金组织是否可以自如地坚持原则还远未可知，但这一新政策如果被采用，将会收紧国际货币基金组织对一再事倍功半的国家的态度。
At present, the United States seems reluctant to go along with the IMF’s proposal.	目前，美国似乎不愿支持国际货币基金组织的方案。
Evidently, US authorities believe that in some situations geopolitics trump economics (reflected, for example, in the IMF’s recent re-entry into Ukraine after a string of failed programs).	显然，美国当局认为，在某些情形中，地缘政治比经济考虑更重要（比如，国际货币基金组织在一系列失败计划后最近再次进入乌克兰就是明证 ） 。
This American resistance is unfortunate.	美国的抵制是不幸的。
It would be far better if the US found ways simply to organize outright grants in exceptional cases like Ukraine, rather than design the international financial system around them.	如果美国能够设法为乌克兰这样的突出事件实施赠款，而不是设计围绕这些事件的国际金融系统，情况将会好得多。
Given the recurring complications of adjudicating sovereign-debt contracts in foreign courts, and the world’s inability to organize a credible and fair procedure for foreign bankruptcies, perhaps the best idea is to steer the bulk of international debt flows through debtor-country courts.	由于在外国法庭裁定主权债务合同会一再引发各种状况，而世界有不能阻止可信而公平的外国破产程序，也许最好的办法是通过债务国法院引导国际债务流大部的流向。
Jeremy Bulow and I made a proposal along these lines 25 years ago; it is still the right approach.	杰雷米·布罗（Jeremy Bulow）和我25年前曾 提出过一个这样的方案；现在它仍然是正确的方案。
In this scenario, countries interested in borrowing large amounts from abroad would need to develop institutions that made the promise to repay credible.	在这一情形中，有意从海外大量借贷的国家将需要发展让偿付承诺变得可靠的制度。
By and large, experience supports this method.	迄今为止的经验支持这一办法。
Indeed, the huge expansion in emerging-market domestic-debt issuance in recent years has helped reduce market tensions (though continuing reliance by corporates on foreign debt still leaves many countries vulnerable).	事实上，近几年来新兴市场国内债务发行量的暴增有助于减少市场紧张（尽管公司继续依赖外国债务仍然让许多国家十分脆弱 ） 。
But domestic borrowing is not a panacea.	但国内借贷并非万灵丹。
To believe that any country issuing debt in its own currency is risk-free as long as the exchange rate is flexible is astonishingly naive.	相信只要汇率具有弹性，一国以本国货币发行债务就是无风险的，这一观点是非常幼稚的。
For one thing, there is still inflation risk, particularly for countries with weak fiscal institutions and heavy debt burdens.	一方面，仍然需要面对通胀风险，特别是财政制度不健全、背负沉重债务负担的国家。
Nonetheless, Argentina’s latest debt trauma shows that the global system for sovereign-debt workouts remains badly in need of repair.	尽管如此，阿根廷最近的债务灾难表明，全球主权债务系统运转状况急需修正。
Deepening domestic debt markets – and perhaps change along the lines proposed by the IMF – is sorely needed.	深化国内债务市场 — — 也许可以依照国际货币基金组织提出的方针 — — 是极有必要的。
	
The Case for Burning Ivory	焚烧象牙的理由
JOHANNESBURG – Kenya is about to destroy its entire stockpile of elephant ivory.	约翰内斯堡 — — 肯尼亚即将销毁其全部的象牙库存。
More than 100 metric tons of “white gold” – both illegally harvested (confiscated from poachers or traders) and naturally accruing (from natural mortality) – will go up in smoke this weekend.	超过100吨的“白色黄金 ” — —无论是非法采集（从偷猎者或商人手里没收）还是自然累积（采集自自然死亡的大象 ） — —都将在本周末付之一炬。
In China – where the majority of the world’s ivory is consumed or stockpiled – the recently reported price is $1,100 per kilogram, putting the total value of the material to be burned at roughly $110 million.	在世界最主要的象牙消费或存储国中国，最新报价高达1，100美元每公斤，照此计算这批即将焚毁的象牙材料总价值约为1.1亿美元。
To most economists, the idea of destroying something with so much value is anathema.	多数经济学家认为销毁如此高价的物品令人不可思议。
But there are good reasons for a country – even one as poor as Kenya – to surrender its ivory wealth to the flames.	但即使对像肯尼亚这样的穷国来说，将象牙财富付之一炬理由也非常充分。
For starters, stockpile destruction fortifies the credibility of demand-reduction campaigns in East Asia, without which the poaching problem will never be solved.	首先，销毁库存强化了东亚需求削减活动的公信力，没有这样的公信力，偷猎问题也永远无法得到解决。
Demand reduction aims to weaken the market for the product by changing consumer tastes.	消费削减活动的目标是通过改变消费者的口味来削弱产品市场。
As prices drop, so does the incentive for poachers to kill elephants.	价格的下跌将影响偷猎者猎杀大象的积极性。
When countries keep their stockpiles, however, they signal that they anticipate being able to sell ivory in the future.	但当国家试图保留库存时，他们向外界表明希望能在未来出售这批象牙。
This undermines the credibility of demand-reduction efforts; if the trade is likely to be legalized one day, any stigma associated with ivory consumption will be eroded.	这在很大程度上损害了需求削减工作的公信力；如果有一天象牙贸易能够合法化，那么与象牙消费有关的任何耻辱均将遭到侵蚀。
Proponents of a regulated, legal international ivory trade argue that demand-reduction efforts can coexist with a limited legitimate supply.	合法管制国际象牙贸易的支持者认为需求削减工作可以和有限度的合法供应并存。
But this line of reasoning has a dangerous weakness: It assumes that a legal cartel – one proposed model for regulating supply – would crowd out illegal suppliers by providing ivory to the market at a lower cost.	但上述推理有一个危险的弱点：即假定合法卡特尔 — — 即需求管理的拟议模式之一 — — 会因为低成本向市场提供象牙而挤出非法的象牙供应。
This assumption is dubious at best.	这种假设充其量也不可全信。
The quantities traded through a legal mechanism would be insufficient to flood the market and suppress the price.	通过合法机制的象牙贸易数量完全不足以占领市场、打压价格。
Indeed, with legalized trade undermining demand-reduction efforts, the price of ivory is likely to remain high, ensuring that poaching continues.	事实上，在合法贸易破坏需求削减工作的情况下，象牙价格很有可能维持高位，从而保证偷猎活动能得以持续。
Some southern African countries argue that they should be allowed to sell their ivory in CITES-permitted, one-off sales to fund conservation efforts aimed at maintaining healthy elephant populations.	南部非洲某些国家认为应当允许他们按照《濒临绝种野生动植物国际贸易公约》的规定从事一次性的象牙销售活动，从而为保护健康象群的工作提供资金支持。
But, aside from the low probability in some countries that the revenue would be directed to that end, it is not clear that much money would be made.	但抛开某些国家不太可能将收入用于上述领域的情况不谈，这种方法能挣到多少钱依然是未知数。
Under CITES regulations, governments are permitted to sell only to other governments.	根据《濒临绝种野生动植物国际贸易公约》的规定，只允许在各国政府间进行贸易。
But what other governments are willing to pay may be as low as one-tenth of the illicit value.	但其他政府可能仅愿意支付非法贸易价值的区区十分之一。
And even then, governments can sell only naturally accrued ivory, not what was confiscated from poachers or illicit dealers.	而且即便如此，政府也只允许出售自然累积的象牙，从偷猎者或非法经销商手中没收的象牙不在其列。
China and the United States are in the process of formulating bans on domestic ivory trade, so it is not clear which governments would be interested in purchasing African stockpiles.	中美两国都在制定国内象牙贸易禁令，因此目前尚不清楚哪国政府会对购买非洲象牙库存感兴趣。
Vietnam and Laos are likely candidates, but they are also part of the infamous “golden triangle,” where illegal trade in wildlife and wildlife products continues to thrive.	越南和老挝虽然是可能的买家，但上述两国现实中是臭名昭著的“金三角”的组成部分，那里是野生动物及其产品非法贸易蓬勃发展的大本营。
The possibility of the legal ivory trade shifting to poorly regulated markets calls for a concerted international response, spearheaded by African governments through coalitions like the Elephant Protection Initiative, together with countries such as China.	合法象牙贸易可能转向监管不力的市场要求国际社会作出协调一致的反应，而牵头的理应是通过大象保护倡议联盟参与这项工作并与中国等国合作的非洲政府。
Preserving – rather than burning – stockpiles is the inefficient choice.	保留象牙库存是一种低效的选择，但焚毁不是。
Maintaining a stockpile is administratively and operationally expensive – and often pointless.	库存维护需要付出行政和运营成本 — — 而且往往毫无意义。
Inventory management is labor-intensive and technologically demanding.	库存管理属于劳动密集型项目，而且对技术有着很高的要求。
The ivory also must be air-conditioned to prevent the tusks from cracking or becoming brittle (important factors for attracting higher prices).	而且象牙必须在空调环境下保存，以防止破裂或者变脆（这是卖出高价的重要因素 ） 。
Given the low probability of being able to sell ivory in the future, the cost of storing and protecting it is unlikely to be recouped.	鉴于未来出售象牙的可能性十分之低，导致储存和保护成本不太可能被收回。
Meanwhile, criminal syndicates need only corrupt a handful of local officials to make off with the goods.	此外，犯罪集团仅需要向当地少数官员行贿即可带着象牙离开。
Then there are the high opportunity costs of investment in maintaining stockpiles.	再就是维护库存投资超高的机会成本。
The scarce human and financial resources allocated toward stockpile management could be more efficiently directed toward landscape preservation efforts (which can become self-sustaining over time through payment for ecosystem services).	用于库存管理的稀缺的人力和财力资源本来可以更为有效的运用于景观保护工作（这项工作从长远来看可以通过出售生态系统服务而逐步实现自我维系 ） 。
Finally, burning ivory worth millions of dollars has an undeniable symbolic impact.	最后，焚毁价值成百上千万美元的象牙能够带来无可辩驳的象征性冲击。
It sends a clear message: Ivory belongs to elephants and to no one else.	它向外界传递了一个明确的信号：象牙只属于大象，而不属于任何人。
And it makes clear that elephants are worth more alive than dead.	它清楚地告诉人们大象活着比死去更有价值。
Indeed, elephants’ value is anything but symbolic.	事实上，大象绝不仅仅具备象征性价值。
Elephants are a keystone species for preserving important ecosystems.	大象是保护重要生态系统的关键物种。
And yet rampant poaching is destroying elephant populations across Africa, killing, on average, 30,000 a year.	但猖獗的偷猎活动正在毁灭整个非洲大陆的大象种群，平均每年遭到猎杀的大象多达30,000头。
Poaching also has a negative impact on communities, benefiting a few at the expense of the many.	偷猎活动还对社会产生了负面影响，以牺牲多数人的代价来满足少数人的利益。
Recent research has shown that community conservancies (areas set aside for wildlife conservation) in northern Kenya are highly effective forms of landscape (and therefore elephant) preservation, provided the right incentives are in place.	最近的研究已经表明只要建立正确的激励机制，肯尼亚北部的社会保护区（也就是专门划定用于保护野生动物的区域）是景观（以及大象）保护的一种非常有效的形式。
This is important because in countries like Kenya and Tanzania, the majority of wildlife exists outside formally protected areas.	这一点之所以重要，是因为在肯尼亚和坦桑尼亚这样的国家，绝大多数野生动物都生活在正式划定的保护区以外。
Kenya should be commended for making a wise – and efficient – decision.	肯尼亚理当因为作出这一明智 — — 而且高效的 — — 决策而受到赞誉。
Its neighbors, as well as countries farther south, should follow its example.	其邻国以及更加靠南的非洲国家应当以其为榜样跟进。
Ideally, all range-state countries should destroy their stockpiles to overcome the regional collective action problem.	理想状况下，所有地区国家均应销毁象牙库存以解决地区集体行动问题。
Doing so would send an unmistakable signal to the global market: Ivory is not for sale, not now and not in the future.	这样做会向全球市场发出明确无误的信号：即象牙不允许出售，无论是现在还是将来。
	
A Massacre in Africa	非洲大屠杀
LONDON – Why is it that schools and schoolchildren have become such high-profile targets for murderous Islamist militants?	伦敦—为什么学校和在校学生成为杀人不眨眼的伊斯兰教武装分子如此的突出目标？
The 147 students killed in an attack by the extremist group Al-Shabab at a college close to Kenya’s border with Somalia are only the latest victims in a succession of outrages in which educational institutions have been singled out for attack.	极端组织青年党（Al-Shabab）最近袭击了一所肯尼亚靠近索马里边境地区的学院、杀戮147名学生。 这只是一连串以教育机构为袭击目标的暴行中的最新一次。
Last December, in Peshawar, Pakistan, seven Taliban gunmen strode from classroom to classroom in the Army Pubic School, executing 145 children and teachers.	去年12月，在巴基斯坦白沙瓦（Peshawar ） ， 七名塔利班分子持枪在军人子弟学校（Army Pubic School）杀害了145名儿童和教师。
More recently, as more than 80 pupils in South Sudan were taking their annual exams, fighters invaded their school and kidnapped them at gunpoint.	最近又有80多名南苏丹学生在期末考试时遭遇武装分子闯入学校，持枪将他们绑架。
Their fate has been to join the estimated 12,000 students conscripted into children’s militias in the country’s escalating civil war.	他们的命运是成为童子军加入该国愈演愈烈的内战，据估计和他们命运相同的学生已有12,000人。
Every day, another once-vibrant Syrian school is bombed or militarized, with two million children now in refugee camps or exiled to makeshift tents or huts.	每一天，都有曾经生气勃勃的叙利亚学校被轰炸或武装入侵，200万儿童沦落在难民营或居住在临时搭建的帐篷和小屋中。
And next week will mark the first anniversary of the extremist group Boko Haram’s night-time abduction of 276 schoolgirls from their dormitories in Chibok, in Nigeria’s northern Borno state.	一年前的下周，极端组织博科圣地（Boko Haram）趁夜间闯入尼日利亚北部的博尔诺州（Borno）奇伯克（Chibok）的一间学校，从学生宿舍中绑架了276名女生。
With continued assaults on local schools, Boko Haram has escalated its war against education – making the last two years Nigeria’s worst in terms of the violation of children’s rights.	博科圣地不断地袭击当地学校，掀起了一场针对教育的战争 — — 也让过去两年成为尼日利亚儿童权利侵害最严重的时期。
In the past five years, there have been nearly 10,000 attacks on schools and educational establishments.	在过去五年中，发生了近10,000起袭击学校和教育机构事件。
Why is it that schools, which should be recognized as safe havens, have become instruments of war, and schoolchildren have become pawns in extremists’ strategies?	为什么应该被视作安全港的学校会成为战争的工具，学生会成为极端分子战略中的人质？
And why have such attacks been treated so casually – the February abduction in South Sudan elicited barely any international comment – when they in fact constitute crimes against humanity.	为什么我们对待这些袭击事件如此心不在焉 — — 2月份的南苏丹绑架案几乎没有任何国际评论 — — 它们事实上已经构成了人道主义犯罪行为。
In the depraved minds of terrorists, each attack has its own simple logic; the latest shootings, for example, are revenge by Al-Shabab for Kenya’s intervention in Somalia’s civil war.	在恐怖分子的卑鄙思维中，每一次袭击都有一个自身的简单理由；比如，最近的枪击事件是青年党对肯尼亚干预索马里内战的报复。
But all of the recent attacks share a new tactic – to create shock by exceeding what even many of the most hardened terrorists had previously considered beyond the pale.	但所有的最近袭击都包含了一项新策略：通过让许多最死硬的恐怖分子此前都感到无法接受的暴行制造冲击波。
They have become eager to stoke publicity from the public outrage at their methods, even transmitting images of their crimes around the world.	他们渴望通过引起公众对他们所作所为的激愤获得知名度，他们甚至将暴行影像向全世界展示。
But there is an even more powerful explanation for this spate of attacks on children.	但对于这一袭击儿童的潮流，还有另一个更有力的解释。
A now-common extremist claim is that education is acculturating African and Asian children to Western ways of thinking (Boko Haram in the local Hausa dialect means “Western education is a sin”).	目前，一个常见的极端主义主张是教育让非洲和亚洲儿童与西方思维同化（博科圣地在其所在地豪萨（Hausa）方言中的意思是“西方教育是一种罪恶 ” ） 。
Moreover, extremists like Boko Haram and Al-Shabab calculate that they can attack schools with impunity.	此外，博科圣地和青年党这样的极端组织认为他们可以袭击学校并且逍遥法外。
Hospitals tend to be more secure, because the Geneva Conventions give them special protection as safe havens – a fact often recognized by even the most murderous of terrorist groups.	医院总是更加安全，因为日内瓦公约授予医院作为 安全港的特殊保护 — — 甚至是最杀人不眨眼的极端组织一般也承认这一事实。
Until recently, we have done far too little to protect schools and prevent their militarization during times of conflict.	到目前为止，我们在保护学校、防止学校在冲突期间军事化方面做得远远不够。
But, just as wars should never be waged by targeting hospitals, so combatants should never violate schools.	但是，正如战争绝不应该因为将目标对准医院而起，交战双方也绝不应该侵犯学校。
Once slow to respond, the world is now acting.	曾经反应缓慢的现在正在采取行动。
Thirty countries have recently signed up to the Lucens or Safe School guidelines, which instruct their military authorities how to prevent schools from being used as instruments of war.	最近，三十个国家签署了Lucens或安全学校指引，该指引指导军事当局如何防止学校沦为战争工具。
Leila Zerrougui, Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, recommends designating abductions of children from schools a “trigger violation” for the naming of terrorist organizations in the secretary-general’s annual report to the Security Council.	联合俄国秘书长儿童和武装冲突特别代表雷拉·泽罗圭（Leila Zerrougui）建议将从学校绑架儿童作为将极端组织列入联合国秘书长安理会年报的“触发事件 ” 。
And, thanks to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack, the Global Business Coalition for Education, and former Nigerian Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Nigeria has now piloted the concept of safe schools. This has meant funding school guards, fortifications, and surveillance equipment to reassure parents and pupils that everything possible is being done to ensure their school is safe to attend.	此外，在联合国儿童基金会（UNICEF ） 、 全球保护教育免受袭击联盟（Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack ） 、 全球教育商业联盟（Global Business Coalition for Education）和前尼日利亚外交部长恩戈齐·奥孔约-伊维拉（Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala）的努力下，尼日利亚已经成为安全学校概念的先锋。
Now, under Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan is adopting the safe school plan.	
In a year when there are more local conflicts than ever – and in which children have become among the first (and forgotten) casualties – it is urgent that we make stopping attacks on schools a high priority.	在地方冲突比以往任何时候都更频繁的一年里，在儿童成为首要受害群体（并且惨遭遗忘）的一年里，对于我们来说，将阻止袭击学校作为重中之重十分紧迫。
In dark times, children and parents continue to view their schools as sanctuaries, as places of normality and safety.	在黑暗时期，儿童和父母们继续将学校视为圣殿，视为道德和安全之所。
When law and order break down, people need not only material help – food, shelter, and health care – but also hope.	当法律和秩序崩溃时，人们需要的不仅是物质帮助 — — 食品、住所和医疗等 — — 还有希望。
There is no more powerful way to uphold the vision of a future free from conflict than by keeping schools running.	没有比让学校正常运行更强大的捍卫没有冲突的未来愿景的办法了。
	
A Loss for Kenyan Democracy	肯尼亚民主的教训
NAIROBI – On March 27, eight columnists from the Nation Media Group resigned from the Nation newspaper, citing a lack of editorial independence.	内罗毕—3月27日，八位国家传媒集团（Nation Media Group）专栏作家从《国家 》 （ Nation）报辞职，原因是缺乏编辑独立性。
For Kenya’s largest daily, the exodus of top talent was the latest blow to an already tarnished reputation.	对这份肯尼亚最大的日报来说，顶尖人才的出走只是对其已经败坏的名誉的最新一击。
The newspaper has suffered a series of embarrassing episodes in recent months, including high-profile firings, mass layoffs by the parent company, and allegations of state meddling in the editorial process.	近几个月来 ， 《 国家》经历了一系列尴尬，包括高管遭遇解雇、母公司大量裁员，以及关于国家干预编辑过程的指控。
But the resignations were more than another repudiation of a once-vaunted institution; they were a reminder that the media remain a powerful player in Kenya’s fledgling democracy.	但辞职事件的意义不仅仅是一个曾经名高望重的机构的唾弃；它提醒我们，媒体仍然是初出茅庐的肯尼亚民主的强大参与者。
When governments constrain journalists – in Kenya or elsewhere – they do so at their own peril.	当政府控制记者时 — — 不论在肯尼亚还是在其他地方 — — 都会自食其果。
Like many African countries, Kenya has a long tradition of what might be called “activist journalism” – the dissemination of news and ideas to inspire political or social action.	同许多非洲国家一样，肯尼亚有相当长的可称之为“积极新闻 ” （ activist journalism）的传统 — — 传播新闻和思想启发政治或社会行动。
The practice has its roots in anti-colonialism; when the Nation was founded in 1960, it joined other pan-African publications like the New African and Drum to oppose colonial rule.	这一行为有其反殖民主义根源；1960年《国家》创立时，便和《新非洲人 》 （ New African）和《鼓声 》 （ Drum）等泛非洲出版物一道反对殖民统治。
By giving Kenyans a platform to voice their dissent, the Nation – led by its journalists – helped protesters articulate the ideas, slogans, and catchphrases that animated their movements.	《国家》给了肯尼亚人一个发出异见的平台，在它的记者的领导下，它帮助示威群众构思概念、口号和标语，生动展现他们的运动。
For many columnists, simply writing for these magazines was an act of resistance.	对许多专栏作家来说，为这些杂志写作便是一种抵抗活动。
In the West, activist journalism carries a negative connotation, suggesting bias.	在西方，积极新闻含有贬义，暗指偏见。
But in Africa, this type of journalism has historically kept the media honest by forcing owners to focus more on public good than on profit.	但在非洲，这种新闻在历史上通过迫使所有者更多地关注公共利益而非利润，从而保持媒体的诚实。
In Kenya, however, this model is being eroded by the flow of public funds into private media outlets in advertising and through increasing repression.	但在肯尼亚，这一模式因为公共资金在私人媒体上做广告以及日益激烈的镇压而受到制约。
The media industry in Kenya is more lucrative than in most African countries, which has led some to assume that Kenya’s press is free.	肯尼亚传媒业比大部分非洲国家利润更高，这让一些人认为肯尼亚的媒体是自由的。
But, increasingly, the opposite is true.	但情况日益与此相反。
Many media companies are dependent on government advertising revenue, and, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, this spending is being used as leverage by the authorities to censor unfavorable coverage.	许多媒体公司依赖政府广告收入，据保护记者委员会（Committee to Protect Journalists ） ， 这笔支出被当局用来审查不利的报道。
This is one element of the “state capture of the media” that the eight Nation columnists cited in resigning.	这就是八位辞职《国家》专栏作家所说的“国家俘虏媒体”的要素之一。
To be sure, official censorship is not new in Kenya.	平心而论，官方审查在肯尼亚不是新鲜事。
After an attempted coup in 1982, many smaller newspapers were shut down by the state, and between 1988 and 1990, at least 20 newspapers were forced to cease publication permanently.	1982年未遂政变后，许多小报纸被国家关闭，1988—1990年间，至少有20家报纸被迫永久停止发行。
And yet, even during periods of government repression, savvy journalists have always found audiences for their dissenting views.	但是，即使在政府压迫时期，聪明的记者也总能找到异见观点的受众。
During Kenya’s democracy movement in the 1990s, one of the most influential was Wahome Mutahi, a humorist who skirted state control to parody the authoritarian president, Daniel Toroitich arap Moi.	20世纪90年代肯尼亚民主运动年其间，最有影响力人之一是幽默作家瓦赫姆·木塔希（Wahome Mutahi ） ， 他绕过国家管制，模仿极权总统莫伊。
Mutahi eventually spent 15 months in the infamous Nyayo House torture chambers as punishment for his writings.	木塔希最终因为他的文字而在臭名昭著的那雅约大楼（Nyayo House）经历了15个月的折磨。
Kenyan media experienced a revival in the post-Moi era; by 2012, the country had 301 radio stations and 83 television stations, up from only three television networks in the 1990s.	莫伊下台后，肯尼亚媒体经历了复兴；到2012年，肯尼亚有301家广播台和83家电视台，而20世纪90年代时只有三个电视网络。
But the growth in media outlets and liberalization of the country’s politics did not translate into more press freedom.	但新闻媒体的增长和国家政治的自由化并未转化为更多新闻自由。
Instead, after a brief reprieve between successful elections in 2002 and post-election violence in 2007, journalists were targeted once more.	相反，在从成功的2002年选举到2007年选举后暴力期间的短暂放松后，记者再一次成为目标。
Crackdowns have ranged from the severe – including detention, torture, and disappearances – to the subtle.	镇压有的严酷 — — 包括羁押、拷打和消灭 — — 有的微妙。
For example, when the political cartoonist Godfrey Mwampembwa, known as Gado, was forced from his post at the Nation in 2016, his bosses didn’t explicitly fire the newspaper’s most popular contributor.	比如，2016年政治漫画家古德弗雷·姆万彭瓦（Godfrey Mwampembwa，以加多（Gado）的名字为人所知）被迫从《国家》的岗位上离职。 他的老板并没有直接炒掉这位最受欢迎的供稿人的鱿鱼。
Rather, they simply refused to renew his contract when it expired.	相反，他只是合同到期不续签而已。 同样的事情也发生在大卫·恩迪（David Ndii）身上。
The same thing happened to David Ndii, an economist and opposition-affiliated columnist for the Sunday Nation.	恩迪是一位经济学家为《周日国家 》 （ Sunday Nation）撰写反对意见专栏。
But these dismissals pale in comparison to a government-imposed blackout in early February.	但这些离职与2月初的政府行动相比只是小巫见大巫。
To prevent journalists from reporting on a political rally by then-opposition leader Raila Odinga, the Kenyan government forced three private television stations off the air for days, ignoring court orders to end the blockade.	为了阻止记者报道当时的反对派领导人雷拉·奥丁加（Raila Odinga）所举行的示威，肯尼亚政府强迫三家私人电视台停播多日，完全无视法院停止播送管制的裁决。
Journalists at one station, Nation Television, huddled in their offices as they coordinated with lawyers and sought to avoid arrest.	其中一家电视台国家电视台（Nation Television）的记者们被堵在办公室中，与律师合作寻求避免被捕。
When the dust eventually settled, executives from all three networks had resigned.	事件过去后，所有三甲电视网络的高管都辞去了职务。
Without courageous, pioneering journalists, Kenya’s pro-democracy movement may never have succeeded.	如果没有敢为天下先的记者，肯尼亚的亲民主运动可能永远不会成功。
Activist columnists helped the public understand political decisions by making policy accessible.	积极专栏作家普及了政策，帮助公众理解政治决定。
In Mutahi’s case, the use of his own family in his parodies was a device intended to demonstrate that petty domestic despotism was no different from the political tyranny orchestrated by an autocratic president.	在木塔希的例子中，在模仿中用自己的家人是一个策略，意在证明小家的独裁与政治暴君式的极权总统没有什么区别。
Kenyans need similar means of reflection today.	如今，肯尼亚人需要类似的思考方式。
And yet, just when the country’s democratic institutions could most benefit from such a mirror, those who have historically held it up now believe they have no alternative but to put it down.	但是，就在肯尼亚民主制度可以成为这面明镜的最大受益者的同时，在历史上坚持这样做的人现在却相信他们别无选择，只能镇压。
For Kenya, the very public decline of the Nation has come at a high cost.	对肯尼亚来说 ， 《 国家》的公开陨落代价高昂。
But it has also demonstrated that press freedom means much more than letting journalists say what they want, when they want, and how they want.	但这也说明，新闻自由远不止于让记者言所欲言，随时发言，不拘一格。
It also means holding media owners accountable.	新闻自由还意味着问责媒体所有者。
A highly competitive electoral system framed by a compromised media is more likely to fuel dissent than to stem it, and Kenya’s democracy will suffer so long as the country’s stewards of public enlightenment turn their backs on it.	一个由妥协的媒体制定的高度竞争性的选举制度更有可能助推而不是阻止异见，而肯尼亚的民主将因为肯尼亚公众启蒙的领航者的倒行逆施而蒙受损失。
	
Good Fences Make Safe Species	好隔离制造安全物种
NAIROBI – African countries are often criticized for failing to meet their environmental challenges.	内罗毕—非洲国家常常被批评没有很好应对环境挑战。
Observers often cite loss of habitat in the face of population growth, land degradation, and industrialization.	观察者常用的论据包括人口增长导致栖息地收缩、土地退化以及工业化。
And then there is the most frequent charge of all: that an increase in poaching is endangering species such as elephants and rhinos.	还有最常用的指责：非法狩猎的日渐增加正在威胁大象和犀牛等物种的生存。
In Kenya, however, an innovative and extensive conservation project is underway.	但是，在肯尼亚，人们已开始实施一项创新性大范围保护措施。
Begun in the Aberdare mountains in central Kenya, “Rhino Ark,” originally conceived to protect the highly endangered black rhino from the ravages of poachers, is supported by the very people who might have resisted it: the local communities in some of the country’s most productive farming areas.	这项称为“犀牛方舟 ” （ Rhino Ark）措施从肯尼亚中部的亚伯达（Aberdare）山区开始，初衷是为了保护高度濒危的黑犀牛免遭偷猎，并得到了最有可能反对它的人 — — 肯尼亚产量最高的农场地区的本地居民的支持。
In 1988, conservationists decided to finance and build an electrified fence to protect an area of the Aberdare National Park bordering smallholder farms.	1988年，环保人士决定筹资兴建电网以保护毗邻小农农场的亚伯达国家公园。
The fence was designed to prevent intrusion from the human population and degradation of the park’s habitat.	这条电网是为了防止人类闯入保护区和国家公园栖息地的退化。
But it also protected the farmers, whose crops were regularly being destroyed by marauding elephant and other wildlife.	但它也保护了农民，此前他们的庄稼常常被大象和其他野生动物破坏。
Local farmers welcomed the initiative, which influenced the decision to expand the fence to surround the perimeter of the entire Aberdare range.	本地农民很欢迎这项措施，这促使肯尼亚决定将电网范围扩大，将整个亚伯达山区包括进来。
The Aberdare Mountains, encompassing 2,000 square kilometers of indigenous forest and vital water catchment areas, as well as a national park, are vital to Kenya.	亚伯达山区包括2,000平方公里的天然森林和水源汇集区，以及一个国家公园，对肯尼亚来说至关重要。
Four of the country’s largest rivers, flowing north, west, east and south, begin there, providing water and power to seven major towns, including the capital, Nairobi.	肯尼亚的四条最大河流分别从东南西北四个方向汇聚在此，为大城镇提供水和电力，包括首都内罗毕。
On the mountains’ lower slopes, four million farmers benefit from rich soil and plentiful rainfall.	在山区地势较低的地方生活着四百万农民，接受着肥沃的土壤和充足的降水的馈赠。
In the foothills and high slopes, 30% of Kenya’s tea and 70% of its coffee are produced.	山脚和高坡出产了肯尼亚30%的茶叶和70%的咖啡。
For 21 years, the fence around the Aberdares was painstakingly built, supported mainly by Kenya’s corporate sector, individual donors, and innovative fundraising exercises such as the Rhino Charge, an off-road motor event that has captured the Kenyan public’s imagination and annually raises more than $1 million.	21年来，环绕亚伯达的电网的建设可谓费尽心思，其资金主要来自肯尼亚企业、个人捐赠和创新性筹资活动。 后者包括一项名为“犀牛冲锋 ” （ Rhino Charge）的筹资运动，这次越野车比赛吸引了肯尼亚公众的想象力，每年筹资超过100万美元。
But, by the time the fully electrified fence was completed, in 2009, the government, under then-President Mwai Kibaki, had become an essential partner, with the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) and the Kenya Forest Service (KFS) deeply involved in the project.	但是，到2009年电网全部建成时，时任总统齐贝吉（Mwai Kibaki）的政府已成为最重要的合作方，肯尼亚野生动物协会（KWS）和肯尼亚森林协会（KFS）也深深卷入了这一工程。
With Kenyan government backing, Rhino Ark has been able to turn its attention to other forested but degraded areas – such as Mount Eburu in the Mau Forests Complex, overlooking Lake Naivasha, and Mount Kenya, a World Heritage Site that has been heavily affected by human-wildlife conflicts.	在肯尼亚政府的支持下，犀牛方舟得以将注意力转向其他有森林覆盖但已退化的地区 — — 比如鸟瞰纳伊瓦沙湖（Lake Naivasha）马乌林地（Mau Forests Complex）厄布鲁山（Mount Eburu）和饱受人与野生动物冲突困扰的世界遗���肯尼亚山（Mount Kenya ） 。
The 45-kilometer Mount Eburu fence was completed last year.	45公里长的厄布鲁山电网去年完工。
The Mount Kenya fence, at 450 kilometers, will be longer than the Aberdares’ project and is now making rapid progress, with 80 kilometers completed.	肯尼亚山电网长达450公里，比亚伯达工程还要长，目前正在迅速推进中，已完成80公里。
Of course, building a fence is just the beginning.	当然，建设电网只是开始。
Fences must be managed and maintained (some of the original fence posts in the Aberdares, for example, have had to be replaced), wildlife corridors must be developed, and local communities require support.	电网必须得到管理和维护（比如，亚伯达山区最初建设的一些电网桩已经需要更换 ） ， 还必须保留野生动物迁徙通道，当地社区也需要支持。
All areas are kept under surveillance by air and foot patrols along the fence line – a constant monitoring process with considerable cost implications.	所有地区都由电网空中和地面巡逻队负责监督 — — 这项长期监督活动将带来巨大的成本。
The benefits, however, are significant.	但是，收益也是巨大的。
The fences keep the authorities fully alert to any incidents of poaching – particularly of elephant, rhino, and exceptionally rare species such as the Mountain Bongo antelope, which now exist only in the Aberdares, Mount Kenya, and the Mau Forests Complex, including Mount Eburu.	电网能够向当局报警任何偷猎事件 — — 特别是大象、犀牛和山地紫羚等濒危物种。 后者现在只生存于亚伯达、肯尼亚山和包括厄布鲁山在内的马乌林地。
Local communities are involved in all areas of fence and forest maintenance.	在所有电网和森林保护区都存在当地社区。
In effect, they are the guardians of the fences, keeping them clear of vegetation and repairing damage caused by wildlife and other factors – and learning new skills in the process.	事实上，他们是电网的守护者，负责清理周边植被和修复因野生动物和其他因素造成的损坏情况 — — 并在此过程中学习新技能。
The longer-term goal is the protection of these critical forests in perpetuity.	长期目标是永远保护这些关键森林。
To achieve this, endowment funds are being established as public-private partnerships, bringing together the Rhino Ark, the KWS and the KFS, and representatives from local communities.	为了实现这一目标，肯尼亚正在建立捐赠基金，由犀牛方舟、KWS和KFS，以及来自地方社区的代表共同商议。
So-called trust deeds, set up locally, will manage these funds, which will eventually pay for the fences’ maintenance.	所谓的（当地）信托契约将负责管理这些资金，最终用于电网的维护。
The Aberdare Trust Deed became effective last October.	亚伯达信托契约已于去年10月生效。
The region’s hard-working farmers can now see added value in co-existing with the fence.	该地区勤劳的农民现在已经看见与电网共存所带来的新价值。
Since the completion of the Aberdares fence, the value of local farmers’ land has quadrupled.	自亚伯达电网完工以来，当地农民的土地价值翻了两番。
They can work their fields in peace for the first time in more than a century, their children can walk to and from school without fear of being attacked by wild animals, and conservation is now part of the curriculum.	一百多年来，他们第一次可以平静地耕种土地，他们的孩子可以往返学校而不必担心受到野生动物的袭击，而环境保护也已列入学校课程。
The main lesson is straightforward: Good fences are good for everyone.	主要教训显而易见：好的隔离对所有人都好。
	
Will the Kerch Blockade Make Putin Great Again?	刻赤封锁能让普京再次伟大吗？
MOSCOW – Millions of people have now watched a video of a Russian coast guard vessel ramming a Ukrainian tugboat in the Kerch Strait. For some Russians, this show of force undoubtedly aroused a sense of pride, much to President Vladimir Putin’s pleasure.	莫斯科—眼下，已有数百万人观看了刻赤海峡俄罗斯边防船拦截乌克兰拖船的视频，如此展现武力显然激发了一种自豪感，令总统普京感到满意。
But for many others, the footage evoked feelings of fear at the prospect of a full-blown war in Ukraine.	但对其他很多人来说，这一镜头引起了一种担忧，对乌克兰爆发全面战争的担忧。
Most Russian parents, like parents everywhere, would prefer to send their 18-year-old children to study, not to fight.	大部分俄罗斯家长和全世界家长一样，更愿意把18岁的孩子送去读书而不是打仗。
The narrative that Russia is under attack has long dominated Kremlin propaganda, with Putin positioning himself as the commander of a fortress besieged – militarily, economically, and even in the domain of international sports – by a hostile West.	克里姆林宫的宣传向来主要渲染俄罗斯遭到袭击，而普京就是陷入敌对的西方重围的城堡上的指挥官 — — 军事、经济乃至国际体育领域的指挥官。
This propaganda, already building in volume in 2012, after Putin won his third presidential term, reached a crescendo in 2014, after the annexation of Crimea.	这一宣传在2012年普京赢得第三个总统任期后开始大量出现，2014年吞并克里米亚后更是变本加厉。
So far, there has been no diminuendo, and there is unlikely to be one so long as Putin’s siege narrative strategy continues to yield political dividends.	目前，这一宣传丝毫没有减弱迹象，而只要普京的围困叙事战略继续产生政治红利，这一状况也不太可能发生改变。
Prior to the annexation of Crimea, his approval rating had dropped to record lows; afterwards, it surged to more than 80%.	在吞并克里米亚之前，他的支持率曾经降到历史最低点；吞并克里米亚之后，他的支持率一举超过80 % 。
But, since last summer, Putin’s approval ratings have again dropped precipitously, to 66% in October and November.	但自夏天以来，普京的支持率再次急剧下降，在10到11月份下降至66 % 。
Beyond “making Russia great again” on the international stage, Putin was supposed to improve Russians’ standard of living.	除了在国际舞台上“让俄罗斯再次伟大 ” ， 普京还应该改善俄罗斯人的生活水平。
Instead, after four years of falling real incomes, the government announced deeply unpopular pension reforms, which included an increase in the retirement age.	相反，在真实收入连降四年的情况下，政府又退出了非常不受欢迎的退休金改革，包括提高退休年龄。
Addressing Russians’ economic grievances will not be easy.	解决俄罗斯人的经济仇恨并非易事。
Russia’s economy is under severe strain as a result of the sanctions imposed by the West over Crimea.	俄罗斯经济因为西方对克里米亚的制裁而承受巨大压力。
More important, Russia’s state-capitalist model has led to weak competition and declining incentives for private investment and entrepreneurship.	更重要的是，俄罗斯国家资本主义模式导致竞争不足，私人投资和企业家精神激励下降。
With few options for rallying public opinion, Putin may well have decided that it is time to “remind” Russians that they are under attack.	普京已想不出办法扭转公众看法，可能因此认为是时候“提醒”俄罗斯人他们正在受到攻击了。
(Ukraine’s president, Petro Poroshenko, may also benefit politically from escalating tensions as he seeks to lift his dismal approval ratings ahead of his reelection bid in March.)	（乌克兰总统波罗申科为了在3月的连任竞选中提升其萎靡不振的支持率而选择让紧张局面升级，这也有可能给普京带来政治好处。 ）
To be clear, Ukraine is not attacking Russia.	明确一点：乌克兰没有攻击俄罗斯。
The Ukrainian naval vessels were in full compliance with a 2003 bilateral treaty governing access to the Kerch Strait and the Sea of Azov.	乌克兰海军舰只完全遵守约束刻赤海峡和亚速海航行的2003年双边条约。
But, by asserting that the vessels entered Russian waters illegally, not to mention escalating tensions with the West, Putin may be hoping to breathe new life into the siege narrative, thereby inspiring the kind of primitive patriotism on which he has long relied.	但普京宣称乌克兰舰只非法进入俄罗斯领海，甚至不惜升级与西方的紧张对立，可能是希望借此为围困叙事注入新鲜活力，从而激发他长期所依赖的原始爱国主义。
This could involve direct provocations and potentially even armed clashes.	这可能包括直接挑衅甚至武装冲突。
But Putin is likely also to draw more public attention to Russia’s military-industrial complex and weapons development, while celebrating past glory, especially the mythologized version of World War II that he has established as a component of his own legitimacy.	但普京可能会将更多公共目光转向俄罗斯军工行业和武器开发，同时庆祝昔日荣光，特别是传说式的二战叙事 — — 他已经将这打造为自己的遗产的一部分。
For example, the veneration of Stalin, with whom Putin shares more than a few traits, has no doubt contributed to many Russians’ greater willingness to accept repression.	比如，斯大林崇拜 — — 普京身上颇可以找到一些斯大林的影子 — — 显然让许多俄罗斯人对镇压有了更大的接受度。
The grand military parade commemorating the anniversary of the end of the Siege of Leningrad, planned for January 29 in St. Petersburg, may inspire patriotism, but it will in no way reflect the real drama of the city’s starving inhabitants.	1月29日，圣彼得堡将举行列宁格勒保卫战胜利大阅兵，这可能会激发爱国主义，但并不能反映这座城市挨饿的居民的真实情景。
Still, Putin’s nationalist appeals may well be insufficient to rally public opinion this time, not least because, among Russians, animosity toward the West – which is now linked to Ukraine in the minds of many – has waned.	尽管如此，这一回普京的民族主义号召可能不足以刺激民意，因为俄罗斯人对西方的仇视 — — 在许多人看来，现在的西方和乌克兰已经联系在一起 — — 已经消退。
In this sense, another glory-drenched commemoration planned for January in Novgorod might turn out to be more true to history than intended.	从这个角度讲，另一场计划于1月在诺夫哥罗德举行的光荣历史庆典可能会更加符合历史。
In the “Great Waltz” of July 1944 – which the Novgorod event will reenact – 57,000 German prisoners of war were marched through the streets of Moscow, Stalin’s goal being to humiliate the Germans and remind Muscovites of their hatred for their enemies.	在1944年7月的“翠堤春晓 ” （ Great Waltz）事件中 — — 诺夫哥罗德的庆典将再现这一幕 — — 57,000名德国战俘在莫斯科游街示众，斯大林此举的目的是羞辱德国人，同时提醒莫斯科人憎恨他们的敌人。
But, in the event, many Russians pitied the prisoners, and some even threw bread to them.	但是，在这场游行中，许多俄罗斯人同情战俘，甚至向他们投掷面包。
When sociologists from the Levada Center recently asked 20-year-old Russians to identify the country they view as a model for others, they chose Germany, followed by China and Putin’s favorite villain, the United States.	列瓦达中心（Levada Center）的社会学家最近调查20岁的俄罗斯人哪个国家可以作为其他国家的榜样，他们选择了德国，然后是中国和普京最爱的反派美国。
While these young people support Russian greatness, they define greatness not only in military terms, but also on the basis of economic prosperity and social progress.	这些年轻人也支持俄罗斯的伟大，但他们所定义的伟大不仅是军事上的伟大，也包括经济繁荣和社会进步等方面。
It does not help that Putin’s foreign-policy gambits have become increasingly dubious.	普京外交政策主题变得越来越值得怀疑，这绝非好事。
It is hard for many Russians to see why their leaders have channeled so many resources to Syria when there are such pressing challenges at home.	很多俄罗斯人难以理解他们的领导人为什么要向叙利亚投入如此多的资源，而让他们在国内饱受压力。
Watching a Russian boat ram a Ukrainian boat is no substitute for economic opportunities.	目睹俄罗斯船只阻挡乌克兰船只并不能代替经济机会。
For a long time, the slogan “we can repeat” – a reference to the Soviet Union’s WWII victory – was popular in Russia.	长期以来 ， “ 我们能重复”的口号在俄罗斯非常流行，这句话说的是苏联的二战胜利。
But the truth is that we cannot.	但真相是我们不能。
We lack not only the resources, but also the will to let our young people die fighting another country’s young people.	我们不但缺少资源，也不愿意让我们的年轻人与另一个国家的年轻人作战而死。
Indeed, the last thing Russians want is to repeat a war that left 27 million of their countrymen dead.	事实上，俄罗斯人最不想要的就是重复一场让2,700万同胞死亡的战争。
	
When Shall We Overcome?	我们何时才会胜利？
NEW YORK – In 1967, riots erupted in cities throughout the United States, from Newark, New Jersey, to Detroit and Minneapolis in the Midwest – all two years after the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles exploded in violence.	发自纽约 — — 1967年，在洛杉矶的华兹（Watts）社区出现暴力事件两年后，美国各地 — — 从新泽西州的纽瓦克到中西部明尼阿波利斯的底特律 — — 纷纷爆发了骚乱。
In response, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed a commission, headed by Illinois Governor Otto Kerner, to investigate the causes and propose measures to address them.	为此总统林登·约翰逊指派了一个由伊利诺伊州州长奥托·克纳（Otto Kerner）领导的委员会去调查事件成因并提出相应对策。
Fifty years ago, the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders (more widely known as the Kerner Commission), issued its report, providing a stark account of the conditions in America that had led to the disorders.	五十年前，全国民事骚乱咨询委员会（人称克纳委员会）发表一份报告，毫不留情地描述出了骚乱背后的美国社会状况。
The Kerner Commission described a country in which African-Americans faced systematic discrimination, suffered from inadequate education and housing, and lacked access to economic opportunities.	克纳委员会指出非裔美国人面临着系统性的歧视，遭受着求学无门，住房短缺，经济机会匮乏等种种不公。
For them, there was no American dream.	对他们来说美国梦是不存在的。
The root cause was “the racial attitude and behavior of white Americans toward black Americans.	其根源是“美国白人对黑人的种族歧视态度和行为。
Race prejudice has shaped our history decisively; it now threatens to affect our future.”	种族偏见无疑塑造了我们的历史；但现在又威胁到了我们的未来 。 ”
I was part of a group convened by the Eisenhower Foundation to assess what progress had been made in the subsequent half-century.	艾森豪威尔基金会曾经召集成立了一个小组，旨在评估在报告出台后的半个世纪中所取得的进展，而笔者则是小组成员之一。
Sadly, the Kerner Commission report’s most famous line – “Our Nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white – separate and unequal” – still rings true.	可悲的是，我发现克纳委员会报告中最著名的论断 — — “我们的国家正在分裂成为两个社会群体，一个是黑人，一个是白人 — — 既互相隔离又不平等 ” — —在今天依然有效。
The just-published book based on our efforts, Healing Our Divided Society: Investing in America Fifty Years After the Kerner Report, edited by Fred Harris and Alan Curtis, makes for bleak reading.	而凝聚了小组研究成果的新书 — — 《治愈我们分裂的社会：在克纳报告发布五十年后的调查》编辑：弗雷德·哈里斯（Fred Harris ） / 艾伦·柯蒂斯（Alan Curtis ） — —并不是一本令人愉悦的读物。
As I wrote in my chapter, “Some problematic areas identified in the Kerner Report have gotten better (participation in politics and government by black Americans – symbolized by the election of a black president), some have stayed the same (education and employment disparities), and some have gotten worse (wealth and income inequality).” Other chapters discuss one of the most disturbing aspects of America’s racial inequality: inequality in securing access to justice, reinforced by a system of mass incarceration largely targeted at African-Americans.	正如我在自己负责的那章中写道 ： “ 克纳报告中某些问题严重的领域已经得到改善（黑人的政治和政府参与，以一位黑人总统的当选为标志 ） ， 有的保持不变（教育和就业不平等 ） ， 有的则变得更糟（财富和收入不平等 ） ” 书中其他章节则讨论了美国种族不平等中最令人不安的一个方面：确保获取司法公正方面的不平等，而且这种不平等还被一个主要针对非裔美国人的大规模监禁体系所强化。
There is no doubt that the civil rights movement of a half-century ago made a difference.	毋庸置疑，半个世纪前的民权运动确实实现了一些改变。
A variety of overt forms of discrimination were made illegal.	各种明显的歧视形式都被定为非法。
Societal norms changed.	社会规范也有所改变。
But rooting out deep-seated and institutional racism has proven difficult.	但要铲除根深蒂固且制度化种族主义则相当困难。
Worse, President Donald Trump has exploited this racism and fanned the flames of bigotry.	更糟糕的是特朗普总统正是利用了这种种族主义并助长了偏见的火焰。
The core message of the new report reflects the great insight of the civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr.: achieving economic justice for African-Americans cannot be separated from achieving economic opportunities for all Americans.	新报告的核心信息印证了民权运动领袖马丁·路德·金的深刻洞见：实现对非裔美国人的经济正义不能与实现所有美国人的经济机会分开。
King called his August 1963 march on Washington, which I joined and at which he delivered his ringing, unforgettable “I Have a Dream” speech, a march for jobs and freedom.	他将1963年8月在华盛顿的游行 — — 他正是在那里发表了充满力量且令人难忘的“我有一个梦想”演讲，而笔者也参与了游行 — — 称之为一场争取工作和自由的游行。
And yet the economic divide in the US has grown much wider, with devastating effects on those without a college education, a group that includes almost three-quarters of African-Americans.	然而在此之后美国经济鸿沟却日益拉宽，对那些没有受过大学教育的人产生了毁灭性的影响，而该群体里包含了近3/4的非裔美国人。
Beyond this, discrimination is rampant, if often hidden.	除此之外歧视现象依然猖獗，而且往往是以隐藏的形式。
America’s financial sector targeted African-Americans for exploitation, especially in the years before the financial crisis, selling them volatile products with high fees that could, and did, explode.	美国的金融业有针对性地剥削非裔美国人，尤其是在金融危机之前，专门向他们销售一些可能 — — 也最终 — — 崩盘的高费率高波动性产品。
Thousands lost their homes, and in the end, the disparity in wealth, already large, increased even more.	成千上万的人因此失去了家园，而最终本已巨大的财富差距又被拉宽了许多。
One leading bank, Wells Fargo, paid huge fines for charging higher interest rates to African-American and Latino borrowers; but no one was really held accountable for the many other abuses.	其中一家主要银行 — — 富国银行 — — 因为向非裔美国人和拉丁裔借款人收取更高利息而遭受巨额罚款；但没有人真正为许多其他侵权行为负责。
Almost a half-century after the enactment of anti-discrimination laws, racism, greed, and market power still work together to the disadvantage of African-Americans.	在反歧视法出台近半个世纪后，种族主义，贪婪和市场力量仍在一起努力给非裔美国人挖坑。
There are, however, several reasons for hope.	然而还有几个因素让我们不至于放弃希望。
First, our understanding of discrimination is far better.	首先我们如今对歧视的理解要深刻得多。
Back then, the Nobel laureate economist Gary Becker could write that in a competitive market, discrimination was impossible; the market would bid up the wage of anyone who was underpaid.	当年诺贝尔奖经济学奖得主加里·贝克尔（Gary Becker）可以认定在竞争激烈的市场上歧视是不可能存在的；市场会提高所有收入不足者的工资。
Today, we understand that the market is rife with imperfections – including imperfections of information and competition – that provide ample opportunity for discrimination and exploitation.	今天，我们知道市场充斥着不完善之处 — — 包括信息和竞争的不充分 — — 从而为歧视和剥削提供了充足的机会。
Moreover, we now recognize that the US is paying a high price for inequality, and an especially high price for its racial inequality.	此外我们现在认识到美国正在为不平等付出高昂的代价，而且在种族不平等的代价尤其高。
A society marked by such divisions will not be a beacon to the world, and its economy will not flourish.	以这种分裂为特征的社会不会成为世界的灯塔，其经济也无法蓬勃发展。
The real strength of the US is not its military power but its soft power, which has been badly eroded not just by Trump, but also by persistent racial discrimination.	美国的真正力量并不在于军事而是其软实力，但这已经被特朗普以及持续的种族歧视所严重侵蚀。
Everyone will lose if it is not addressed.	如果这点无法得到解决，每个人都会成为输家。
The most promising sign is the outpouring of activism, especially from young people, who realize that it is high time that the US lives up to its ideals, so nobly expressed in its Declaration of Independence, that all men are created equal.	而最有希望的迹象来自于一大批行动起来的人（特别是年轻人 ） ， 他们意识到美国应该奉行自身的理念，正如在《独立宣言》中高尚地申明那样：人生而平等。
A century and a half after the abolition of slavery, the legacy of that system lingers.	在废除奴隶制一个半世纪之后，这一制度的遗毒却尚未肃清。
It took a century to enact legislation ensuring equal rights; but today, Republican-controlled courts and politicians often renege on that commitment.	我们花了一个世纪制定法律以确保平等权利; 但如今共和党控制下的法院和政客却经常违背这一承诺。
As I concluded my chapter, “An alternative world is possible. But 50 years of struggle has shown us how difficult it is to achieve that alternative vision.”	正如我在自己负责的章节末尾所写的那样 ， “ 另一个世界是可能达成的，但是持续50年的抗争已经向我们展现了实现这种替代愿景是多么困难 。 ”
Further progress will require determination, sustained by the faith expressed in the immortal words of the spiritual that became the hymn of the civil rights movement: “We shall overcome.”	而进一步向前迈进需要坚定的决心，并秉承着已经成为民权运动赞歌的不朽精神口号中所表达的信念 ： “ 我们一定会胜利 。 ”
	
Kerry and Europe	凯利和欧洲
Those whom the gods would destroy, they grant their wishes.	神要毁灭哪些人，就会实现他们的愿望。
Those in Europe and around the world who yearn for a victory by John Kerry in the US presidential election ought to keep that bit of ancient Greek wisdom in mind.	欧洲和全世界希望约翰·凯利在美国总统大选中获胜的人真该学学这种古希腊智慧。
During the Cold War, America was the natural leader of the Atlantic community, but the price of this leadership was that the US had to accept the autonomy and influence of its European allies.	冷战期间，美国理所当然成了大西洋地区的领袖，但代价就是不得不承认了欧洲盟国的自治，而且要尊重它们的影响。
After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, President Bush embarked on a unilateral foreign policy.	2001年9月11日发生恐怖袭击后，布什总统开始推行单边外交政策。
The traditional Atlantic alliance was replaced by what the US called "coalitions of the willing," where "the mission determines the coalition," not historic alliances.	传统上的大西洋区域联盟被美国称为"志愿者同盟"的组织所取代，这里"在联盟中起决定作用的是使命 ， " 而不再是所谓的历史联盟。
This policy divided Europe. It has also fueled deep divisions in the US presidential campaign, with one of the most potent arguments used by Kerry being that he will restore trust between America and its allies; that as president he will recruit international help in Iraq.	这项政策让欧洲四分五裂，也使美国总统大选产生了严重的分歧，凯利手中最有效的杀手锏就是恢复美国和盟友之间的信任，还有他当总统会为伊拉克问题赢得国际支援。
America undoubtedly needs more allies to bring Iraq's chaos under control and to build an Iraqi state that is seen as legitimate both by Iraqis and the world.	勿庸置疑，美国要找到更多盟友，才能控制住伊拉克的混乱局势，建起伊拉克和全世界都能接受的合法政府。
Allies are seen as an answer to America's twin credibility and legitimacy deficits in its occupation of Iraq.	盟友被人们看成美国对伊占领所造成可信性与合法性危机的唯一解决之道。
But can a Kerry-led US get a fresh start in Europe?	但凯利领导的美国真的能在欧洲重新开始吗？
Will a President Kerry really be able to rally allies to America's side?	凯利总统真的能把盟友重新召回美国的旗下？
Iraq's mayhem has hardened the antagonism of countries like France and Germany, which led the opposition to the war in the first place.	对伊拉克的伤害已经加深了法德对我们的敌意，他们最先站出来反对这场战争。
Even countries that rallied to Bush's call for help, like my homeland, Poland, are now wary of their involvement.	即使是那些响应布什号召的国家，像我的家乡波兰，现在也对自己的决定产生了怀疑。
Consider the attitudes of France and Germany.	让我们看看法德两国的态度。
Their leaders can scarcely hold their tongues, so badly do they want a Kerry victory.	他们的领袖很少保持沉默，他们迫切地希望凯利能够获胜。
But they are not going to change their policy to help Kerry win, and they won't change even if he does.	可他们不会改变政策来帮助凯利，即便他真的当选他们的政策也不会有任何改变。
As a gesture intending to boost Kerry's chances, German Defense Minister Peter Struck suggested that his country might reconsider its position on troops in Iraq.	为了替凯利创造更多机会，德国国防部长彼得·斯特拉克曾说德国有可能重新考虑自己在向伊拉克派兵问题上的立场。
But Chancellor Gerhard Schröder instantly shot down that trial balloon, declaring: "To be clear, we will send no troops to Iraq."	但格哈德·施罗德总理立刻打消了这种试探并再次郑重宣布 ： " 坦白地说，我们绝不会派兵到伊拉克 。 "
Actually, Germany, like most European countries, is politically and logistically unable to send meaningful military forces to Iraq.	实际上，德国和大多数欧洲国家一样，无论从政治还是后勤保障的角度都不可能真正向伊拉克派兵。
France, which did ponder sending 15 000 soldiers to Iraq had the UN given its blessing to the war, is as clear as Schröder.	法国倒确实考虑过如果这场战争能得到联合国的认可，它会派驻15，000名士兵，在这个问题上，法国的立场和施罗德一样明确。
According to Michel Barnier, France's Foreign Minister, "Neither today, nor tomorrow," will French troops be sent.	法国外长米歇尔•巴尼耶说 ， " 法国不仅今天不会派兵，明天也还是不会 。 "
Both countries firmly believe that military success in Iraq is impossible.	法德两国都坚信：军事成功的可能性在伊拉克近乎为零。
So will transatlantic relations remain as poisoned as they are now if Kerry wins?	那么如果凯利获胜，大西洋关系是否还会像现在一样糟糕？
Is Texas swagger merely to be replaced by the distinguished disdain of a Boston Brahmin?	凯利当选是否只是波士顿贵族取代了德克萨斯牛皮大王？
This is probably too pessimistic.	这种观点可能太悲观了。
Europe cannot give an openly negative answer to Kerry's request for help, because that would be a slap in the face to the most pro-European American likely to be elected president anytime soon.	欧洲无法公开拒绝凯利的援助请求，因为这无异于在可能很快当选美国总统的凯利脸上重重地抽上一记耳光，更何况凯利在总统候选人里与欧洲的关系最为亲密。
Such a rejection would not only put transatlantic relations even more at risk than they are today; it would also put relations between European countries in peril.	这样的公开拒绝不仅会使大西洋关系变得更加危险，而且还会危及到欧洲国家间的相互关系。
So some compromise must be found should Kerry win.	因此如果凯利当选，双方必须达成某种形式的妥协。
Fortunately, one is possible.	幸运的是，我们有个现成的方案。
The first part is purely face-saving: both parties must simply declare their good will.	首先是纯粹的"面子工程 " ： 双方都必须明确表达自己建立良好关系的意愿。
Today, European leaders are unlikely to throw even that slender lifeline to Bush.	而今天，欧洲领导人就连甩给布什这样一根救命稻草的可能性都微乎其微。
The reality behind such a declaration is that Europe would deliver low-level military and economic involvement in Iraq.	声明背后的事实是：欧洲会派少量部队进驻伊拉克，然后再象征性地给点援助。
Most European leaders understand the tiny wiggle room that Kerry will have if elected.	多数欧洲领袖对凯利当选后狭窄的活动空间心知肚明。
The near certainty that the House of Representatives will be in Republican hands, and perhaps the Senate, too, means that America's Congress will pounce on any supposed attempt by Kerry to "sell out" Bush's war.	共和党几乎肯定会在众议院选举中获胜，参议院也可能会成为他们的囊中之物，也就是说，凯利任何可能"出卖"布什战争的行为都会遭到美国国会的无情镇压。
So Kerry may put even more pressure on Europe to help out in Iraq than the unilateralist Bush ever did.	因此与奉行单边主义的布什相比，凯利可能会给欧洲施加更多的压力，以摆脱美国目前在伊拉克陷入的困境。
But there is a second, more fundamental, part to any viable compromise: a redefinition of transatlantic relations.	但在任何可行的妥协中还有另外一个更重要的部分：那就是重新塑造大西洋地区关系。
The key point here is joint recognition that a fundamental transatlantic community of values exists, and that both sides need each other.	其中的关键是双方都要认识到大西洋地区国家有着共同的基本价值观，而且双方都需要得到对方的支持。
That transatlantic community must jointly feel responsible for maintaining peace and stability in the world.	此外还有一点：大西洋地区必须对维护世界的和平与稳定负起共同的责任。
The US must accept this principle, and recognize that Europe is a partner, not merely a servant, whether willing or unwilling, of American orders.	美国必须接受这一原则，承认欧洲是自己的战略伙伴，而不能不管欧洲愿意与否，都像对待佣人那样强迫它执行命令。
If burdens are to be shared, decisions must be shared as well.	如果需要共同承担责任，那么就必须共同做出决策。
This will require that America recognize the validity of Europe's view of the Israel-Palestinian conflict as the major roadblock toward a peaceful Middle East. Europe, for its part, must not only show that it feels responsible for the world, but that it is ready and willing to act accordingly by contributing in a significant way to reconstructing Iraq.	这意味着美国要接受欧洲的看法，即以色列－巴勒斯坦冲突是中东和平最大的绊脚石，而对欧洲来讲，则需要表明它不仅愿意负起责任，还愿意采取相应的行动，为伊拉克重建做出重要的贡献。
Europe's military means may be limited, but it has important experience in peacekeeping and "state building" that can be brought to bear.	欧洲的军事能力也许有限，但它在维和及"国家建设"方面却有着丰富的经验，能够派上很大的用场。
Is Europe really ready to undertake such an effort if its wish for a Kerry victory comes true?	如果欧洲真的希望凯利获胜，那么它是否已经做好准备，要完成这样艰巨的任务？
	
Kerry vs. Bush: Will Reason Prevail?	凯利对阵布什：理性能否占据上风？
With over 1,000 US deaths in Iraq, and the huge pressures that the occupation of that benighted country has put on American troops around the world, it is clear that - for the first time in decades - foreign policy issues may determine the outcome of a US presidential election.	随着美国在伊阵亡将士超过千人，以及占领那个蒙昧国家在全球范围内给美军造成的巨大压力，非常明显¾几十年来，外交政策可能首次成为美国总统大选的决定因素。
Ordinary Americans are asking themselves the same questions that people around the world are asking: how should America's global supremacy be used?	全世界各国人民都在问的问题，现在普普通通的美国人也在问：那就是美国的全球霸权到底该如何使用？
What price must be paid for that supremacy to be maintained?	为了维持这样的霸权，到底应该付出多大的代价？
What limits on the use of US military power are acceptable or necessary?	美国军事力量的使用在何种程度上是必要和可以接受的？
These have long been dominant questions in America's strategic debate. But, after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, they became confused with another debate, one far more important for a US electorate that feels threatened: how can alliances and multilateral institutions protect Americans?	这个问题早就成了美国战略讨论的重点，但在2001年911恐怖袭击发生后，这个问题又和感觉受到威胁的美国选民心目中另外一个重要问题发生了混淆：盟国和多边机构怎样才能保护美国人的安全？
John Kerry's great virtue has been to resist confusing the demand for security and peace with the hegemonic impulses of America the hyper-power.	约翰·凯利最大的优点就是拒绝把对和平安全的需求与希望美国扮演超级大国的霸权冲动混为一谈。
Nationalist and neo-conservative currents within the Bush administration believe that unilateral action best serves US interests because it handcuffs American power the least.	布什政府中涌动的民族主义和新保守主义浪潮认为：采取单边行动最能保护美国的利益，因为它对美国的军事力量限制最小。
On this view, the security of the US can be guaranteed through energetic military action, with or without allies.	按照这种观点，不管我们有没有盟友，积极地采取军事行动都最能确保美国的安全。
Hence the Bush administration's tendency to weaken the ties of America's permanent alliances, including those that NATO represents.	紧接着就有了布什政府削弱美国永久性联盟的错误倾向，甚至连北约联盟都未能幸免。
Unilateral announcement of troop reductions in Europe and Asia, where US forces primarily serve (as in South Korea) to dissuade aggression, can only be seen as a corollary of this tendency.	单方面宣布在欧亚这些传统驻军地区的裁军计划(比如南朝鲜)来制止侵略，也只能被看成是上述趋势的必然结果。
The Bush doctrine's bedrock notion is that of "pre-emptive war," a doctrine that lacks international legitimacy and that therefore can usually count on only a limited number of allies.	布什信条的理论基础是"把握战争先机 " ， 这样的原则十分缺乏国际基础，因此能得到的支持肯定也非常有限。
The idea behind pre-emptive wars is that American force should be projected through high-tech, blitzkrieg type wars waged from US soil, or from the soil of uncritical allies.	"把握战争先机"背后的理念是：美军应该从美国本土、或不持反对意见的盟国领土发动高科技闪电战。
On this view, NATO is merely to serve as a means to mobilize Europeans to tackle the inevitable postwar stabilization and reconstruction missions - obviating the need for the US to place its forces under NATO command.	在这种情况下，北约不过是动员欧洲人负起不可推卸的战后稳定和重建责任的一种手段－美国也根本用不着把军队置于北约的领导之下。
This is what happened in Afghanistan.	阿富汗的情况就是这样。
But as NATO's Secretary General has said, if it is the mission that defines the coalition, then NATO - a permanent alliance - is no longer needed.	但正如北约秘书长所言，如果这就是北约联盟的所谓使命，那么北约－这个永久性的战略联盟－根本就没有存在的必要。
John Kerry is focused upon the same type of security problems as Bush. This leaves many observers skeptical about the possibility for real change.	约翰·凯利关注的安全问题和布什一样，这也使不少观察家怀疑他能否带来真正的变化。
Where he differs fundamentally from Bush is in his belief that resolving international problems that affect the US almost always calls for the support of others. He therefore considers the revival of America's alliances to be a key foreign policy priority, and he has proposed that US forces in Iraq should be integrated into a NATO operation, as long as this remains under US command.	但他与布什最大的不同之处就是相信解决对美国造成重大影响的国际问题几乎无一例外地需要得到别国的支持，他也因此把美国战略联盟的复兴看作是外交政策的重中之重，而且还建议在保持美国领导的前提下，把驻伊美军纳入北约联盟的控制之中。
Acting jointly means that the US will have to take into account other interests and views - views that may not always be in harmony with its own.	联合行动意味着美国将不得不考虑到别国的利益和看法－尽管这些看法不一定总能与自己保持一致。
America will have to accept a world that is regulated not by the US unilaterally, but by global institutions and permanent alliances.	美国必须接受不由美国单边控制、而由世界组织和永久性联盟管理的世界。
And the norms and rules that govern international institutions constitute a boundary on American power - and thus as a check on its hegemony.	如果这样，管理国际组织的原则和惯例就构成了美国权力的界线¾进而也就阻止了美国的霸权企图。
Kerry and a growing number of Americans recognize that accepting limits on US power and the use of military force are a precondition for America's ultimate security, that what binds can also strengthen, and that such limits will reinforce America's ability to tackle the crisis in Iraq.	凯利和越来越多的美国人都意识到：接受对美国权力和使用军事力量的限制是享受终极安全的前提条件，必要的限制同样能加强美国的力量，而这些限制将增强美国处理伊拉克危机的能力。
Kerry knows that in most cases military power alone cannot be decisive, as there are other dimensions of power - so-called "soft power" - that are essential to resolving crises and establishing peace.	凯利知道在很多情况下仅有军事实力是不够的，因为还存在其它形式的力量－那就是所谓的"软性力量 " － 这种"软性力量"在解决危机和建立和平方面发挥了关键的作用。
These dimensions include international legitimacy, values (including tolerance), and public opinion.	上述领域涵盖了国际合法性、价值观（其中也包括容忍）和公众舆论。
The coming US election recalls a famous debate described by Thucydides in his History of the Peloponnesian War, concerning how Athens should respond to the revolt of Mytilene.	即将举行的美国大选让我想起了修西得底斯在《伯罗奔尼撒战史》中所描绘的一个著名争议，讲的就是雅典人该如何对待米蒂利尼人的反抗。
The vote supported those who felt that "those who make wise decisions are more formidable to their enemies than those who rush madly into strong action."	最终的表决结果是：多数人认为"做出明智决定的人比采取疯狂行动的人更能让敌人害怕 " 。
Let us hope that reason also prevails this time round.	让我们希望这次理性同样能够占据上风。
	
Problem Solving in the Anthropocene	人类纪的问题解决
STOCKHOLM – Take a deep breath.	斯托克霍姆—深吸一口气。
Savor it for a moment.	屏住一段时间。
Now consider this: None of our modern human ancestors ever breathed anything like it – and, the way things are going, nor will our descendants.	现在，想一想：我们的现代人祖先从未呼吸过类似的空气 — — 以及体验过现在的一切，我们的后代亦是如此。
Since the Industrial Revolution began, human activity has substantially changed the atmosphere’s composition.	自工业革命开始以来，人类活动极大地改变了大气成分。
Carbon-dioxide levels are higher today than they have been in at least 800,000 years.	如今，二氧化碳水平至少比过去80万年都要高。
The amount of nitrogen and sulfur circulating through the Earth system has doubled.	进入地球循环系统的氮和硫的数量也翻了一番。
The ocean’s pH is changing at an unprecedented rate, reaching levels of acidity that marine organisms have not experienced in the last 20 million years.	海洋pH值以前所未有的速度改变着，目前的酸度是过去2000万年的海洋生物从未体验过的。
Clearly, humans – who now occupy almost 40% of the planet’s ice-free land surface – are shaping many of the planet’s fundamental processes.	显然，人类 — — 目前占领了地球无冰覆盖地表的近40 % — —正在决定许多地球的基本过程。
According to Nobel laureate Paul Crutzen, this shift is so profound that it amounts to the beginning of a new epoch: the Anthropocene.	诺贝尔奖获得者克鲁岑指出，这一变化是如此之大，足以开启一个新纪元 — — 人类纪。
While some scientists believe that the Anthropocene actually began when humans started farming and domesticating animals, others (including me) consider it to be a more recent development.	一些经济学家认为人类纪实际上从人类从事农业、驯化动物时便已开始，也有科学家（包括我）认为人类纪是更晚才发展出现的。
But, regardless of when the Anthropocene began, it is clear that humanity’s impact on the planet increased substantially after World War II’s end.	但是，不管人类纪何时开始，显然人类对地球的影响在二战以后迅速地增加了。
Indeed, around 1950, the world seems to have reached a tipping point, with practically every factor that heightens humanity’s impact on the planet – population, GDP, fertilizer use, the proliferation of telephones, and paper consumption, to name only a few – beginning to increase rapidly.	事实上，1950年前后的世界正处在引爆点，从实际而言，每一个代表人类对地球影响的因子 — — 人口、GDP、化肥使用量、电话普及度、纸张消费，以上仅仅是一些例子 — — 都开始快速增长。
During this period, which the scientist Will Steffen dubbed the “Great Acceleration,” the human population became sufficiently large and connected, with high enough consumption, to become a major global force.	在此期间 — — 科学家威尔·斯特芬（Will Steffen）称之为“大加速 ” — —人口变得众多，人际联系变得紧密，消费变得庞大，足以成为主要全球推动力。
In a 2009 study, scientists concluded that, by crossing any of nine “planetary boundaries” – climate change, biodiversity loss, disruption of nitrogen and phosphorus cycles, land use, freshwater extraction, ocean acidification, ozone depletion, atmospheric aerosol loading, and chemical pollution – humans would increase the risk of fundamentally changing the Earth system.	在一份2009年的研究中，科学家指出，九大“地球边界 ” — —气候变化、生物多样性损失、氮和磷循环的破坏、土地使用、清洁水抽取、海洋酸化、臭氧耗竭、大气悬浮微粒负载和化学污染 — — 都已被人类突破，人类也因此增加了地球系统发生根本性变化的风险。
Given that these boundaries are closely interlinked, allowing trends toward any of them to continue, especially at the current rate, would drive the environment into unknown territory, potentially causing serious damage to the systems that underpin human survival.	这些边界彼此之间联系十分紧密，因此九个方向中任何一个趋势继续维持下去，特别是以当前速度继续维持下去的话，环境将发生未可知的变化，特别是，人类赖以生存的系统可能受到严重损害。
In order to cope with the unique challenges of the Anthropocene, humans need a new approach to management and strategic decision-making.	为了应对人类纪特有的挑战，人类需要新的管理方针和战略性决策。
Developing successful strategies will require abandoning long-held assumptions that worked in the past, but that have become counterproductive myths today.	发展成功的战略需要抛弃过去一直有效、但如今已适得其反的长期假设。
One such myth is that it is best to tackle one problem at a time with straightforward, targeted solutions.	假设之一是最好以直接、定向的方案每次解决一个问题。
While this approach may be appealing, it is inadequate to address today’s most pressing issues.	这一方针看上去颇具吸引力，但并不足以解决当今最紧迫的问题。
For example, producing and delivering nutritious food consistently to upwards of nine billion people by mid-century has implications for water and energy consumption, agricultural development and land use, the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles, and ocean acidification, not to mention biodiversity loss, such as through overfishing.	比如，为到本世纪中叶将跨越九十亿门槛的全体人口不断地生产和运送有营养的食物将影响水和能源消费、农业发展和土地使用、��和磷循环以及海洋酸化，更不用说生物多样性损失了（比如过度渔业捕捞行为 ） 。
Given this, the Green Revolution’s narrow, production-focused approach cannot overcome food insecurity in the future, even though it produced truly impressive output increases in the past.	因此，绿色革命的专注于生产的狭隘方针无法克服未来食品安全问题，虽然它曾在过去带来过名符其实的产出暴增。
The world needs an innovative, comprehensive strategy aimed at optimizing the entire food system – for example, by improving fertilizer and water use and food transportation and storage; by ensuring that adequate nutrition is accessible and affordable for all; and by changing communities’ eating habits to include less resource-intensive food.	世界需要以优化整个粮食系统的创新、全面的战略 — — 比如通过改善化肥和水使用以及粮食运输和储存；或是通过确保足够的营养可以以足够低廉的价格获得；或是通过改变社会饮食习惯、将资源密集度低的食物纳入进来。
The trouble is that complexity can be overwhelming, so people often prefer to break down complex systems into individual components.	麻烦在于复杂性可能成为不可逾越的障碍，以至于人们通常想把复杂系统分解为诸个别组分。
Rather than consider, say, eradicating extreme poverty and averting global warming in tandem – and developing mutually reinforcing strategies to achieve these goals – proposed solutions focus on one or the other, undermining their effectiveness.	比如，建议方案不会考虑在根除极端贫困和扭转全球变暖两方面双管齐下 — — 并发展互相强化的战略达到这些目标 — — 而是会逐一考虑这两个问题，这就破坏了有效性。
Of course, addressing interconnected issues simultaneously carries its share of challenges.	当然，同时解决互相联系的问题需要共同分担挑战。
For one thing, no single person or group has enough knowledge or experience to solve all of the problems afflicting a complex system at once.	一方面，没有哪个个人或群体能够拥有足够的知识和专业性一次性解决影响复杂系统的所有问题。
But a wider community – including governments, businesses, researchers, philosophers, faith communities, and even poets and artists – could devise and implement holistic strategies.	但更广义的社会 — — 包括政府、企业、研究者、思想家、信仰界甚至诗人和艺术家 — — 可以设计出并实施全盘战略。
Success will depend on participants’ willingness to cooperate and their commitment to put evidence before ideology.	能否成功将取决于参与者的合作意愿以及是否能够做到将证据置于意识形态之前。
Thus, the real challenge lies in marshaling such an inclusive community – something at which global leaders have not proved adept.	因此，真正的挑战在于组织起这样一个包容性社会 — — 这是全球领袖所不擅长的。
A second major challenge is that resources are limited, making it impossible to solve all of the world’s problems at once.	第二个主要挑战是资源是有限的，这意味着不可能同时解决世界面临的所有问题。
In this context, the ability to prioritize effectively is essential.	在这样的背景下，有效地编排优先顺序至关重要。
But, rather than emphasizing one problem over another, the top priority should be building resilience into all global systems.	但是，最要紧的不是决定甲问题是否比乙问题重要，而是让所有全球系统都具有恢复力。
Mechanisms aimed at solving a problem in one system should not be allowed to compromise another system’s resilience.	旨在解决甲系统的问题的机制不能影响乙系统的恢复力。
Another challenge will be to devise new metrics to replace GDP as the leading measure of human well-being.	另一个挑战是以新的指标取代GDP作为人类福祉的主要指标。
Even Simon Kuznets, the main architect of the concept of GDP, recognized that it does not account for many of the factors affecting human well-being; he argued that it should be used “only with some qualifications.”	GDP概念的主要设计者西蒙·库兹涅茨也承认，GDP并未考虑到众多影响人类福祉的因素；他认为GDP只能在“某些场合”使用。
In the Anthropocene, GDP must be part of an array of metrics for assessing economic, natural, and social capital – that is, the value of the goods and services produced, as well as the dignity of the ecosystems and social structures that underpin this output.	进入人类纪，GDP只能作为评估经济、自然和社会资本的一系列指标中的一个，全面的指标既要表示生产出来的商品和服务的价值，也要体现作为产出基础的生态系统和社会结构的尊严。
Navigating the Anthropocene effectively and ethically is perhaps the most daunting challenge that modern humans have faced.	在效率和伦理方面在人类纪游刃有余也许是现代人类所面临的最艰巨的挑战。
Overcoming it will require a smarter approach to strategic decision-making and a broader understanding of innovation.	克服这一挑战需要更明智的战略决策方针和更广泛的对创新的理解。
It is time for us to rise to the challenge.	我们应该从现在开始应对这一挑战。
	
Stop Subsidizing Climate Change	停止补贴气候变化
LONDON – Next week, governments will gather in Warsaw, Poland, for a crucial round of climate negotiations, with both expectation and ambition running at an all-time low.	伦敦—下周，各国政府将汇聚在波兰华沙展开气候变化谈判的关键轮次，而期望和雄心都处于历史最低点。
But it does not have to be like this: The Warsaw meeting provides an opportunity to galvanize action on one of the most potent forces driving climate change – the billions of dollars spent by governments on fossil-fuel subsidies.	但本来没必要如此：华沙会议提供了一次刺激对最强力地推动气候变化的行为 — — 政府对化石燃料的数十亿美元的补贴采取行动的机会。
The Warsaw talks are a staging post on the route to the 2015 United Nations climate summit in Paris, at which governments will seek to forge an agreement that prevents dangerous climate change, defined as global warming of more than two degrees Celsius.	华沙谈判是2015年巴黎联合国气候峰会之前的预热。 在巴黎峰会上，各国政府将寻求形成防止气候变化（其定义是全球变暖超过二摄氏度）的协定。
Failure would expose future generations to catastrophic climate risks, while trapping millions of people in poverty as a result of more frequent, intense, and protracted droughts, floods, and storms.	失败将让子孙后代面临灾难性气候风险，让几百万人因为更频繁、剧烈和长期的干旱、洪水和风暴而陷入贫困。
Basic carbon arithmetic illustrates the scale of the problem.	基本碳算术说明了问题的严重性。
According to the most recent assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we are on a trajectory toward exhausting the twenty-first century’s entire carbon budget by 2030.	根据政府间气候变化委员会（IPCC）的最新评估，我们在2030年就将用完二十一世纪的全部碳预算。
So, can we head off the impending collision between the energy systems driving the global economy and our planet’s ecological limits?	那么，我们可以避免推动全球经济的能源体系和地球的生态极限之间的即将到来的碰撞吗？
The necessary innovations are emerging.	必要的创新正在显现。
Recent developments in wind, solar, tidal, bio-energy, geothermal, and fuel-cell technology are transforming the scope for low-carbon energy production.	风能、太阳能、潮汐能、生物能、地热能和燃料电池技术的最新发展正在改变低碳能源产品领域。
Aside from saving the planet, these technologies could open up new investment opportunities, deliver affordable energy, and sustain growth.	除了拯救地球，这些技术可以带来新的投资机会、可负担的能源和持续的增长。
But that potential will be realized only if governments actively pursue green industrial policies.	但要实现这一潜力，政府必须积极地追求绿色产业政策。
They need to align the goal of avoiding dangerous climate change with disincentives for carbon-intensive energy – including taxes, carbon markets, and support for green alternatives.	政府需要将避免危险的气候变化的目标与鼓励远离碳密集能源的手段（包括税收、碳市场和支持绿色替代能源）结合起来。
Fossil-fuel subsidies have the opposite effect.	化石燃料补贴效果则相反。
They actively promote carbon-intensive energy and deter green investment.	它们积极地促进了碳密集能源，阻碍了绿色投资。
According to the International Energy Agency, governments pumped $523 billion into fossil-fuel subsidies in 2011.	根据国际能源署的估计，2011年各国政府在化石燃料补贴上耗资5230亿美元。
From a climate-change perspective, this is a world turned upside down: for every $1 in support for renewable energy, another $6 promotes carbon-intensive fuels.	从气候变化角度看，这是颠倒是非：对应支持可再生能源的每1美元，促进碳密集燃料花费6美元。
Most fossil-fuel subsidies can be traced to developing countries, where they drain budgets and provide transfers to wealthy households.	大部分化石燃料补贴可以追溯到发展中国家，这是在康预算之慨向富裕家庭转移支付。
But rich countries operate their own subsidies, which average $7 for every ton of CO2 they emit.	但富国也有补贴，排放的每一吨二氧化碳中平均包含7美元补贴。
Research by the United Kingdom’s Overseas Development Institute that examined tax and consumer subsidies provided by governments in 11 OECD countries found support equivalent to $72 billion, or around $112 per adult.	英国海外发展研究所的研究考察了11个经合组织国家政府的税收和消费者补贴，结果发现化石燃料支持合720亿美元，或每个成年人112美元。
It is difficult to think of a more irresponsible use of public money.	很难想象还有比这更不负责任的公共资金支出。
The inconsistencies between climate goals and energy policies are becoming increasingly stark.	气候目标和能源政策之间的不一致正变得越来越尖锐。
Germany is providing lavish support for the construction of new coal plants.	德国为新建煤电站提供慷慨的支持。
Britain offers generous tax concessions for oil and gas exploration, including bumper deals for companies involved in fracking.	英国为油气勘探提供慷慨的免税待遇，包括针对液压致裂法有关公司的巨大好处。
The United States spends heavily to subsidize gasoline and other fossil fuels.	美国花巨资补贴汽油和其他化石燃料。
In all of these cases, bold climate-change targets are being undermined by business-as-usual subsidies.	在所有这些例子中，大胆的气候变化目标因为老方一帖的补贴政策而遭到破坏。
Carbon markets could provide a corrective to fossil-fuel subsidies, but they are not doing so.	碳市场可以提供正确的化石燃料补贴，但它们没有这样做。
The European Union claims the mantle of global leadership on climate change, yet its leaders have allowed the price of carbon in the EU’s Emissions Trading Scheme to collapse, owing to reckless over-supply of carbon credits.	欧盟号称是全球气候变化领头羊，但其领导人放任欧盟碳排交易机制（Emissions Trading Scheme）碳定价因为鲁莽的碳信用过度供给而崩溃。
By contrast, South Korea has signaled that it will enforce a greenhouse-gas cap that is projected to push prices to 20 times the EU level by 2017 – and green-energy investment there is booming.	相反，韩国释放的信号表明它将强化温室气体上限，预计到2017年将碳排价格推高到欧盟水平的20倍，而韩国的绿色能源投资也迎来了繁荣。
With energy prices moving center stage, there is a danger that already-weak incentives for investment in low-carbon energy will be further undermined.	随着能源价格成为核心问题，已然十分脆弱的低碳能源投资激励有可能被进一步削弱。
Across Europe, calls for “affordable energy” are fast becoming a euphemism for increased fossil-fuel subsidies and a rollback of commitments on green energy.	放眼欧洲，对“可负担能源”的吁求正在快速变为增加化石燃料补贴、收回绿色能源承诺的委婉说法。
Recent debates in the UK illustrate the emerging fault lines.	最近在英国发生的争论表明裂痕正在产生。
Five years ago, Britain broke the international mold by enacting legislation mandating an 80% cut in greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050.	五年前，英国打破国际常规，立法要求到2050年削减80%的温室气体排放量。
Today, political leaders openly attack “burdensome” green taxes.	如今，政治领袖公开攻讦“不堪重负”的绿色税。
The government has delayed setting a decarbonization target for electricity generation, there is uncertainty over pricing for green energy sources, and the Green Investment Bank is under-financed.	政府推迟了电力去碳化目标的设定，绿色能源资源的定价充满了不确定性，而绿色投资银行（Green Investment Bank）也处于资金不足状态。
Unsurprisingly, investment in renewable energy has fallen to a four-year low.	毫不奇怪，可再生能源投资降至四年新低。
Expecting the Warsaw climate negotiations to deliver a major breakthrough would be a triumph of hope over evidence.	期待华沙气候谈判产生重大突破只是没有证据的空想。
Yet the talks provide a platform for practical action – and for governments to demonstrate leadership by example.	但谈判提供了一个实践平台，也提供了政府用榜样证明领导力的平台。
The G-20 countries, which have already agreed, in principle, to phase out fossil-fuel subsidies, should seize the moment.	G-20国家已经在原则上同意逐步取消化石燃料补贴，它们应该抓住这个机会。
They could hold a “side-summit” in Warsaw at which they set a schedule for translating principle into practice.	它们可以在华沙举办一个“方面峰会 ” ， 为将原则落实为政策设定时间表。
The target should be full elimination of all fossil-fuel subsidies by 2020.	目标应该是到2020年全部取消化石燃料补贴。
Rich G-20 countries could go further and faster.	G-20富国可以走得更快更远。
They should pledge to eliminate all subsidies by the time they arrive at the UN’s COP 21 climate-change summit in Paris in 2015, starting next year with the withdrawal of all support for gasoline and for coal, oil, and gas exploration.	它们应该承诺在2015年出席联合国COP 21气候变化峰会前取消所有化石燃料补贴，从明年开始取消所有对汽油和煤炭、石油和天然气勘探的支持。
And they should divert part of the savings into energy cooperation aimed at supporting low-carbon transitions in developing countries.	它们还应该将部分储蓄用于旨在支持发展中国家低碳转型的能源合作。
Eliminating fossil-fuel subsidies would be just one small step on the road to a global climate agreement.	取消化石燃料补贴将只是通往全球气候协定道路上的一小步。
But it would at least be a step in the right direction – and it might just restore confidence in a negotiating process that is slowly going nowhere.	但这至少是朝正确方向的一步 — — 或许能够为缓缓滑向僵局的谈判进程树立信心。
	
Keynes and Social Democracy Today	凯恩斯和今天的社会民主
LONDON – For decades, Keynesianism was associated with social democratic big-government policies.	
But John Maynard Keynes’s relationship with social democracy is complex. Although he was an architect of core components of social democratic policy – particularly its emphasis on maintaining full employment – he did not subscribe to other key social democratic objectives, such as public ownership or massive expansion of the welfare state.	伦敦 — —
In The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, Keynes ends by summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of the capitalist system.	数十年以来，凯恩斯主义都和社会民主的大政府主义政策相关联。
On one hand, capitalism offers the best safeguard of individual freedom, choice, and entrepreneurial initiative.	但其实凯恩斯和其关系比较复杂。
On the other hand, unregulated markets fail to achieve two central goals of any civilized society: “The outstanding faults of the economic society in which we live are its failure to provide for full employment and its arbitrary and inequitable distribution of wealth and incomes.” This suggested an active role for government, which dovetailed with important strands of left-wing thought.	虽然他是社会民主政策核心价值观的设计师 — — 特别是侧重于充分就业方面而言 — — 但他和社会民主的其他政策，例如公有制或福利国家的无限延伸等却并不想关。
Until The General Theory was published in 1936, social democrats did not know how to go about achieving full employment.	在《就业、利息和货币通论》一书中，凯恩斯以资本主义的优劣评判作为结束语。 一方面，资本主义给了个人自由，选择和创新精神以最好的保护。
Their policies were directed at depriving capitalists of the ownership of the means of production.	另一方面，无监管的市场无法实现文明社会的两个中心目标 ： “ 经济社会的致命错误在于无法提供充分的就业以及保证社会财富收入分配的公平性 。 ”
How this was to produce full employment was never worked out.	这就凸显出政府在其中的重要性，这也是左派思想的重要观点。
There was an idea, originally derived from Ricardo and Marx, that the capitalist class needed a “reserve army of the unemployed” to maintain its profit share.	在1936年《通论》一书发表之前，社会民主人士并不清楚如何实现就业的充分性。
If profits were eliminated, the need for that reserve army would disappear.	他们只是侧重于剥夺资本家对生产资料的所有权。
Labor would be paid what it was worth, and everyone willing to work would be able to find a job.	对如何实现充分的就业一无所知。
But, apart from the political impossibility of nationalizing the whole economy peacefully, this approach suffered from the fatal flaw of ignoring the role of aggregate demand.	这种理论起源于李嘉图和马克思的思想，所谓资产阶级需要保持“一定数量的失业大军”来维持其利润。 如果消灭了利润，失业大军也没有存在的必要了。
It assumed that demand would always be sufficient if profits were eliminated.	劳动者就会获取应得的报酬，任何想要工作的人都能找到工作。
Keynes demonstrated that the main cause of bouts of heavy and prolonged unemployment was not worker encroachment on profits, but the fluctuating prospects of private investment in an uncertain world.	但是，想用政治的手段和平地实现整个社会财富的公有化几乎不可能，这种方法致命的缺陷在于忽略了人类不断提升的需求。
Nearly all unemployment in a cyclical downturn was the result of the failure of investment demand.	其假设的前提是如果消灭利润，需求一直维持充足。
Thus, the important thing was not to nationalize the capital stock, but to socialize investment. Industry could be safely left in private hands, provided the state guaranteed enough spending power in the economy to maintain a full-employment level of investment.	凯恩斯告诉我们，严重失业现象产生的原因不是劳工受到资本家的剥削，而是在未知世界中的私人投资不确定的投资前景。
This could be achieved by monetary and fiscal policy: low interest rates and large state investment programs.	几乎所有的失业起源于经济萧条周期中的投资需求低迷。
In short, Keynes aimed to achieve a key social democratic objective without changing the ownership of industry.	那么，我们要做的不是将生产资料国有化，而是投资收益的社会化。
Nevertheless, he did think that redistribution would help secure full employment. A greater tendency to consume would “serve to increase at the same time the inducement to invest.”	私人运营不是错误的源泉，如果再加上政府担保足够的支出，就能保证充分的就业。
And the low interest rates needed to maintain full employment would lead in time to the “euthanasia of the rentier” – of those who live off the rents of capital.	这可以通过财政金融政策手段来加以实现：调低利率和加大政府投资。
Moderate re-distribution was the more politically radical implication of Keynes’s economic theory, but the measures outlined above were also the limits of state intervention for him.	简而言之，凯恩斯在没有改变所有权的前提下，实现了社会民主人士的核心目标。 而且他认为，财富的再分配确实能保证充分的就业。
	消费需求的提升可以同时刺激投资者意愿。
As long as “the state is able to determine the aggregate amount of resources devoted to augmenting the instruments [i.e., the capital base] and the basic reward to those who own them,” there is no “obvious case” for further involvement.	同时，低利率环境下的充分就业可以消灭食利阶层 — — 那些靠利息和租金来存活的人。 适度的财富再分配是凯恩斯经济学理论较为激进的政治理念，但政府的干预也应有一定的限度。
The public was never to substitute for the private, but merely to complement it.	只要“增加的财富是用于改良生产工具，劳动者能得到基本的回报 ” ， 政府就不应该干预。 公有不能替代私有，只能作为补充。
Today, ideas about full employment and equality remain at the heart of social democracy.	今天，关于充分就业和平等的理念一直是社会民主的核心。
But the political struggle needs to be conducted along new battle lines.	但政治斗争的方式已经呈现出了新形态。
Whereas the front used to run between government and the owners of the means of production – the industrialists, the rentiers – now, it runs between governments and finance.	政府和生产资料所有者（实业家和剥削者）之争已经演变为政府和金融之争。
Such measures as the efforts by the European Parliament to regulate the derivatives market or the British government’s ban on short selling in the wake of the financial crisis or the demand to caps bankers’ bonuses are contemporary expressions of the wish to reduce the power of financial speculation to damage the economy.	不论欧洲议会对衍生品市场的监管措施，英国政府在金融危机时禁止卖空的措施，或是对银行家的奖金设置上限，这些都是减少金融投机客破坏经济的现代翻版。
The new focus on the need to tame the power of finance is largely a consequence of globalization.	全球化的结果导致我们要限制金融的权力。
Capital moves across borders more freely and more quickly than goods or people do.	资本比货物人力更易于流动。
Yet, while large global firms habitually use their high concentration of financial resources to press for further de-regulation (“or we will go somewhere else”), the crisis has turned their size into a liability.	然而，跨国公司更习惯于运用其巨大的金融资源来给政府施压，要求放松管制（否则他们就抽走资本 ） ， 这场危机后果导致规模越大的公司损失越大。
Being too big to fail simply means being too big.	大而不倒就说明太大了。
Keynes saw that “it is the financial markets’ precariousness which creates no small part of our contemporary problem of securing sufficient investment.”	凯恩斯认为“金融市场”不稳定造成了我们当今不算小的问题 。 ”
That rings truer today – more than 70 years later – than in his own day. Rather than securing investment for productive sectors of the economy, the financial industry has become adept at securing investment in itself.	这样的警钟70多年之后依旧有效，如今的金融行业不是为了保障投资者的权益，而是为了自身的权利。
This, once again, calls for an activist government policy.	在这里，我们再一次呼吁政府的积极干预。
Yet, as Keynes would have argued, it is important that the expansion of government involvement is informed by sound economics rather than political ideology, social democratic or otherwise.	然而，凯恩斯认为，政府的干预应由基于成熟的经济经济学，而不是意识形态，社会民主或是其他什么。
State intervention needs to bridge gaps that the private sector cannot reasonably be expected to do on its own.	国家干预用来弥补私人企业非理性行为所导致的缺陷。
The current crisis has shown with utmost clarity that private markets are unable to self-regulate; domestic regulation is therefore a key area in which government has a role to play.	目前的危机非常清楚地表明，市场无法自我监管；政府对本国监管非常重要。
Similarly, time-inconsistency issues prevent large international firms from compartmentalizing their markets. Re-erecting barriers to capital flows in the form of international taxes, thereby cordoning off crises before they turn global, is therefore another task for government.	同样，时间不一致性问题防止跨国机构操纵市场，征收国际税可以重新对资本流动限制，在危机蔓延到全球之前加以控制，这也是政府应该做的一件事情。
Keynes’s main contribution to social democracy, however, does not lie in the specifics of policy, but in his insistence that the state as ultimate protector of the public good has a duty to supplement and regulate market forces.	然而，凯恩斯对社会民主最大的贡献不在于具体的政策，而是他坚持认为，国家作为公共产品的最终保护者，有着监管和补充市场的责任。
If we need markets to stop the state from behaving badly, we need the state to stop markets from behaving badly.	如果我们需要市场来阻止国家做恶，我们同样需要国家来阻止市场作恶。
Nowadays, that means stopping financial markets from behaving badly.	如今，也就是阻止金融市场来作恶。
That means limiting their power, and their profits.	即限制其权力和利润。
	
Keynes’s General Theory at 80	凯恩斯《通论》80周年
LONDON – In 1935, John Maynard Keynes wrote to George Bernard Shaw: “I believe myself to be writing a book on economic theory which will largely revolutionize – not, I suppose, at once but in the course of the next ten years – the way the world thinks about its economic problems.”	伦敦—1935年，凯恩斯给萧伯纳写信说 ： “ 我在写一本经济理论的书，我自信它将掀起一场世界看待经济问题的大革命 — — 不是立刻，而是在十年后 。 ”
And, indeed, Keynes’s magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, published in February 1936, transformed economics and economic policymaking.	确实，1936年2月出版的凯恩斯的名著《就业、利息和货币通论》改变了经济学和经济决策。
Eighty years later, does Keynes’s theory still hold up?	八十年后，凯恩斯的理论仍然成立吗？
Two elements of Keynes’s legacy seem secure.	凯恩斯的遗产中有两个要素地位稳固。
First, Keynes invented macroeconomics – the theory of output as a whole.	首先，凯恩斯发明了宏观经济学 — — 关于作为整体的产出的理论。
He called his theory “general” to distinguish it from the pre-Keynesian theory, which assumed a unique level of output – full employment.	他将他的理论称为“通论 ” ， 以区别于凯恩斯之前的理论。 此前的理论假设一个独特的产出水平 — — 充分就业。
In showing how economics could remain stuck in an “underemployment” equilibrium, Keynes challenged the central idea of the orthodox economics of his day: that markets for all commodities, including labor, are simultaneously cleared by prices.	凯恩斯证明了经济可能陷入“就业不足”均衡，从而挑战了当时正统经济学的中心思想：所有商品，包括劳动力在内的市场通过价格同时实现出清。
And his challenge implied a new dimension to policymaking: Governments may need to run deficits to maintain full employment.	他的挑战产生了全新的决策维度：政府可能需要用赤字来维持充分就业。
The aggregate equations that underpin Keynes’s “general theory” still populate economics textbooks and shape macroeconomic policy.	作为凯恩斯“通论”基础的总量方程仍然充斥着经济学教科书，影响着宏观经济政策。
Even those who insist that market economies gravitate toward full employment are forced to argue their case within the framework that Keynes created.	即使那些坚持市场经济自动趋向充分就业的人也被迫在凯恩斯所建立的框架中为自己辩护。
Central bankers adjust interest rates to secure a balance between total demand and supply, because, thanks to Keynes, it is known that equilibrium might not occur automatically.	中央银行调整利率以保证总需求和供给的平衡，因为，拜凯恩斯所赐，人们知道均衡不会自动发生。
Keynes’s second major legacy is the notion that governments can and should prevent depressions.	凯恩斯的第二大遗产是政府可以也应该阻止萧条的概念。
Widespread acceptance of this view can be seen in the difference between the strong policy response to the collapse of 2008-2009 and the passive reaction to the Great Depression of 1929-1932.	这一观点被广泛接受，2008—2009年崩溃引起了强力政策应对措施，而对于1929—1932年大萧条政府只是消极反应。
As the Nobel laureate Robert Lucas, an opponent of Keynes, admitted in 2008: “I guess everyone is a Keynesian in a foxhole.”	诺贝尔奖获得者、凯恩斯的反对者罗伯特·卢卡斯（Robert Lucas）在2008年承认 ： “ 我猜每个人都是隐藏很深的凯恩斯主义者 。 ”
Having said this, Keynes’s theory of “underemployment” equilibrium is no longer accepted by most economists and policymakers.	话虽如此，凯恩斯“就业不足”均衡理论已不再被大部分经济学家和决策者所接受。
The global financial crisis of 2008 bears this out.	2008年全球金融危机证明了这一点。
The collapse discredited the more extreme version of the optimally self-adjusting economy; but it did not restore the prestige of the Keynesian approach.	这场崩盘让更加极端的自我调整经济最优论信誉扫地，但也没有重塑凯恩斯观点的声望。
To be sure, Keynesian measures halted the global economy’s downward slide.	诚然，凯恩斯主义措施阻止了全球经济雪崩。
But they also saddled governments with large deficits, which soon came to be viewed as an obstacle to recovery – the opposite of what Keynes taught.	但也让政府背上了巨大的赤字，很快这就被视为复苏的障碍 — — 这与凯恩斯的教义背道而驰。
With unemployment still high, governments returned to pre-Keynesian orthodoxy, cutting spending to reduce their deficits – and undercutting economic recovery in the process.	在失业率仍然高企的情况下，政府回归前凯恩斯时代的正统，削减支出以降低赤字 — — 也在此过程中扼杀了经济复苏。
There are three main reasons for this regression.	这一倒退主要原因有三。
First, the belief in the labor-market-clearing power of prices in a capitalist economy was never wholly overturned.	首先，在资本主义经济中，对价格的劳动力市场出清力的信念从未被完全颠覆。
So most economists came to view persistent unemployment as an extraordinary circumstance that arises only when things go terribly wrong, certainly not the normal state of market economies. The rejection of Keynes’ notion of radical uncertainty lay at the heart of this reversion to pre-Keynesian thinking.	因此，大部分经济学家将持续失业视为反常情况，只有在存在大问题时才会出现，绝非市场经济的常态。
Second, post-war Keynesian “demand-management” policies, credited with having produced the long post-1945 boom, ran into inflationary trouble at the end of the 1960s.	其次，战后凯恩斯主义“需求管理”政策因为带来了1945年后的长时间繁荣而声名大振，但在20世纪60年代末陷入了通胀危机。
Alert to a worsening tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, Keynesian policymakers tried to sustain the boom through incomes policy – controlling wage costs by concluding national agreements with trade unions.	受日益恶化的通胀和失业权衡的警示，凯恩斯主义决策者试图通过收入政策维持繁荣 — — 通过国家与工会的协议控制工资成本。
Income policy was tried in many countries from the 1960s to the end of the 1970s.	20世纪60年代至70年代末，许多国家尝试了收入政策。
At best, there were temporary successes, but the policies always broke down.	它们充其量只是起到了暂时的效果，最后无一例外地失败了。
Milton Friedman provided a reason that jibed with growing disenchantment with wage and price controls, and that reasserted the pre-Keynesian view of how market economies work.	米尔顿·弗里德曼（Milton Friedman）解释了为何工资和价格控��日渐走下神坛，以及前凯恩斯时代的市场经济运行观点重新得势。
Inflation, Friedman said, resulted from attempts by Keynesian governments to force down unemployment below its “natural” rate.	弗里德曼说，凯恩斯主义政府迫使失业下降到“自然”率之下导致了通货膨胀。
The key to regaining stable prices was to abandon the full-employment commitment, emasculate the trade unions, and deregulate the financial system.	重新实现价格稳定的关键是抛弃充分就业承诺，削弱工会，减少对金融体系的监管。
And so the old orthodoxy was reborn.	旧正统由此重生。
The full-employment target was replaced by an inflation target, and unemployment was left to find its “natural” rate, whatever that was.	充分就业目标被通胀目标取代，失业被放任寻找其“自然”率（不论为何 ） 。
It was with this defective navigational equipment that politicians sailed full steam ahead into the icebergs of 2008.	政客们就是凭借这一有缺陷的导航设备开足马力撞上了2008年的冰山。
The final reason for Keynesianism’s fall from grace was the rightward ideological shift that began with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and US President Ronald Reagan.	凯恩斯主义失势的最后一个原因是始于英国首相撒切尔夫人和美国总统里根的意识形态右倾。
The shift was due less to rejection of Keynesian policy than to hostility toward the enlarged state that emerged after World War II.	这一转变与其说是因为拒绝凯恩斯政策，不如说是因为对二战后出现的国家扩大的不满。
Keynesian fiscal policy was caught in the crossfire, with many on the right condemning it as a manifestation of “excessive” government intervention in the economy.	凯恩斯主义财政政策成为众矢之的，许多右翼人士抨击它代表政府对经济的“过度”干预。
Two final reflections suggest a renewed, if more modest, role for Keynesian economics.	两个最后的沉思暗示了凯恩斯主义的一个新生的、更加现代的角色。
An even bigger shock to the pre-2008 orthodoxy than the collapse itself was the revelation of the corrupt power of the financial system and the extent to which post-crash governments had allowed their policies to be scripted by the bankers.	对2008年前正统的一个更大的冲击（比2008年崩溃还要大）是金融体系的腐败权力被曝光，人们看到崩溃后的政府是如何放任政策被银行家把持的。
To control financial markets in the interests of full employment and social justice lies squarely in the Keynesian tradition.	为了充分就业和社会正义控制金融市场是凯恩斯主义的明确传统。
Second, for new generations of students, Keynes’s relevance may lie less in his specific remedies for unemployment than in his criticism of his profession for modeling on the basis of unreal assumptions.	其次，对新一代学生来说，凯恩斯的重要性与其说在于他所提出的针对失业的具体办法，不如说在于他对经济学所提出的批评 — — 基于不现实的假设建立模型。
Students of economics eager to escape from the skeletal world of optimizing agents into one of fully-rounded humans, set in their histories, cultures, and institutions will find Keynes’s economics inherently sympathetic.	经济学学生急切地渴望杯托优化行为人的抽象世界，进入丰满的人类世界，考虑历史、文化和制度，他们将发现凯恩斯经济学具有内在的共鸣。
That is why I expect Keynes to be a living presence 20 years from now, on the centenary of the General Theory, and well beyond.	正因如此，我认为，直到20年后通论100周年及其后相当长一段时间，凯恩斯主义都将是活跃的存在。
	
Keynes versus the Classics: Round Two	凯恩斯主义对经典主义：第二轮
LONDON – The economist John Maynard Keynes wrote The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money (1936) to “bring to an issue the deep divergences of opinion between fellow economists which have for the time being almost destroyed the practical influence of economic theory…” Seventy years later, heavyweight economists are still at each other’s throats, in terms almost unchanged from the 1930’s.	伦敦 — —
The latest slugfest features New Keynesian champion Paul Krugman of Princeton University and New Classical champion John Cochrane of the University of Chicago. Krugman recently published a newspaper article entitled “How Did Economists Get It So Wrong?”	经济学家凯恩斯在《就业，投资和金钱的基本理论 》 （ 1936年版）一书中写道 ： “ 长期以来一直存在的经济学家在观点上的壁垒鲜明的对立几乎摧毁了经济理论对现实的影响力 。 。 。 ”
There was nothing in mainstream economics, Krugman wrote, “suggesting the possibility of the kind of collapse that happened last year.”	70年后的今天，各派重量级的经济学家相互之间依然争斗得你死我活，这和1930年代几乎没什么两样。
The reason was that “economists, as a group, mistook beauty, clad in impressive-looking math, for truth.” They purveyed an “idealized vision of an economy in which rational individuals interact in perfect markets.”	打得最为激烈的两派代表人物如下：一方是新凯恩斯主义的领军人，普林斯顿大学的保罗·克鲁格曼，一方是新古典主义的首领，芝加哥大学的约翰·科克伦。
Unfortunately “this sanitized vision of the economy led most economists to ignore all the things that could go wrong.”	克鲁格曼近期在报纸上发表了标题为《经济学家这么错得如此离谱？
So now economists will have to accept “the importance of irrational and often unpredictable behavior, face up to the often idiosyncratic imperfections of markets and accept that an elegant economic ‘theory of everything’ is a long way off.”	》一文。 “在主流经济学中没有这样的说法 ” ， 克鲁格曼写道 ： “ 可以推论出去年那场经济大崩盘会爆发的可能性 。 ”
Krugman’s heavy pounding of Chicago School economics goaded Cochrane, a professor of finance, into some bad-tempered counter-punching on the university’s Web site, much of which consisted of a personal attack on Krugman’s scientific integrity.	原因在于 ： “ 经济学家，成为了这么一种团体，他们用具有迷惑力的数学来包装自己，给我们一个美丽的错觉，让我们看不清事情的本质 。 ” 同时，他们提供一个“理想化的经济模型，即市场是完美的，每个参与者都是理性的 。 ”
When he gets around to economics, Cochrane aims his blows at two points: Krugman’s attack on the “efficient market theory” and his advocacy of “fiscal stimulus” for depressed economies.	“不幸的是 ” ， 这种经过简单化的经济模式使得我们绝大多数经济学家忽视了一些要素，从而导致他们出错 。 ” 于是，现在的经济学家将会不得不知晓“非理性行为，经常发生的不可预测行为的重要性。
	明白市场常常是带有某种不完美性，他们开始承认没有一种所谓放之四海皆有效的经济理论 。 ”
Cochrane accuses Krugman of misleading his readers about the efficient market theory, which asserts that, given the available information, financial markets always get asset prices right.	克鲁格曼不断抨击芝加哥学派的经济学家“愤怒”的科克伦，科克伦是经济学教授，他在自己任教大学网站上不断地对克鲁格曼提出挑战，甚至质疑他的学术操守。
Rather than defend that theory, Cochrane admits that “asset prices move more than reasonable expectations of future cash flows.” Unfortunately, “no theory is particularly good at that right now.”	在经济学领域方面，科克伦主要攻击两点：克鲁格曼对“有效市场理论”的抨击，以及他大力提倡的在经济萧条时期的政府“财政刺激”方案。
But it’s theoretical nihilism, Cochrane argues, to ascribe these excessive fluctuations to “irrationality” as Krugman does.	科克伦指责克鲁格曼在有效市场理论的问题上误导读者。
What Krugman is really after (“though he can’t quite come out and say this”) is for the government to “take charge of the allocation of capital.”	所谓有效市场理论是指，在信息充分的前提下，金融市场中订出的资产价格一向是合理的。
And the one thing we do know is that however badly asset markets behave, government control “has always been much worse.”	科克伦并没有为这个理论辩护，他承认“资产价格比未来预期的合理现金流走得要远 ” 。 不幸的是 ， “ 目前并没有特别好的理论出现 。 ”
Cochrane’s heaviest punching is reserved for Krugman’s support for President Barack Obama’s fiscal stimulus.	但科克伦也指出，这也是一种理论的虚无主义，不能将所有这些价格过度波动都归咎于克鲁格曼所认为的“非理性 ” 。
He invokes the hoary old “Ricardian equivalence theorem,” revived by the Harvard economist Robert Barro, according to whom “debt-financed spending can’t have any effect, because people, seeing the higher future taxes that must pay off the debt, will simply save more.	克鲁格曼真正的目的（当然他不能明着说）是让政府“接管所有的资本 ” 。
They will buy the new government debt and leave all spending decisions unaltered.”	但有一件事情我们是清楚的，那就是虽然资产市场表现糟糕，但政府的接管只能会把问题弄得更糟。
In short, Krugman “has absolutely no idea about what caused the crash, what policies might have prevented it, and what policies we should adopt going forward” – except that the government should now spend money like a drunken sailor.	最令科克伦所诟病的是克鲁格曼对奥巴马总统所采取财政刺激方案的支持。 他引用由哈佛经济学家罗伯特·巴罗翻出来的过时的“李嘉图的等价定理”来说明 ， “ 负债救助不会生效，因为人们会预期到现在政府债务会导致未来的税收增加，于是他们就不会存钱。
Far from having too much math, economists need more, in order to “keep the logic straight.”	反而会购买政府新发行的债券，从而使得政府的救助政策失灵 。 ”
On the stimulus, though, Krugman achieves a knock-out punch. The view that extra government spending “crowds out” an equal amount of private spending, so that its net stimulus effect is zero, would be true only if the economy were at full employment.	简而言之，克鲁格曼在“经济崩盘的原因，如何防止危机再次发生，以及我们在此问题上能吸取什么教训”等问题上，没有任何贡献。
Indeed, the Chicago School tacitly assumes that economies are always at full employment.	— — 除了政府应该不断地花钱以外，就像一��醉酒的水手行为没什么两样。
They are unfazed by the fact that America’s economy has shrunk by 4% in the last year and that over 6 million people have been added to the unemployment rolls.	对经济学家来说，目前的数学模型不是太多，而是需要更多才能使得“问题的解决更加有逻辑性 ” 。
To Chicago economists, an increase in the number of idle workers represents a voluntary choice for leisure.	在经济刺激问题上，克鲁格曼获得了全胜。
In a concession to commonsense, they concede that people may make mistakes and, to that extent, a stimulus may be beneficial.	有一种观点认为，政府的救助资金会排挤私人投资，救助的效果为零。 不过这种理论假设的前提条件是就业情况十分充分。
But they insist that the only stimulus that will work is printing money.	实际上，芝加哥学派理论狡猾地将假设的前提设定为就业一直是保持良好的。
This will drive down interest rates and lead to an economic rebound.	而去年美国经济下滑了4 % ， 600万人因此而失业，对于如此现状，他们却装作没看到。
Against this view, Keynes pointed out that interest-rate reductions may not do the job, because at zero or near-zero rates investors hoard cash rather than lend it out.	对于芝加哥学派的经济学家来说，失业率的上升代表人们自愿选择休假。
Hence, as he put it in 1932, there may be “no escape from prolonged and perhaps interminable depression except by direct state intervention to promote and subsidize new investment” – which is what the Obama administration is rightly doing.	如果基于这种判断，那么政府的经济救助无异于错误地鼓励人们休假。 他们认为唯一有效的方法就是多印钞票，这会降低利率，经济从而得以复苏。
On the question of what caused the crash, the debate is more even.	在谈到是什么导致市场崩盘这个问题上，双方打了个平手。
Krugman is hampered by the fact that he attributes the crash to “irrationality,” which, as Cochrane points out, is no theory.	克鲁格曼认为“非理性”是元凶。 而科克伦认为根本就没什么理论。
This is because Krugman refuses to take seriously Keynes’s crucial distinction between risk and uncertainty.	按照凯恩斯的说法，风险和不确定性有着严格的界限。
In my view, Keynes’s major contribution to economic theory was to emphasize the “extreme precariousness of the basis of knowledge on which our estimates of prospective yield have to be made.”	而这也正是克鲁格曼不愿意承认的事情。 在我看来，凯恩斯对于经济学最大的贡献在于，强调了“我们所能考虑到的各种极端的偶然情况 。 ”
The fact of their ignorance forces investors to fall back on certain conventions, of which the most important are that the present will continue into the future, that existing share prices sum up future prospects, and that if most people believe something, they must be right.	投资者往往有盲点，但最为重要的事情是对未来的预期，从现在的股价推算出未来的上升空间，如果绝大多数人都这么认为的话，他们就是对的。
This makes for considerable stability in markets as long as the conventions hold .	只要这种势头一直如此，市场就会一直保持相对的稳定。
But they are liable to being overturned suddenly in the face of passing bad news, because “there is no firm basis of conviction to hold them steady.”	一旦坏消息传播开来，上述情况就会突然完全转变。 因为“没有足够坚实的基础能保证市场的稳定 。 ”
It’s like what happens in a crowded theater if someone shouts “Fire!”	就像在一个拥挤的剧场中，突然有人大喊一声“着火了 ！ ”
Everyone rushes to get out.	每个人都想要逃生。
This is not “irrational” behavior.	这并不是“非理性的”行为。
It is reasonable behavior in the face of uncertainty.	而是面对不确定性的一种理性行为。
In essence, this is what happened last autumn.	从本质上来说，去年秋天所发生事情就是这样。
Chicago School economics has never been more vulnerable than it is today – and deservedly so.	芝加哥学派的经济学理论从来就没有这么不堪一击 — — 他们确实也应该这样。
But the attack on it will never succeed unless policy Keynesians like Krugman are willing to work out the implications of irreducible uncertainty for economic theory.	如果克鲁格曼只是攻击他们，当然也不会得到人们的认可，除非他能提出自己在经济学领域中 对于不确定性作出的自己独到见解。
	
The Keys to Universal Health Coverage	全民健康覆盖的关键
DAR ES SALAAM – It has been three years since world leaders committed to one of the boldest goals ever set in global public health: achieving universal health coverage by 2030.	达累斯萨拉姆—三年前，世界领导人做出了全球公共卫生史上最宏大之一的目标承诺：到2030年实现全民健康覆盖。
Achieving this objective will mean that every person in every community has access to affordable care, both to prevent them from falling ill and to treat them when they do.	实现这一目标将意味着所有社区的每一个人都能获得平价医疗，不管是预防疾病还是疾病治疗。
The stakes are simply too high not to deliver on this promise.	如果不能兑现这一承诺，代价将极其昂贵。
We cannot eradicate poverty, protect people from pandemics, advance gender equality, or achieve any of the other 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) without accelerating progress toward universal health coverage.	如果我们不加快全民健康覆盖不乏，就无法消除贫困，无法保护人民不患传染病，无法推动性别平等，无法实现其他所有2030年可持续发展目标（SDG ） 。
Fortunately, national leaders are starting to take concrete steps toward expanding access to health care.	幸运的是，国家领导人也开始采取切实措施扩大医疗普及。
As I, along with many others, have come to realize, success depends on first overcoming one of the most significant challenges in health: overly fragmented approaches to delivering care.	我和其他许多人意识到，成功首先要求克服最重大的健康挑战之一：实现医疗的方针过于碎片化。
Instead of treating one disease at a time, we need to establish systems in which people’s diverse health needs are treated side by side.	我们需要的不是一次治好一种病，而需要建立人民多样化的健康需求能得到一一满足的体系。
Every woman should be able to turn to a trusted provider in her community to receive family planning services for herself, routine immunizations for her children, or diabetes treatments for an aging relative.	每一名妇女都应该能够求助受信任的社区卫生服务提供者获得生育规划、幼儿常规免疫以及老年亲属的糖尿病治疗。
The best way for countries to achieve a more integrated approach is to strengthen primary care, which is most people’s first point of contact with the health system.	各国实现更为一体化的方针的最佳办法是强化初级医疗。 初级医疗是大部分人与卫生体系打交道的起点。
Primary-care providers can address more than 80% of health needs.	初级医疗提供者可以解决80%以上的健康需要。
And because primary care is delivered to rich and poor alike, it is the foundation of a fair and equitable society.	而由于初级医疗不论穷富都能获得，因此它也是公正平等的社会的基础。
Having recognized these potential benefits, world leaders recently met at the Global Conference on Primary Health Care in Astana, Kazakhstan, to endorse a new declaration that commits them to strengthening primary-care systems within their respective countries.	认识到这些潜在的好处，世界领导人最近齐聚哈萨克斯坦阿斯塔纳参加全球初级医疗会议（ Global Conference on Primary Health Care ） ， 支持一项要求各国强化初级医疗制度的新宣言。
But now the hard work begins.	但现在，艰苦的工作才刚开始。
With national leaders considering how best to meet their new commitment, I would emphasize two factors that are integral to making progress.	在与各国领导人思考如何实现新承诺时，我强调两个对于取得进展至关重要的因素。
First, we need to maintain the political will to strengthen primary care and achieve universal health coverage.	首先，我们需要保证强化初级医疗、实现全民健康覆盖的政治意愿。
To that end, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus recently called on heads of state and government to undertake concrete reforms in that direction starting this year.	在这方面，世界卫生组织总干事谭德塞（Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus）最近呼吁各国和政府首脑从今年开始沿着这一方向采取切实的改革。
From my own experience as a former president of Tanzania, I know that persistent, firm, top-level leadership is necessary to move the complex machinery of government.	从我作为坦桑尼亚前总统的个人经验看，深知持续、坚实的顶层领导对于驱动复杂的政府机制是必不可少的。 因此。
That is why I joined with the health advocacy organization Access Challenge to launch the “One by One: Target 2030” campaign on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly this year.	我加入了卫生支持组织普及挑战组织（Access Challenge ） ， 发起了今年联合国大会的非正式议程“一个接一个：目标2030 ” （ One by One: Target 2030）项目。
As part of the campaign, I will be meeting with leaders throughout Africa to encourage them to take tangible steps toward strengthening primary care.	作为该项目的一部分，我将与全非洲的领导人会晤，鼓励他们为强化初级医疗制定具体的措施。
The goal is to protect the basic right to health of every child, adolescent, mother, and family.	目标是保护每一位儿童、青少年、母亲和家庭的基本健康权。
The second key to progress is improved data so that we can monitor what we have accomplished and what work remains to be done.	取得进步的第二个关键是改善数据，以便监控我们完成了哪些工作、还有哪些工作需要完成。
Reliable data are needed to determine whether people are encountering financial or geographic obstacles to health care; whether care is being administered safely and effectively; and whether it is reaching the most marginalized groups in society.	确定人们在求医过程中是否遇到财务或地理方面的障碍、医疗服务是否安全有效、是否覆盖了社会中最边缘的群体，都需要可靠的数据。
National leaders and public health officials need to know all of this and more in order to identify weaknesses in the primary-care system and target areas for improvement.	国家领导人和公共卫生官员需要了解所有这些，才能发现初级医疗体系的弱点，并定位改善领域。
Data are also an important tool for health-care advocates and average citizens who want to track progress over time, hold leaders accountable, and demand the care they need and deserve.	医疗支持者和普通公民想要跟踪一段时间以来的进展、问责领导人、要求他们需要和赢得的开户，也需要数据。
Yet too often, and despite its potential to drive improvement and foster accountability, data collection is treated as an afterthought.	但经常发生的情况是，尽管数据能够带来进步、形成问责，但数据收集工作并没有被列为重点。
The Primary Health Care Performance Initiative is working to address precisely this issue.	初级医疗表现计划（Primary Health Care Performance Initiative，PHCPI）致力于解决这个问题。
At the Global Conference on Primary Health Care, the PHCPI joined with several countries from around the world to launch a new tool to help policymakers and providers improve care.	在全球初级医疗会议上，PHCPI与来自全球的多个国家一起推出了新的工具帮助决策者和供应商改善看护。
With Vital Signs Profiles, they can quickly access information on primary care that is both useful and easy to understand.	它们将利用生命体征情况（Vital Signs Profiles）迅速获得有用又容易理解的初级医疗信息。
As I begin to reach out to African leaders one by one, I look forward to the day when we will have achieved universal health coverage for the world’s 7.7 billion people.	在我与非洲领导人一对一会晤时，我在想象有朝一日我们能够实现覆盖全世界77亿人的全民健康。
With high-level political commitments and new tools for promoting access to care and fostering accountability, I am confident that we can make this ambitious vision a reality.	促进医疗普及、提高可问责性有高层政治意愿和新工具支持，我 有信心我们能够让这一宏大愿景转化为现实。
	
How Can Countries Reduce Poverty Faster?	各国如何更快减贫？
KUALA LUMPUR and MANCHESTER – Can the world end poverty by 2030, the target set by the United Nations Agenda for Sustainable Development?	吉隆坡和曼彻斯特—世界能够在2030年消灭贫困，实现这一联合国可持续发展目标所制定的目标吗？
The UN General Assembly recently reaffirmed this deadline but conceded that meeting it will require “accelerating global actions” to tackle poverty’s causes.	联合国大会最近重申了这一时限，但承认，实现这一目标需要“加快全球行动”解决贫困的根源。
As the international community explores new solutions, lessons from the past could be instructive.	在国际社会探索新方案的时候，历史教训很有指导意义。
Poverty reduction has been central to development policy for decades.	几十年来，减贫一直是发展政策的核心。
During the 15 years of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the predecessor to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the percentage of people living in poverty – defined as less than $1.90 a day – declined significantly, from nearly 27% in 2000, when the MDGs began, to about 9% in 2017.	在千年发展目标（MDG）的15年中，生活在贫苦中的人口 — — 每天生活费低于1.90美元 — — 比例大幅下将，从MDG启动的第一年2000年的近27 % ， 下降到2017年的约 9 % 。 MDG是可持续发展目标（SDG）的前身。
At first glance, the rate of poverty reduction in the first few years of the SDGs has also been impressive.	乍一看，SDG最初几年的减贫速度也令人印象深刻。
Between January 2016 and June 2018, an estimated 83 million people were lifted out of extreme poverty.	2016年1月至2018年6月期间，据估计有8,300万人摆脱了极端贫困。
And yet, to remain on track to meet the 2030 target date, about 120 million people should have escaped poverty during that period.	但是，要保持这一势头，在2030年实现目标，还需要让大约1.2亿人摆脱极端贫困。
Despite the welcome gains, the pace of progress has been less than satisfactory.	尽管进展令人欣喜，但进展的速度差强人意。
In a recent paper co-authored for the journal World Development, we examined what factors drive successful poverty reduction.	在我们为《世界发展 》 （ World Development）杂志合作撰写的最新论文中，我们考察了哪些因素推动了成功的减贫。
Using poverty statistics from developing countries during the MDGs era, we assessed whether countries with higher levels of income poverty – that is, more people living on less money – experienced faster reductions in their poverty rates than economies with lower income-poverty levels.	我们用MDG时期发展中国家的贫困统计数字，评估了是否收入贫困情况更严重的国家 — — 即较多的人依靠较少的钱生活 — — 比收入贫困情况较低的经济体贫困率下降更快。
Using limits of $1.25 and $2 per person per day, we found that poverty tended to decrease faster in countries that started out poorer.	我们用每人每天1.25美元和2美元为下限和上限，发现起点更穷的国家，贫困率往往下降更快。
But these findings, while positive, tell only part of the story.	但这些发现虽然积极，仍只是故事的一部分。
In many countries, the end of poverty remains a distant goal.	在许多国家，消灭贫困仍然是一个遥远的目标。
For example, at the current pace of poverty reduction, we estimate that Mali, where 86% of the population lived on less than $1.25 a day in 1990, will require another 31 years to eradicate extreme poverty altogether.	比如，按照当前减贫速度，我们估计马里 — — 1990年有86%的人口一天花费不到1.25美元 — — 还需要31年时间完全消除极端贫困。
But even in Ecuador, where only 7% of the population lived on less than $1.25 a day in 1990, eliminating poverty will take at least another decade.	但即使是厄瓜多尔 — — 1990年只有7%的人口一天生活费不足1.25美元 — — 消除贫困也至少还需要十年。
The differing experiences of countries in Africa and Asia illustrate that while adoption of the MDG agenda did accelerate poverty reduction, the degree of progress has varied widely.	非洲和亚洲国家的不同经验说明，尽管MDG日程的实施确实加快了减贫速度，但进步的程度各不相同。
In the early 1990s, poverty levels in Nigeria, Lesotho, Madagascar, and Zambia were similar to those in China, Vietnam, and Indonesia.	20世纪90年代初，尼日利亚、莱索托、马达加斯加和赞比亚贫困率和中国、越南和印度尼西亚相近。
But by the time the MDGs ended in 2015, the Asian countries had reduced levels of poverty dramatically; the African countries had not.	但到2015年MDG结束时，业洲国家的贫困水平大幅降低；而非洲国家却没有。
This divergence continues.	差异还在继续。
Today, extreme poverty is mostly contained to Africa; according to the World Bank’s 2018 Poverty and Shared Prosperity report, 27 of the world’s 28 poorest countries are on the continent, and each has a poverty rate above 30%.	如今，极端贫困主要集中在非洲；据世界银行2018年《贫困与共同繁荣 》 （ Poverty and Shared Prosperity）报告，全世界最穷的28个国家有27个在非洲，其中每个国家的贫困率都高于30 % 。
In fact, at current rates of poverty reduction, more than 300 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa will still be poor in 2030.	事实上，按照当前减贫速度，撒哈拉以南非洲的3亿多人要一直穷到2030年。
Many factors have contributed to the shifting geography of poverty.	许多因素导致了贫困地理学的变化。
In Africa, weak economic performance – fueled by conflict, ineffective policies, ethnic fragmentation, and external shocks – has made it more difficult for countries to fund poverty-alleviation programs.	在非洲，经济表现的低迷 — — 原因包括冲突、政策低效、民族分裂和外部冲击 — — 导致各国难以为减贫计划提供资金。
But the most important factor may be state capacity.	但最重要的因素也许是国家能力。
After all, weak state institutions cannot effectively deliver public goods and services.	毕竟，孱弱的国家机构无法有效提供公共品和服务。
Of course, this leads to another question: what factors determine a state’s capacity?	当然，这导致了另一个问题：哪些因素决定了国家能力？
In general, states work better when ruling elites are bound by limits on their power.	一般而言，当执政精英的权力受到限制时，国家会运转得更好。
But administrative experience also plays a role.	但管理经验也起着作用。
China, with a slightly longer period of modern statehood than most of its younger African counterparts, may simply have developed a greater ability to administer its territory.	中国的现代国家历史只比非洲国家略长，但它就发展出更好的治国能力。
And yet, whatever the reason for the variation, there is no doubt that state capacity is one of the key ingredients for successful poverty reduction.	但是，不管差异的原因为何，毫无疑问国家能力是减贫成功的关键要素之一。
We found that during the MDGs, high-poverty countries with strong state institutions were able to reduce poverty twice as fast as countries with feeble capacity, and were more likely to achieve the MDGs’ target of halving poverty by 2015.	我们发现，在MDG期间，贫困率高而国家机构强力的国家的减贫速度可达能力不足国家的两倍，并且更有可能实现到2015年让贫困率降低一半的MDG目标。
Poverty eradication remains a top priority for the 193 governments that have adopted the SDGs.	消除贫困仍然是接受了SDG的193家政府的重点工作之一。
But as the international community learned from the MDGs, goals do not guarantee progress.	但国际社会从MDG中汲取的教训是，目标并不会产生进步。
To ensure that the 725 million people who remained in poverty at the end of MDGs period can escape requires investing in programs that aim at building effective states.	要确保MDG时期结束时仍生活在贫困中的7.25亿人能够摆脱贫困，必须投资于旨在建设高效国家的计划。
Otherwise, an end date for poverty will remain elusive.	否则，消除贫困将遥遥无期。
	
A World of Khashoggis	我们都是卡舒吉
AMMAN – For two months, the brutal murder of the US-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Istanbul, and its geopolitical repercussions, has dominated headlines worldwide.	发自阿曼 — — 两个月来，旅美沙特记者贾迈勒·卡舒吉（Jamal Khashoggi）在沙特驻伊斯坦布尔领事馆遭残酷杀害的事件及其地缘政治影响占据了全球媒体的头条。
But his case is far from an anomaly.	但这起事件其实远非特例。
In fact, according to the International Press Institute, violence against journalists and impunity for the perpetrators are “two of the biggest threats to media freedom in our world today.”	事实上根据国际新闻研究所的说法，针对记者的暴力行为以及肇事者逍遥法外的现象是“当今对世界媒体自由的两项最大威胁 ” 。
Governments often use both carrots and sticks to keep journalists in line.	政府通常会使用胡萝卜加大棒来使记者就范。
They might reward journalists for toeing the official line, using financial or other kinds of bribes. Those who refuse to be bought, however, may suffer the loss of basic rights (such as passport renewal), or have their reputations destroyed.	它们会用金钱或其他类型的贿赂来奖赏那些与官方保持统一口径的记者，而那些拒绝被收买的人可能会被剥夺某些基本权利（例如护照续签）或者遭到抹黑。
To this end, some autocratic regimes emulate US President Donald Trump, calling journalists “enemies” who disseminate “fake news.”	为此，一些专制政权效仿美国总统特朗普，将新闻记者称之为传播“虚假新闻”的“敌人 ” 。
This is a bleak reversal for the United States, a country that has historically set a powerful positive example with its formal and informal mechanisms for protecting freedom of the press and its robust culture of investigative journalism.	对于美国这个历史上一直以其正式和非正式方式新闻自由保护机制以及蓬勃发展的调查新闻文化树立了强大榜样的国家来说，这堪称是一次不光彩的转向。
Imprisonment is another favorite way for autocratic regimes to silence journalists who dare to speak truth to power.	而监禁则是专制政权喜欢用来让那些仗义敢言的记者保持沉默的另一种方式。
In Egypt, Al Jazeera’s Mahmoud Hussein has been detained for two years without trial.	在埃及，半岛电视台的马哈茂德·胡塞因（Mahmoud Hussein）被拘禁了两年还未审判。
In the United Arab Emirates, the Jordanian journalist Tayseer al-Najjar is serving a three-year sentence, which will be prolonged if his family is unable to pay the massive $136,000 fine imposed on him for a post he made on social media.	在阿联酋，约旦记者塔伊西尔·阿尔-纳贾尔（Tayseer al-Najjar）被判刑三年，而如果他的家人无法为他在社交媒体上发布的一篇文章支付高达13.6万美元的罚款，刑期还会被延长。
In Turkey, more than 150 journalists have been imprisoned since the failed coup in July 2016, making the country the world’s biggest jailer of journalists.	在土耳其，自2016年7月政变失败以来已有150多名记者被监禁，使该国成为世界上囚禁记者最多的国家。
And then, of course, there are the journalists who are forced to make the ultimate sacrifice in service of the truth.	当然也有有些记者被迫为真理做出了最大的牺牲。
By one count, 73 journalists have been killed so far this year, and in, 12 countries five or more murders of journalists went unresolved in 2017.	据统计今年迄今为止已有73名记者被杀，而且在2017年在12个国家内各有5起或更多的谋害记者者未得到惩处。
This includes not only violence-plagued countries like Iraq, Somalia, and Syria, but also democracies (and quasi-democracies) like Brazil, India, Mexico, Nigeria, and Russia.	这不仅包括伊拉克，索马里和叙利亚等深陷暴力的国家，还包括一些民主国家（和准民主国家 ） ， 如巴西、印度、墨西哥，尼日利亚和俄罗斯。
Such countries – many of which are allies of the US and other Western countries – have often faced no political or diplomatic price for their actions.	这些国家 — — 其中许多是美国和其他西方国家的盟友 — — 往往并未因此面临政治或外交代价。
In this sense, Khashoggi’s murder sends a powerful message.	从这个意义上说，卡舒吉谋杀案其实释放出了一个强有力的信息。
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is widely believed to have ordered the killing.	人们普遍认为是谋杀命令是由沙特王储穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼（Mohammed bin Salman）下达的。
Yet journalists and human-rights activists in developing countries that benefit from or depend on financial support from Saudi Arabia are being politely (or not so politely) requested to keep quiet as MBS tours the region in order to restore his image.	然而当王储随机前往多个发展中国家访问以恢复其形象时，当地那些受益或依赖于沙特财政支持的记者和人权活动家都被礼貌地（或不那么礼貌地）要求保持沉默。
In many Arab countries, for example, it is a crime to carry out any action or publish anything that could hurt the reputation of “a brotherly or friendly country.”	例如，在许多阿拉伯国家，任何可能损害“兄弟或友好国家”声誉的行为和文章都是犯罪。
So, while Tunisian human-rights activists protested MBS’s recent visit, many Arab activists had to refrain, despite strongly opposing the Saudi leader’s actions, in order to avoid imprisonment.	因此当突尼斯人权活动人士对王储近期的访问表示抗议时，许多阿拉伯活动家尽管强烈反对沙特领导人的行径，但却不得不克制自己以免遭到监禁。
Even some Western countries have failed to take a stand.	甚至一些西方国家也未能挺身而出。
Trump, for example, has declared that he “stands with” Saudi Arabia, a close US ally, largely in order to protect large arms deals with the Kingdom.	比如特朗普就宣称他与沙特“站在一起 ” ， 但主要是为了保障与这一亲密盟友的大宗武器交易。
Among the few who have been courageous enough to speak out are Palestinian journalists living under Israeli occupation.	而在少数勇敢发声的人中则有生活在以色列占领下的巴勒斯坦记者。
More than 150 independent Palestinian journalists have signed an Avaaz petition stating that his murder sets “a dangerous precedent that threatens the lives of journalists, their right to free expression, the freedom of journalistic work, and the right of the public to know.”	150多名独立巴勒斯坦记者联署了一份Avaaz请愿书，声明对他的谋杀案是“一个威胁到记者生命，言论自由权利，新闻工作自由以及公众知情权的危险先例 ” 。
The petition also looks beyond Khashoggi’s case, calling for the enactment of “binding laws that protect journalists, guarantee their right to work in freedom, and punish those who violate this right.”	该请愿书也把目光放在了卡舒吉的案件之外，要求制定“具有约束力的法律以保护记者，保障他们自由工作的权利，并惩罚侵犯这一权利的人 ” 。
Given how widespread crimes against journalists are – and how vital their work is to our societies – the petition’s demands deserve the support of all citizens where press freedom is restricted or under threat.	鉴于针对记者的犯罪行为是如此广泛存在 — — 以及他们的工作对我们社会的重要程度 — — 请愿书的要求应得到所有那些新闻自由受限制或受威胁地区公民的支持。
	
Khrushchev’s Secret Speech and End of Communism	赫鲁晓夫的秘密讲话与共产主义的终结
In history, some events at first appear insignificant, or their significance is hidden, but they turn out to be earthshaking.	历史上，有些事件一开始好像无足轻重，或者其重要意义深藏不露，但随着历史的前进，人们才发现这些事件有着惊天动地的意义。
Such a moment occurred 50 years ago, with Nikita Khrushchev’s so-called “Secret Speech” to the Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.	50年前就发生了这样一个事件，即所谓的赫鲁晓夫苏共20大“秘密讲话 ” 。
It ranks, I believe, just below the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and the start of Hitler’s War in 1939 as the most critical moment of the twentieth century.	我相信，在20世纪重大事件排行榜上，这一事件仅次于“1917年布尔什维克革命”和1939年爆发的“希特勒战争 ” ， 位列第三。
At that moment, the communist movement appeared to be riding the tide of history, and not only for those in the Soviet Union.	当时，共产主义运动在苏联和世界各地风起云涌。
In the mid-1950’s, communism was on the offensive in Europe, as well as in the emerging Third World.	20世纪50年代中期，共产主义在欧洲以及新兴的第三世界范围内咄咄逼人。
Capitalism seemed to be dying.	资本主义好像就要寿终正寝。
All of communism’s imperfections were deemed temporary, just bumps on the way to the just society that was then being born.	人们相信，共产主义虽然有不尽如人意之处，但那不过是通向即将诞生的公平社会之路上的颠簸。
A third of humanity saw the Soviet Union as leading the world toward global socialism.	全世界三分之一的人认为苏联正带领世界走向全球共产主义。
The Twentieth Congress put an end to that.	苏共20大宣告了这一切的终结。
It was a moment of truth, a cleansing from within of the brutality of Stalinism.	那是一个获得真相的时刻，从内部清洗斯大林主义的残暴。
Khrushchev’s speech to the Congress inspired doubt and second thoughts throughout the worldwide Communist movement.	赫鲁晓夫此次大会上的讲话在全世界共产主义运动中引发了怀疑和反思。
Khrushchev’s motives as he took the podium on the morning of February 25, 1956, were, in his mind, moral ones.	1956年2月25日上午，当赫鲁晓夫站在讲话台上时，他认为他的动机的出于道德考虑。
After his ouster from power, in the seclusion of his dacha, he wrote: “My hands are covered with blood.	下台之后，在其隐居的乡间别墅里他写道 ： “ 我的双手沾满了鲜血。
I did everything that others did.	我做了别人所做的一切事情。
But even today if I have to go to that podium to report on Stalin, I would do it again.	但是即使今天，如果还需要我走上那个讲话台揭露斯大林，我将义无反顾。
One day all that had to be over.”	总有结束这一切的那一天 。 ”
Khrushchev had, of course, been an intimate part of Stalin’s repressions, but he also didn’t know half of what was going on.	当然，赫鲁晓夫曾是斯大林专制政权的重要组成部分，但他对所发生的事情也只是知道一半。
The whole Stalinist system of government was built on absolute secrecy, in which only the General Secretary himself knew the whole story.	斯大林主义的整个政府体系都是建立在绝对保密的基础之上，只有总书记本人知道全部的事情。
It wasn’t terror that was the basis of Stalin’s power, but his complete monopoly on information.	恐怖并不是斯大林的政权基础，而是他对信息的绝对垄断。
Khrushchev, for example, was stunned when he discovered that in the 1930’s and 1940’s, some 70% of Party members were annihilated.	例如，当赫鲁晓夫发现在20世纪30年代和40年代大约70%的党员残遭杀害时，他深感震惊。
Initially, Khrushchev didn’t plan to keep his denunciation of Stalin a secret.	最初，赫鲁晓夫并不打算将其对斯大林的揭露与谴责进行保密。
Five days after the Congress, his speech was sent to all the leaders of the socialist countries and read at local party meetings across the Soviet Union.	苏共20大结束5天之后，所有的社会主义国家的领导人都收到了他的讲话稿，苏联各地的党代会上也都宣读。
But people didn’t know how to discuss it.	但是人们不知道如何对之讨论。
And with good reason, for the problem with the de-Stalinization process was that, although the truth was partly revealed, no answer regarding what to do next was offered.	这是有原因的，因为在非斯大林化进程中的问题是，尽管部分真相得到了披露，但是并没有提供下一步如何行动的答案。
After the Congress, it became clear that the communist gospel was false and murderously corrupt.	此次大会之后，共产主义福音的虚伪与致命腐败昭然若揭。 但是，并没有提供其他的意识形态。
But no other ideology was offered, and the crisis – the slow rot of the system that became clear during the era of stagnation under Leonid Brezhnev – that began with Khrushchev’s speech lasted another 30 years, until Mikhail Gorbachev took up his mantle of change.	勃列日涅夫执政的停滞时代这个政权的缓慢腐朽逐渐明显。 赫鲁晓夫讲话始发的危机持续30年之久，直到戈尔巴乔夫扬起改革的大旗。
The doubts inspired at the Congress may have been inchoate, but they nonetheless sowed genuine unrest.	此次大会激起的怀疑可能尚未成熟，但是却播下了动荡不安的种子。
In the first of the protests that rocked the communist world in 1956, huge crowds in Georgia demanded that Khrushchev be fired and Stalin’s memory reinstated.	1956年震惊共产主义世界的第一次抗议声浪中，在格鲁吉亚共和国，大批群众要求赫鲁晓夫下台，恢复斯大林名誉。
An uprising in Poland and the far more tumultuous Hungarian Revolution argued for the opposite.	波兰的起义和比之更为激烈的“匈牙利革命”则持要求相反的东西。
The Poles demanded communism with a human face, and the Hungarians, after Imre Nagy sought to reform communism, ended up wanting no communism at all.	波兰人要求人性化的共产主义，而匈牙利则在纳吉寻求改良共产主义之后彻底抛弃了共产主义。
All of these protests were brutally crushed, which resulted in many West European Communists leaving the Party in utter disillusion.	所有这些抗议活动都遭到了残酷的镇压，导致西欧大批共产党员在理想破灭后脱离共产党。
Khrushchev’s speech also ignited the feud between Mao’s China and the USSR, for it allowed Mao to claim the crown of world revolutionary leadership.	赫鲁晓夫的讲话还导致毛的中国与苏联不和，因为它给毛戴上了世界革命领袖的桂冠。
Worried by the protests, Khrushchev tried to cool off the anti-Stalin campaign.	赫鲁晓夫对这些抗议活动忧心忡忡，试图平息这场反斯大林运动。
The release of the Gulag prisoners that followed his speech continued, but it was done in silence.	发表讲话后开始释放古拉格政治犯继续进行，但却悄无声息。
Party membership was restored to purge survivors, and they received new jobs, but they were forbidden from discussing the horrors that they had endured.	清洗运动中的幸存者被恢复了党籍，安排了新的工作，但却禁止议论其遭遇。
That silence lasted until 1961, when Khrushchev permitted new revelations of Stalin-era crimes.	这种压制持续到1961年，赫鲁晓夫允许再次揭露斯大林时代的罪恶。
These were publicly reported and discussed on TV and radio.	电视和电台公开报道和讨论这些罪恶。
Stalin’s body was removed from Red Square, Stalin monuments were destroyed, and cities restored their original Soviet names.	斯大林的遗体被迁离红场，斯大林纪念碑被破坏，并且各个城市都恢复了原来苏联的名字。
Stalingrad became Volgograd.	斯大林格勒更名为伏尔加格勒。
The idea of the Gulag entered our literature with Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich.	苏联古拉格中的思想随着亚历山大·索忍尼辛《伊凡的一天》进入了我们的文学作��之中。
This second anti-Stalinist campaign lasted two years, which was not nearly enough to change the country’s mentality.	第二场反斯大林运动持续了2年，还不足以改变这个国家的思想状况。
The Twentieth Congress shattered the world Communist movement, and it turned out to be impossible to cement the cracks.	苏共20大粉碎了世界共产主义运动，并且这些碎片再也无法粘合。
The Soviet Union and other socialist countries faced a crisis of faith, as the main threat to communism was not imperialism, or ideological dissidents, but the movement’s own intellectual poverty and disillusion.	苏联和其它社会主义国家都面临着一场信仰危机，因为共产主义的主要威胁不是帝国主义或意识形态上的持不同政见者，而是这场运动本身智识贫乏以及理想破灭。
So, although it is common today in Russia to blame Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin for the collapse of the USSR, it is both useless and unfair to do so.	因此，虽然俄罗斯普遍指责戈尔巴乔夫和叶利钦导致苏联解体，但这样做既没用，也不公平。
The system was dead already, and it is to Yeltsin’s great credit that he was able to bring Russia out of the ruins in one piece.	这个政权体制已经死了，能够带领俄罗斯完整地走出废墟也应归功于叶利钦。
Although Russia’s future is uncertain, its history is becoming clearer, in part because we now know that the Twentieth Party Congress started the process that brought about the end of Soviet despotism.	虽然俄罗斯前途未谱，但它的历史变得更加清晰，部分原因是因为我们现在知道苏共20大开启了苏联专制的终结。
	
Kicking the Oil Habit	打击耗油习惯
Chancellor Angela Merkel has made addressing climate change a high priority on Germany’s agenda for its EU and G-8 presidencies that begin in January.	德国总理默克尔已经将处理气候变化作为将于一月开始的德国担任欧盟和八国集团轮值主席国的高度优先问题。
Here is a concrete proposal, one general enough for world leaders to consider and accept, and clear enough for other governments and businesses to grasp: simply set a date, at the next G-8 summit, by which oil-powered cars would no longer be licensed in major industrialized countries.	不妨提出一个具体的提议，那就是在下一届八国集团首脑会议上制定一个日期，从这一日期以后，主要工业化国家都将不再给由汽油驱动的汽车颁发执照。 这一提议十分通用，足以让世界各国领导人考虑以及接受，而且十分明晰，足以让其他国家政府和工商界人士来加以领会。
Such a decision would have a strongly positive economic and geopolitical impact.	这一决定将会产生极为积极的经济和地缘政治影响。
The real cause of today’s worries over energy is not the decline in world oil reserves, but rather that domestic oil production by the top consumers – Europe, the United States, and China – will decline at the very moment that growing Asian demand strains the market.	如今对于能源的担忧的实际原因并非是世界石油储备的下降，而是最大石油消费国，例如欧洲、美国和中国的国内石油生产在不断增长的亚洲国家需求拖累市场之际下降。
Available reserves will increasingly be concentrated in the Middle East simply because supplies in all other regions will be depleted sooner.	现有的储备将日益集中在中东，简单的原因就是所有其他地区的储备将会提前耗尽。
Moreover, the main oil exporters are unwilling to subordinate their investment policies to market requirements.	而且，主要石油出口国不愿意将它们的投资政策屈从于市场要求。
Saudi Arabia seeks to run its oil production independently, while Iran scares off potential investors with bureaucratic hurdles and corruption.	沙特阿拉伯寻求独立自主地进行石油生产，伊朗以官僚主义障碍和腐败吓跑潜在的投资者。
Iraq suffers from a lack of security, and foreign investors in Russia are thwarted at every turn.	伊拉克苦于缺乏安全，而外国投资者在俄罗斯四处碰壁。
Those four states contain half of the world’s proven oil reserves and two-thirds of what could potentially be exported.	这四个国家拥有世界探明储备的一半以及可能出口的石油的三分之二。
All this, not production costs, lies at the heart of high oil prices and the scramble for oil contracts in Central Asia and Africa.	所有这些、而非生产成本是高油价以及追逐中亚和非洲石油合同的本因。
To believe that high oil prices are good because they serve the environment ignores some basic facts of international politics.	因为对于环境有益而相信高油价是好事就忽略了某些国际关系的基本事实。
First, in many of the poorest African and Asian countries, oil imports account for a significantly higher share of national expenditure than in industrialized countries, which means that economic growth and social development are being imperiled, while new debt crises loom.	首先，许多最穷的亚非国家与工业化国家相比，石油进口在国民支出上占据明显更高的比重。 这就意味着，它们的经济增长以及社会发展受到阻碍，而新的债务危机则呼之欲来。
Rents from oil production impede reforms in the major exporting countries.	石油生产的特许权收入阻碍了主要石油出口国的改革。
Thanks to their lubricated financial strength, regimes like those in Venezuela and Iran increasingly feel unconstrained by international rules.	由于其丰厚的金融实力，像委内瑞拉和伊朗等政权越发感到可以不受国际规则的制约，为所欲为。
Latecomers among consuming nations, such as China, mimic the former habits of the industrialized West, with their long record of overlooking human rights abuses in order to secure lucrative deals with authoritarian, oil-rich regimes.	像中国那样的后来的石油消费国模仿西方工业化国家的旧有习惯，长久以来漠视践踏人权的事例从而与独裁的石油大国政权签定丰厚的合同。
Only the world’s political and economic heavyweights, the main industrialized countries that remain by far the biggest consumers of hydrocarbons, can initiate change on a global scale.	只有当今世界的政治和经济重量级国家、也就是那些碳氢化合物最大的消费国家才能够在全球范围内发动改变。
Change must begin in the transport sector, which accounts for more than half of current oil consumption – a share that is likely to rise in the future.	改变必须从交通行业开始，这一行业占据目前石油消费的一半以上，而且这一比重今后可能会提高。
The G-8 countries should therefore agree to no longer license any new, oil-powered cars from 2025 onwards.	因此，工业八强国家应当同意从2025年以后不再给任何新的、以石油为动力的汽车颁发执照。
This decision would not be directed against individual mobility, but against the dissipation of a scarce resource that is more urgently needed to produce synthetic materials.	这一决定将不会针对个人的行动自由，而是针对制造合成材料上更为迫切需要的稀缺资源的消失。
Political leaders should not privilege any particular technology.	政治领导人不应当给予任何特别的技术以关照。
Instead, they should provide the automobile industry with incentives to develop alternative technologies that rely on bio-mass fuel, ethylene, hydrogen, and even natural gas during a transition period.	相反，他们应该给汽车产业提供激励，发展在过渡时期内依赖于生物燃料、乙烯、氢甚至是天然气的替换性技术。
Countries that lead the way politically will, as a collateral benefit, provide domestic industries with a leading position in energy technology, ensuring future markets.	在政治上发挥领导作用的国家将为国内产业在能源技术上提供领先地位，从而确保未来的市场，而这也是一项附带的利益。
The expected significant reduction of CO2-emissions could eventually bring about the breakthrough that is needed in international climate policies.	预期的大幅度降低二氧化碳排放最终可以带来在国际气候政策中所需要的突破。
But economic development comes into play as well: curing our “addiction” to oil would leave more of it to poorer, less developed, and newly industrializing countries, as well as pushing down prices and easing geopolitical energy competition.	但是，经济发展也发挥作用，那就是，治疗我们对石油的“上瘾”将会把更多的石油留给较为贫困、发展落后以及新兴的工业化国家，同时压低价格，消除地缘政治的能源竞争。
Geopolitically, the benefits would similarly obvious, as the ability of major oil exporters to blackmail industrialized countries would be significantly reduced.	从地缘政治角度而言，其利益也是同样明显的，因为主要石油出口国要挟工业化国家的能力将会被显著降低。
This could increase the bargaining power of the international community in the Middle East, and might strengthen those social forces in countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Russia that seriously wish to promote political and economic reform from within.	这将会提高国际社会在中东的讨价还价的实力，而且可能加强像沙特、伊朗以及俄罗斯等国的那些确实愿意从内部促进政治和经济改革的社会力量。
As a technologically advanced and major automobile-producing country, Germany is well placed to bring about such an initiative.	德国技术先进，而且是主要汽车制造国，具有提出这样一种倡议的地位。
Merkel, who holds a doctorate in physics and started her political career as an environment minister – presiding in 1995 over the first conference of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change – may have more credibility in addressing the issue than any of her EU and G-8 colleagues.	默克尔拥有物理学博士学位，其政治生涯从环境部长开始，1995年主持了首届联合国关于气候变化的框架会议，因此，在处理这一问题上要比她的欧盟和工业八强的同事们更为具有信誉度。
Now is the time for a bold act of leadership.	现在就是做出果敢的领导性行动的时候了。
	
Kick-Starting Employment	启动就业
BERKELEY – Unemployment is currently rising like a rocket, because businesses that normally would be expanding and hiring are not, and those businesses that would normally be contracting and shedding workers are doing so very rapidly.	美国伯克利报道－失业情况目前正如火箭一样飞速上升，因为要进行正常业务发展而需要招聘人才的企业没有得到发展，而那些通常要减员增效的企业则迅速地执行着其任务。
Businesses that ought to be expanding and hiring cannot, because the depressed general level of financial asset prices prevents them from borrowing money or selling bonds on profitable terms.	那些因扩展业务而需招聘人才的企业无法做到这样，是因为金融资产的价格下降的普遍水平让它们无法按照有利可图的条款从外界获得贷款或售出自己的债券。
In response, central banks should purchase government bonds for cash in as large a quantity as needed to push their prices up as high as possible.	作为对这种情况的回应，中央银行应该以必须的大数量现金买入债券，以此来将债券的价格尽可能地抬高。
Expensive government bonds will shift demand to mortgage or corporate bonds, pushing up their prices.	昂贵的政府债券则会将这种需求转移到抵押贷款或公司债券，以此抬高自己的价格。
Even after central banks have pushed government bond prices as high as they can go, they should keep buying government bonds for cash, in the hope that people whose pockets are full of cash will spend more of it, and that this will directly pull people out of joblessness and into employment.	即使在中央银行把政府债券的价格抬到它们能力所能的高价格，央行仍应该不断地买入政府债券以积累资金，以此希望那些口袋满是现金的人能多花些钱，并且也希望这样能直接让人们摆脱失业的困境而走向就业。
In addition, governments need to run extra-large deficits.	此外，政府需要启动超额的大赤字。
Spending – whether by the United States government during World War II, following the Reagan tax cuts of 1981, by Silicon Valley during the late 1990’s, or by home buyers in America’s south and on its coasts in the 2000’s – boosts employment and reduces unemployment.	无论是美国政府在二战期间的开支，还是在里根减税政策之后的20世纪90年代的硅谷的开支，或是21世纪初美国南部购房者在南部港口的开支，都能促进就业，减少失业问题。
And government spending is as good as anybody else’s.	而政府开支能与其它的开支有着同等的力量。
Finally, governments should undertake additional measures to boost financial asset prices, and so make it easier for those firms that ought to be expanding and hiring to obtain finance on terms that allow them to expand and hire.	最后，政府应该承诺采取额外措施来促进金融资产价格的上升，这样才能让那么本应当扩展业务并招募新人才的企业能以优惠的条件获取金融支持来扩展业务并招募人才。
It is this point that brings us to US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner’s plan to take about $465 billion of government money, combine it with $35 billion of private-sector money, and use it to buy up risky financial assets.	也就是这最后一点让我们聚焦于美国财政部长蒂莫西·盖特纳的计划 — — 拿出政府4650亿美元的资金，与私有企业的350亿美元相结合，并用之于买入风险性的金融资产。
The US Treasury is asking the private sector to put $35 billion into this $500 billion fund so that the fund managers all have some “skin in the game,” and thus do not take excessive risks with the taxpayers’ money.	美国财政部要求私有企业拿出350亿资金加入总共5000亿的资金中来，因此基金公司的经理就能拥有些许“脸面 ” ， 这样就不会被指责拿着纳税人的钱去冒过多的风险了。
Private-sector investors ought to be more than willing to kick in that $35 billion, for they stand to make a fortune when financial asset prices close some of the gap between their current and normal values.	私有企业的投资人应该表现得更加情愿地拿出钱凑足350亿美元，因为当金融资产价格在它们目前的价值与正常价值没有任何差异时，它们就能赚上一笔。
If the fund does well over the next five years – returns profits of 9% per year –private investors get a market rate of return on their very risky equity investment and the equivalent of an “annual management fee” equal to 2% of assets under management.	如果资金在今后的5年里表现不错的话 — — 回报率在每年9 % — —那么私有投资人以他们自己风险性较大的产权投资获得市场回报率，以及等同于2%资产管理费的“年管理费 ” 。
If the portfolio does less well – profits of 4% per year – the managers still get a healthy but sub-market return of 10% per year on their equity.	如果投资表现不够理想 — — 年利润率在4 % — —基金经理们仍能以他们的产权投资为基础得到相当丰厚的10%次市场利润率。
And if the portfolio does badly – loses 1% per year – they lose roughly 70% of their investment.	如果投资表现得很糟糕 — — 每年亏损1 % — —那他们则会失去投资总额的70 % 。
Those are attractive odds.	这些都是引人入胜的几率。
Time alone will tell whether the financiers who invest in and run this program make a fortune.	只有时间能告诉我们，投入资金并经营这个项目的金融投资人是否能赚到钱。
But if they do, they will make the US government an even bigger fortune.	如果能赚的话，那他们给美国政府带来的财富则会更丰盛。
And 2% of assets under management is an annual fee that many sophisticated investors have been willing to pay private hedge funds – topped off with an extra fee of 20% of annual profits, which the Treasury is not paying.	而像2%的资产管理费这样的年费，许多久经世故的投资人都会愿意拿来支付私人对冲基金 — — 最终要花费掉年利润中的20%做为额外费用，美国财政部不会支付这笔费用。
The fact that the Geithner Plan is likely to be profitable for the US government is, however, a sideshow.	然而，盖特纳计划可能会让美国政府获取利润的事实却是一个滑稽闹剧。
The aim is to reduce unemployment.	该计划的目的是减少失业。
The appearance of an extra $500 billion in demand for risky assets will reduce the quantity of risky assets that other private investors will have to hold.	为买入危险性资产而需要的额外5000亿美元的出现将减少危险资产的数量，这些是私有投资人所必须持有的。
And the sudden appearance of between five and ten different government-sponsored funds that make public bids for assets will convey information to the markets about what models other people are using to try to value assets in this environment.	��5或10种不同的政府赞助且需要公众竞相购买的基金的突然出现将向市场传达一个讯息，即在这种环境之下，其他人在为资产估值时会使用什么模式。
This sharing of information will reduce risk – somewhat.	信息的共享多少能减少风险。
When assets are seen as less risky, their prices rise.	当资产的风险性看似不大时，它们的价格就能上升。
And when there are fewer assets to be held, their prices rise, too.	而当资产的持有率少之又少时，资产的价格也能上升。
With higher financial asset prices, those firms that ought to be expanding and hiring will be able to get money on more attractive terms.	金融资产的价格越高，那些本该扩展业务并招募人才的企业将能够以更有优势的条件获得利润。
The problem is that the Geithner Plan appears to me to be too small – between one-eight and one-half of what it needs to be.	问题在于，盖特纳计划对我来说规模太小 — — 只达到了它所应有程度的八分之一与五分之一之间。
Even though the US government is doing other things as well –fiscal stimulus, quantitative easing, and other uses of bailout funds – it is not doing everything it should.	尽管美国政府也在进行其它事务 — — 财政刺激、定量放松，并使用了其它救援资金 — — 但盖特纳计划没有做好它应该完成的一切。
My guess is that the reason that the US government is not doing all it should can be stated in three words: Senator George Voinovich, who is the 60th vote in the Senate – the vote needed to close off debate and enact a bill.	我猜想，美国政府没有做到它应该做的一切的原因能以三个字来描述：参议员约翰·沃诺维奇，他是参议院的第60投票，这个投票是结束辩论并通过一项法案的必须的投票。
To do anything that requires legislative action, the Obama administration needs Voinovich and the 59 other senators who are more inclined to support it.	要做任何需要立法行为的事情，奥巴马政府都沃诺维奇与其他更加支持他的59为议员。
The administration’s tacticians appear to think that they are not on board – especially after the recent AIG bonus scandal – whereas the Geithner Plan relies on authority that the administration already has.	奥巴马政府的战略家们似乎认为他们无权干涉此事，特别四在最近美国国际集团的奖金丑闻事件之后，而盖特纳计划却依赖于政府现有的权威人士。
Doing more would require a legislative coalition that is not there yet.	要达到更大的目标需要一个立法联合，但这种联合现在还没有形成。
	
Kidney for Sale	待售的肾
NEW HAVEN – World Kidney Day, to be held on March 12, is part of a global health campaign meant to alert us to the impact of kidney disease.	纽黑文—3月12日是世界肾脏日，也是旨在让人们警惕肾脏疾病的全球健康活动的组成部分之一。
Sadly, there is little to celebrate.	悲哀的是，没有什么可庆祝的。
According to the International Society of Nephrology, kidney disease affects more than 500 million people worldwide, or 10% of the adult population.	根据国际肾病学会的消息，世界范围内有超过5亿人受到肾脏疾病的影响，或者说是成年人的10 % 。
With more people developing high blood pressure and diabetes (key risks for kidney disease), the picture will only worsen.	随着越来越多的人身患高血压和糖尿病（这是肾脏疾病带来的的主要危险 ） ， 情况只会变得更糟。
There are 1.8 million new cases of the most serious form of kidney disease – renal failure – each year.	最严重的肾脏疾病—肾衰竭—每年会新增180万例。
Unless patients with renal failure receive a kidney transplant or undergo dialysis – an expensive life-long procedure that cleanses the blood of toxins – death is guaranteed within a few weeks.	除非肾衰竭患者接受肾移植或是进行透析（这种程序可以清楚血液内的毒素，但是价格昂贵，还要持续终生 ） ， 几周之内就会死亡。
Last year, an Australian nephrologist, Gavin Carney, held a press conference in Canberra to urge that people be allowed to sell their kidneys.	去年，澳大利亚肾病学家嘉文·卡尼在堪培拉举行了一次新闻发布会，主张应该允许人们出售他们的肾脏。
“The current system isn't working,” the Sydney Morning Herald quoted him as saying. “We’ve tried everything to drum up support” for organ donation, but “people just don’t seem willing to give their organs away for free.”	“现行制度不起作用 ” ， 《悉尼先驱晨报》援引他的话说 ： “ 我们已经竭尽所能来争取支持”器官捐赠，但是“人们似乎就是不愿意免费献出他们的器官 ” 。
Carney wants to keep patients from purchasing kidneys on the black market and in overseas organ bazaars.	卡尼想要阻止病人从黑市或是海外器官市场购买肾脏。
As an American recipient of a kidney who was once desperate enough to consider doing that myself (fortunately, a friend ended up donating to me), I agree wholeheartedly that we should offer well-informed individuals a reward if they are willing to save a stranger’s life.	作为一位美国的肾脏接受者，我也曾经绝望到想要这样做，幸运的是一位朋友离世的时候把肾脏捐给了我。 我全心全意地赞同：如果有人在了解情况后愿意拯救陌生人的生命，我们应该报答他。
If not, we will continue to face a dual tragedy: on one side, the thousands of patients who die each year for want of a kidney; on the other side, a human-rights disaster in which corrupt brokers deceive indigent donors about the nature of surgery, cheat them out of payment, and ignore their post-surgical needs.	如果不这样做，我们将继续面对双重悲剧：一方面，每年有数千位病人因为没有肾源而死亡；另一方面，腐败的掮客就手术的性质对贫穷的捐献者进行欺骗，骗走他们的酬劳，忽视他们手术后的需要，引发了人权灾难。
The World Health Organization estimates that 5% to 10% of all transplants performed annually – perhaps 63,000 in all – take place in the clinical netherworlds of China, Pakistan, Egypt, Colombia, and Eastern Europe.	国际卫生组织估计每年大约总计为63000的移植手术中，有5%到10%发生在中国、巴基斯坦、埃及、哥伦比亚和东欧最下层的诊所里。
Unfortunately, much of the world transplant establishment – including the WHO, the international Transplantation Society, and the World Medical Association – advocates only a partial remedy.	不幸的是，大部分世界移植机构（包括世界卫生组织，国际移植协会，世界医学协会）都赞成只进行部分补偿。
They�focus on ending organ trafficking but ignore the time-tested truth that trying to stamp out illicit markets either drives them further underground or causes corruption to�reappear elsewhere.	他们关注的焦点是终止器官走私，却忽视了一条经过时间验证的真理：试图消灭地下违法市场不是让它们转入更地下，就是使得腐败在其他地方再次出现。
For example, after China, India, and Pakistan began cracking down on illicit organ markets, many patients turned to the Philippines.	例如，在中国、印度和巴基斯坦开始打击地下器官市场之后，许多病人转向菲律宾。
Last spring, after the Philippines banned the sale of kidneys to foreigners, a headline in the Jerusalem Post read, “Kidney Transplant Candidates in Limbo after Philippines Closes Gates.”	当菲律宾去年春季禁止向外国人出售肾脏之后 ， 《 耶路撒冷邮报》出现了这样的大字标题 ： “ 菲律宾关闭大门之后, Limbo的肾移植候选者 ” 。
(Israel has one of the lowest donation rates in the world, so the government pays for transplant surgery performed outside the country.)	（以色列是全球捐献率最低的国家之一，因此政府会给境外的移植手术付费。
Similarly, patients from Qatar who traveled to Manila are “looking for alternative solutions,” according to The Peninsula .	）同样，据《半岛日报》报道，前往马尼拉的卡塔尔患者正在“寻找替代的解决办法 ” 。
True, more countries must develop efficient systems for posthumous donation, a very important source of organs.	的确，更多的国家必须发展高效的死后捐赠体制，这是一个重要的器官源。
But even in Spain, which is famously successful at retrieving organs from the newly deceased, people die while waiting for a kidney.	但是，即便在以成功使新近死者身上的器官得以再生利用而闻名于世的西班牙，人们依然会在等待肾源的过程中死去。
The truth is that trafficking will stop only when the need for organs disappears.	事实是：只有不需要器官的时候，走私才能停止。
Opponents allege that a legal system of exchange will inevitably replicate the sins of the black market.	反对者声称，合法的交换体制将会不可避免地复制黑市里的罪恶。
This is utterly backward.	这完全是一种落后的观念。
The remedy to this corrupt and unregulated system of exchange is a regulated and transparent regime devoted to donor protection.	为了纠正这种腐败堕落、不受控制的交易体制，可以施行一种受到管理，公开透明，致力于保护捐献者的新体制。
My colleagues and I suggest a system in which compensation is provided by a third party (government, a charity, or insurance) with public oversight.	我的同事和我建议建立这样一种体制，其中补偿由第三方（政府，慈善机构，保险公司）来提供，受到公众监督。
Because bidding and private buying would not be permitted, available organs would be distributed to the next in line – not just to the wealthy.	因为不允许竞价和私下购买，获得的器官将会分给下一个等候者，而不是仅仅分给富人。
Donors would be carefully screened for physical and psychological problems, as is currently done for all volunteer living kidney donors.	捐献者将会接受身体和心理方面的仔细筛选，就象现在所有活体肾脏的志愿捐献者所作的一样。
Moreover, they would be guaranteed follow-up�care for any complications.	而且，还会保证他们的任何并发症都会受到后续护理。
Many people are uneasy about offering lump-sum cash payments.	许多人都为提供一次性的现金偿付感到担心。
A solution is to provide in-kind rewards – such as a down payment on a house, a contribution to a retirement fund, or lifetime health insurance – so that the program would not be attractive to people who might otherwise rush to donate on the promise of a large sum of instant cash.	解决方法之���是提供实物回报，例如一栋房子的首付，捐给退休基金的一笔款子，或是终生的健康保险，以便这个项目不会吸引这样一批人：为了马上收到一大笔现金的承诺，他们就会冲过去捐肾。
The only way to stop illicit markets is to create legal ones.	阻止地下违法市场的唯一途径就是建立合法市场。
Indeed, there is no better justification for testing legal modes of exchange than the very depredations of the underground market.	的确，试行合法交易模式的最佳辩护理由就是地下市场正在进行大肆掠夺。
Momentum is growing.	这种势头正在加强。
In the British Medical Journal , a leading British transplant surgeon called for a controlled donor compensation program for unrelated live donors.	英国一位著名的移植外科大夫在《英国医学杂志》上号召为非亲活体捐赠者通过一个加以控制的捐献者补偿计划。
Within the last year, the Israeli, Saudi, and Indian governments have decided to offer incentives ranging from lifelong health insurance for the donor to a cash benefit.	过去一年中，以色列、沙特和印度政府已经决定提供奖励，范围涉及捐赠者的终生健康保险到现金收益。
In the United States, the American Medical Association has endorsed a draft bill that would make it easier for states to offer various non-cash incentives for donation.	在美国，美国医学会已经批准了一项议案草案，使得各州能够更方便地为捐献行为提供各种非现金的奖励。
Until countries create legal means of rewarding donors, the fates of Third World donors and the patients who need their organs to survive will remain morbidly entwined.	除非各国创立出酬劳捐赠者的合法方式，第三世界捐赠者的命运和需要器官移植来存活下去的病人的命运将会继续可怕地缠绕在一起。
What better way to mark World Kidney Day than for global health leaders to take a bold step and urge countries to experiment with donor rewards?	对于关注世界肾脏日来说，还有比全球的健康领袖们迈出勇敢的一步，敦促各国试行为捐赠者提供回报更好的方法吗？
	
Killer Fish Farms	养鱼场杀手
A recent report by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization found that almost half of all the fish eaten worldwide are raised on fish farms rather than caught in the wild.	根据最近由联合国粮农组织发表的一份报告显示我们所吃的鱼几乎有一半来自养鱼场而不是野生的。
It is likely that consumption of no other fish has soared more than that of farmed salmon, with production surging by almost 300% in 20 years.	在此方面，养殖鲑鱼的消费量增长应该是最快的，它的产量在过去20年间急剧上升了大约300 % 。
Salmon are carnivorous, however, and to feed the voracious appetite of these legions of farm-raised fish, the aquaculture industry increasingly has turned its attention to a small crustacean commonly known as Antarctic krill.	然而，鲑鱼是食肉动物，为了满足这些大批的人工养殖的鱼类的贪婪的食欲，水产业开始越来越多地把他们的注意力放在了一种通常叫做南极磷虾的很小的甲壳纲动物身上。
But that’s bad news for leopard seals and Adelie penguins, humpback and blue whales, and many other species, because most organisms in the Antarctic marine ecosystem eat either krill or something that eats krill.	但是那对于海豹、阿黛利企鹅、座头鲸、蓝鲸以及其他许多物种来说却是一个坏消息，因为绝大部分南极海洋生态系统的生物体依靠吃磷虾或者其他吃磷虾的东西为生。
Found in the cold waters of the Southern Ocean, krill constitute a key ingredient in fish oil and feed.	这种在南大洋冰冷的海水里发现的磷虾是鱼的油脂和饲料的一种重要成分。
Unfortunately, recent research indicates that expanded krill fishing might put the Antarctic ecosystem at risk.	不幸的是，最近的研究显示被扩大的磷虾捕捉会威胁到南极的生态系统。
Representatives from the world’s major fishing nations, meeting this fall in Australia, have an opportunity to limit krill catches, thereby helping creatures that need krill to survive.	来自世界上主要捕鱼国的代表今年秋天聚集在澳大利亚商议限制磷虾的捕捉量以此来帮助那些以磷虾为生的生物。
Although each krill may only grow to weigh about two grams, together they constitute one of the most abundant animal species on Earth.	尽管一只磷虾只能长到2克重，但是合在一起它们却组成了地球上动物种群之一。
Indeed, krill form the largest known aggregation of marine life, with a biomass perhaps greater than any other multi-cellular animal organism on the planet.	事实上，磷虾是海洋生命中数量最为庞大的物种，其数量也许比地球上任何其他多分子的动物都要多。
This “pink gold” forms the heart of the Antarctic marine food web, and land-based krill predators, such as penguins and seals, are most vulnerable to krill scarcity.	这种“红金色”的动物是南极海洋食物链的核心，而一些在陆地活动的食磷虾的动物，如企鹅和海豹，面对磷虾数量的减少会显得尤其脆弱。
Scientists have found that demand for krill has begun to exceed supply in some areas of the Southwest Atlantic.	科学家们已经发现南极洲的西南部分的一些地区磷虾的数量已经无法满足需求了。
As a result, penguins and albatrosses already experience difficulty rearing their offspring in areas such as South Georgia.	其结果是，在像南乔治亚岛这样的一些地区企鹅和信天翁在哺育它们的后代方面已经开始面临很大的困难。
And yet krill fishing is projected to grow.	然而人们还在计划扩大磷虾的捕捉量。
The Southern Ocean contains the largest population of krill in the world.	南大洋有着世界上最多的磷虾。
As krill tend to aggregate in concentrated swarms, they are easy to catch and have become particularly attractive to large-scale commercial interests.	因为磷虾喜欢成群结队地活动，所以它们很容易被捕捉因而特别容易吸引大规模商业利益的兴趣。
Moreover, krill fishing has recently been fueled by new technological advances such as vacuum pumps, which allow a single fishing vessel to catch and process huge amounts – up to 120,000 metric tons per season.	此外，最近一些新的科技进展更加促进了磷虾的捕捉。 比如说真空泵，它使得一只捕鱼船就能捕捉和加工极大数量的磷虾，每个季节超过12万公吨。
Furthermore, demand for krill products – from fish oil and feed to skin creams and other cosmetics – has increased over the past 20 years.	另外，对于磷虾产品的需求，从鱼油、鱼饲料到面霜和其他化妆品在过去20年间也变得越来越大。
As wild fish populations continue to decrease, in tandem with an ever-growing global appetite for seafood, the pressure on the aquaculture industry for fish feed will skyrocket.	因为野生鱼类的数量在不断地减少，加上全球对于海产品越来越大的需求，水产业迫切需要大量的鱼饲料。
The increased demand for krill, together with the new catching and processing capabilities, has combined in a way that the Antarctic ecosystem might not be able to withstand.	对于磷虾越来越大的需求量，以及新的捕捉和加工能力，使得南极的生态系统越来越难以承受。
But there is hope.	但是希望还是有的。
The Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) was established in 1982, as part of the Antarctic Treaty System, in response to concerns that continued unregulated fishing might undermine the basis of the Antarctic food chain.	作为南极协约系统的一部分，成立于1982的南极海洋生命资源保护公约（CCAMLR）就是对持续无限制的捕捉会破坏南极食物链的基础的担忧的回应。
The CCAMLR is governed by a commission of 24 member states – including Argentina, Australia, Chile, Japan, Norway, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Ukraine, the United States and the European Union – that meets annually in Hobart, Australia, to discuss new fishing regulations concerning marine species in the Southern Ocean.	南极海洋生命资源保护公约由一个由24个成员国所组成的委员管理，包括阿根廷、澳大利亚、智利、日本、挪威、俄罗斯、南非、韩国、乌克兰、美国和欧盟。 它们每年在澳大利亚的霍巴特聚会讨论关于在南大洋捕捉海洋物种的新的规定。
The CCAMLR has pioneered ecosystem and precautionary approaches to fisheries management, which are now central to maintaining Antarctic krill.	南极海洋生命资源保护公约倡导在渔业管理上重视生态系统和采取谨慎的捕捉方法，现在他们把这用在了对于南极磷虾的保护上。
Although the needs of krill-dependent species were previously considered for large areas of the Southern Ocean, the CCAMLR must still scientifically subdivide the overall catch limit into smaller units.	尽管人们以前认为以磷虾为生的物种生活在南大洋的大片地区，南极海洋生命资源保护公约依然必须科学地把总体上的捕捉限制再加以细分。
This would help avoid local competition between krill vessels and the creatures that need krill to live, since krill fishing closely overlaps with the critical foraging areas for penguins and seals.	这将有助于避免捕捉磷销的船只与依靠磷销为升的生物之间的竞争，因为磷虾的捕捉区域与企鹅和海豹觅食的重要区域严重重叠。
The CCAMLR’s members must honor the organization’s mandate for conservation and ensure that there is enough “pink gold” to feed the penguins and other wildlife that depend on it.	南极海洋生命资源保护公约的成员国必须执行该组织关于保护物种的指令并且确保有足够的这种“红金色”动物供给企鹅和其他以此为生的野生生命。
The CCAMLR should also apply to krill fishing the same monitoring, control, and surveillance measures that it requires for all other fisheries.	南极海洋生命资源保护公约还应该把对磷虾捕捉的这些监督管理措施实施到所有其他也有此要求的渔业上。
Antarctic krill must not be fished to feed the fish farms of the world while starving the penguins, seals, whales, and other species whose survival depends on these tiny, but vitally important, creatures.	人们不应捕捉南极磷虾去喂养养鱼场的鱼类而让那些依靠这些细小、但却极其重要的动物为生的企鹅、海豹、鲸和其他物种饱受饥饿。
	
Killing Growth in Russia	扼杀俄罗斯的经济增长
I want Russia to be a boring country – at least for the next few decades.	我宁愿俄罗斯变成一个令人乏味的国家，至少在今后的几十年中。
In the twentieth century, Russia set an unquestionable record for all sorts of upheavals and social experiments that attracted the world’s attention.	二十世纪的俄罗斯创造了一份不容质疑的纪录，包括经历了各种各样的动乱剧变和社会实践，吸引了全世界的关注目光。
A time-out is essential.	现在该是暂停的时候了。
This objective seemed to be entirely within reach – or at least possible – until the first half of 2003.	在2003年上半年前，我们似乎还可以不费吹灰之力地达成这个目标，至少很有可能达到。
Foreign correspondents accredited in Moscow complained that nothing was happening in Putin’s Russia.	受命驻莫斯科的外国记者还曾抱怨普京管理下的俄罗斯波澜不惊，无甚可报道。
Investment in the Russian economy was growing fast.	俄罗斯的经济投资呈高速发展。
Unfortunately, Russia’s rulers are not accustomed to leaving the country and the rest of the world for long without something surprising to gawk at.	不幸的是，俄罗斯当权者还未习惯这种状态，隔不了多久他们总要做出些让本国和世界各国目瞪口呆的惊人之举。
Instilling a feeling of insecurity is the best way to scare your population into submission and frighten away potential investors.	恐吓你的人民使他们屈从听命的最有效方法是逐步灌输安全丧失感，此法同时亦能吓跑潜在投资者。
How democratic or undemocratic a regime is usually doesn't bother investors. All they need and care about is stable, predictable rules.	通常，困扰投资者的问题不是一个政权民主与否，投资者需要并且在意的，是稳定且可预见的政策。
Indeed, the watchword among major investors is inertia.	事实上，巨额投资者们都信奉惯性二字。
It takes time to reach a decision on whether or not to invest in a project, and once an investment decision is made, it becomes rather difficult to stop the process quickly.	一个投资项目需要时间达成共识，而一旦决定作出，要立刻叫停这个项目则更为艰难。
Russia’s government is now doing its best to prove that, while difficult, it is possible to defy the laws of business physics and kill investments that are already in the pipeline.	俄罗斯政府此刻正竭其全力要证明，即使困难重重，他们也是有可能打破商业常规，扼杀已在进行中的投资项目。
When Mikhail Khodorkovsky and other executives of Yukos, his oil company, were arrested last year, corporations investing or interested in investing in Russia were prepared to interpret the crackdown as an isolated incident brought on by the political agenda of the company and its CEO, who should have known better.	去年，尤科斯石油公司原首席执行官米卡耶·克多可夫斯基和他公司的其他高层人员被捕，正在俄罗斯进行投资及有意向投资的公司已准备好将此次打击镇压当作一个独立事件来看待，全由该公司及其首席执行官的政治议程所引起，个中缘由应该只有克多可夫斯基才比较清楚。
Never mind that by the second half of 2003, it had become obvious that the government intended to use legal means – in the form of massive tax claims – to destroy the company.	也难怪，到2003年下半年末，政府准备动用法律手段 — — 以大规模税款申索的方式 — — 以打垮该公司的意图已十分明显。
When only one company faced legal and financial problems, investors who had made a decision to put their money in Russia were ready to ignore this kind of development.	若仅有一家公司出现法律和经济问题，那些有意向把钱投放在俄罗斯的投资者们往往情愿忽略这一事态的发展。
“This must be an exception,” they kept repeating, like a mantra or a prayer.	“这一定是个例外 ， ” 他们总是这么重复，宛如重复着咒语，又像在祈祷。
I’ve heard something similar when Russian problems are discussed: “Just finish this Yukos affair.	我也在人们讨论俄罗斯问题时听到过类似的话语 ， “ 快点结束尤科斯的案子吧！
We don’t care how it goes, just put an end to it.”	我们才不在乎它进行得如何呢，早日了结它吧！
Unfortunately, the genie has been let out of the bottle.	不幸的是，妖魔一旦出瓶就那难以收回。
Throughout 2004, it became abundantly clear that Russia’s internal security apparatus had gained the upper hand in deciding how to manage economic and political problems.	2004一整年，比起经济和政治问题的管理，俄罗斯国内的安全设施建设明显占据了上风。
Security structures developed a taste for this kind of work, and welcomed new responsibilities.	安全机构对这项工作乐此不疲，对新职责颇为欢迎。
In many ways, they began to see fighting big business as akin to fighting terrorists.	从很多方面来看，他们开始把反巨大型企业与反恐行动一样对待。
And, indeed, they share one thing in common: the fight never ends.	确实，有一点是共通的：这场战争永无终日。
More and more tax claims are being produced, and not only against Yukos.	除了针对尤科斯石油公司之外，越来越多的税款申索开始起草。
Tax claims against the telecommunications company Vympelkom (one of Russia’s leading firms, and the first to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 90 years) send an unambiguous signal to investors: no one is safe.	矛头直指Vympelkom电信公司的税款申索（俄罗斯最大的电信运营商，也是过去90年中第一个在纽约证券交易所上市的公司）向所有的投资者发出了一个明确无误的信号：没有谁能够幸免于难。
In fact, official documents have now even started questioning the legitimacy of the privatization of the leading Russian companies in the 1990’s, which has opened the way for discussions about revising the outcomes of these privatizations.	事实上，官方文件甚至已经开始质疑1990年代俄罗斯大公司私有化的合法性，并启动了有关修正这些私有化成果的讨论。
Similarly, British Petroleum, which has invested more in Russia than any other company to date, has recently discovered that its rights to the Kovytkino gas field are not guaranteed at all. This property, it now seems, could be reclaimed by the state at any moment.	与此同时，目前为止在俄罗斯境内投资最多的英国石油公司最近已经发现他们在Kovytkino油田的权利已完全得不到保障。
It would be wrong to draw long-term conclusions from short-term economic information, even if this information confirms reality.	要从短期经济信息中得出长期结论是种错误做法，即使这些信息应证了事实。
The alarming tendencies we are seeing today may be short-lived and with no serious consequences.	今日我们目睹的趋势令人担忧，但也可能是短暂无常且不会造成严重后果的。
Post-socialist growth is a process that cannot (and should not) be easily stopped.	后社会主义的急速增长已经难以（也不该）止步。
If, however, the authorities continue their efforts to destabilize the Russian economy, today’s disturbing tendencies may actually take root.	然而，如果政府继续不遗余力地破坏俄罗斯经济，那么目前这种令人担忧的趋势将会扎根于俄罗斯。
Russia can then forget about attaining the fast, sustainable growth that China has achieved. Instead, we Russians will find ourselves trying to avert an impending economic crisis.	到彼时，俄罗斯就该彻底忘掉中国所取得的快速持续的经济增长，取而代之是发现自己正在全力避免一场日益迫近的经济危机。
Of course, no one can predict when such a crisis might occur.	当然，没有人可以预见这场危机何时发生。
But one thing is certain: we will know which path the country’s leaders have chosen sooner rather than later.	但是有一点却是肯定的：我们迟早会知道国家领导人究竟选择了哪条路。
Indeed, this year could be Russia’s most fateful yet.	毫无疑问，今年将会是俄罗斯最至关重大的一年。
	
Killing the Death Penalty	废除死刑
It is finally happening.	人们终于等来了这一时刻。
After 13 years of negotiations, delays, and hesitation, the UN General Assembly will vote this month on the proposal for a universal moratorium on the death penalty.	经过13年的谈判、推迟以及犹豫，联合国大会将在本月对一项全面暂停死刑提议进行投票。
A large majority of the UN adopted the proposal on 15 November, despite attempts by some member states to obstruct, amend, or bury it.	联合国的大多数成员国不顾某些国家的阻挠、修正或者终结的企图在11月15日通过了这一提议。
Fortunately, in the end, the opponents were forced to fight a will stronger than their own: the will of those who – after the abolition of slavery and torture – want to mark another turning point for civilization.	所幸的是，最终，反对国家被迫与一个比它们自己的更为强烈的意志斗争，也就是，在废除了奴隶制和酷刑后，想要在文明的道路上做出另一个转折点的人们的意志。
But will this December’s vote be a mere formality?	但是，今年12月的投票仅仅是例行公事吗？
Experience teaches us to be prudent.	经验告诉告诉我们要谨慎。
I have not opened my bottle of spumante yet.	我现在还没有开酒庆贺。
To be honest, I am not sure that all of the world’s governments have accepted the inevitable, or that even the most inflexible will now agree to the moratorium.	坦率而言，我并不确信世界上所有国家政府都已经接受了这一不可避免的事实，或者即使最为顽固的现在也会同意暂停死刑。
But I continue to have faith that the General Assembly will know, as always, how to meet this challenge.	但是，联合国大会将会像以往一贯那样面对挑战。 我对此继续保持信念。
We are all aware that even if the vote succeeds, the UN resolution will not be binding, and that establishing and enforcing a moratorium is only a necessary mid-way step toward full abolition.	我们都知道，即使投票成功，这一联合国决议也没有约束力，而且，确立和执行暂停死刑只是朝向全面废除目标上必要一步。
I believe the UN should push for an immediate de facto suspension, without waiting for the debates to begin on legal reforms in the respective countries.	我相信，联合国应该不等候有关国家法律改革辩论开始就推动立即在事实上中止死刑。
I hope that this approach will allow a wide consensus in the General Assembly, and that any last minute change of heart will fail.	我相信这一手段将会在联合国大会形成广泛共识，而且最后时刻的改变主意将不会成功。
One big lesson I learned during the struggle to create the International Criminal Court (ICC), and now during the battle for a moratorium on the death penalty, is that it is often better to aim for a realistic result rather than a perfect one.	我在建立国际刑事法庭以及现在暂停死刑的奋斗中所学到的一大的教训就是，很多时候退而求其次往往要好一点。
Before the international community established the ICC, there were two ad hoc tribunals – one for the former Yugoslavia and one for Rwanda. Their work paved the way for the ICC.	国际社会建立国际刑事法庭之前有两个临时法庭，一个用于前南斯拉夫，另一个用于卢旺达。 这两个法庭的工作为国际刑事法庭铺平了道路。
Some European Union countries wanted to push for complete abolition of the death penalty right away.	某些欧盟国家想要立即推动完全废除死刑。
I understand their position.	我理解它们的立场。
I would have wanted the same thing myself.	我原本自己也想要这样。
But had we followed that route, we would most likely have failed.	但是如果我们按照这样行事，我们极有可能失败。
There is an important lesson in this for the EU at a time when it is seeking to become a global actor: we must reach an internal consensus while always bearing in mind what the external ramifications of our decision might be.	欧盟正在寻求成为一个全球性力量。 在这一时候，欧盟有一个重要的经验教训，那就是我们必须达成内部一致，同时总是知道我们的决定所可能带来的外部影响。
On the moratorium, we remained pragmatic and built a strong European foreign policy.	在暂停死刑问题上，我们保持了现实主义并且建立了一个强大的欧洲外交政策。
And it was an advantage in the UN negotiations to have a common Europeans position and to have spoken with a single voice.	在联合国谈判中具有一个共同的欧洲立场以及用一个声音说话是一个优势。
A second lesson that I learned is also useful for the EU, which finds itself in a world in which new powers are emerging and where all actors from Manila to Algiers, from Doha to Libreville, must deal with the challenges of globalization and interdependence on a daily basis.	我所学到的第二个经验教训对欧盟也有作用。 当今世界新的大国正在显现，欧盟必须每天都处理全球化和相互依赖的挑战。
That lesson is that Europe has more friends than it has enemies in the world.	得出的经验就是，在世界上，欧盟的朋友要比敌人多。
These friends deserve respect and attention.	这些朋友值得尊重和关注。
If Italy and the EU had not understood the need to work with non-European countries, and make them feel that they were responsible and fully-fledged protagonists, the efforts to establish the ICC and be so close to declare a universal moratorium on the death penalty would have failed.	如果意大利和欧盟没有理解与非欧盟国家合作的需要，并且让它们感到它们是负责以及完全的主角，建立国际刑事法庭以及如此接近全面暂停死刑就会失败。
I know that this is not exactly a new lesson, but it is what I have in mind when I think of efficient multilateralism.	我知道，这并非是一个全新的经验，但是当我思考有效的多边主义的时候我总是想到这一点。
Not only does it work, but, above all, in some cases, it is the only way of moving forward.	它不仅可以奏效，而且在某些情况下，它是前进的唯一途径。
Finally, a third lesson – relevant to the fight against the death penalty and, indeed, to winning any political battle – is perseverance, which I consider to be a mix of pig-headedness and the ability to maintain one’s position.	最后，第三个经验就是坚持不懈。 这与废除死刑的斗争以及赢得任何政治斗争有关。
Without perseverance, there can be no progress.	我认为这结合了固执和坚持自己立场的能力。 没有坚持不懈就没有进步。
All this is a success, not only for anti-death penalty radicals, for the “Hands off Cain” association, the Italian government, and for the European Union and its friends in the world.	所有这些都是一个成功，这不仅对废除死刑的极端人士而言如此，而且对于废除死刑协会、意大利政府、欧盟及其在全世界的朋友而言也是如此。
It is much more: it is a success for all those who believe that it is still possible to improve our world – and ultimately the human condition – every day.	其意义不止如此，这对于所有相信依旧有可能每天改良世界以及最终改良人类境况的人而言都是一个成功。
	
Is Tsipras the New Lula?	齐普拉斯是新卢拉吗？
CAMBRIDGE – Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has the chance to become to his country what South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva were to theirs: a man of the left who moves toward fiscal responsibility and freer markets.	美国剑桥—希腊总理齐普拉斯有机会成为希腊的金大中（韩国总统）和卢拉（巴西总统 ） — —推进财政责任和自由市场的左派。
Like Tsipras, both were elected in the midst of an economic crisis.	与齐普拉斯类似，金大中和卢拉都在经济危机中当选总统。
Both immediately confronted the international financial constraints that opposition politicians can afford to ignore.	两人上任伊始便面临着反对派政客才能忽视是国际金融约束。
On assuming power, Kim and Lula were able to adjust, politically and mentally, to the new realities that confronted them, launching much-needed reforms.	掌握了权力的金大中和卢拉能够从政治上和思想上做出调整以适应他们所面临的现实，启动急需的改革。
Some reforms were “conservative” (or “neo-liberal”) and might not have been possible under politicians of the right.	一些改革是“保守 ” （ 或“新自由主义 ” ） 的，绝不可能在右派政客手中实行。
But others were consistent with their lifetime commitments.	但其他改革与他们一生的承诺一致。
South Korea under Kim began to rein in the chaebols, the country’s huge family-owned conglomerates.	金大中治下的韩国开始遏制财阀（家族所有的巨型企业集团 ） 。
Brazil under Lula implemented Bolsa Familia, a system of direct cash payments to households that is credited with lifting millions out of poverty.	卢拉治下的把戏实施了家庭补助金（Bolsa Familia）计划，该计划向家庭直接派发现金，将数百万人带出了贫困。
Tsipras and his Syriza party, however, spent their first six months in office still blinkered about financial realities, unable to see things from the perspective of others.	但是，齐普拉斯和他的左翼联盟党（Syriza）执政已经六个月，却仍没有看清金融现实，无法借助他人的角度看待问题。
The decision to hold a referendum on the bailout terms set by Greece’s creditors showed that they were politically blinkered as well.	就希腊债权人所要求的条件进行公投的决定表明，他们在政治上也没有认清现实。
If Tsipras were reading from a normal script, he would logically have asked Greeks to vote yes.	如果齐普拉斯从常理出发，合乎逻辑的做法是要求希腊人民投赞成票。
But he asked them to vote no, which they did by a surprisingly wide margin.	但他要求希腊人民投反对票，并出人意料地获得了绝大多数人的顺从。
He evidently thought that this would strengthen his hand; instead, it merely strengthened the position of those Germans convinced that the time had come to let Greece drop out of the euro.	他显然认为这将加强他的立场；相反，这仅仅加强了那些认为是时候让希腊退出欧元区的德国人的立场。
Only a week after the referendum, Tsipras finally faced up to reality: Greece’s euro partners are not prepared to offer easier terms.	公投后不过一周，齐普拉斯终于开始面对现实：希腊的欧元伙伴国不准备向它提供更加容易的条件。
On the contrary, they are insisting on more extensive concessions as the price of a third bailout.	相反，它们坚持希腊做出更大的让步换取第三轮援助。
The only possible silver lining to this sorry history is that some of Tsipras’s supporters at home may now be willing to swallow the creditors’ bitter medicine.	这段悲哀历史的唯一一个闪光点是一些齐普拉斯的国内支持者现在也许愿意吞下债权人的苦口良药。
One should not underestimate the opposition that reforms continue to face among Greeks.	你不应该低估改革在希腊人中间所继续面临的反对。
But like Kim and Lula, Tsipras could marshal political support from some on the left who reckon, “If he now says that these measures are unavoidable, there truly must be no alternative.”	但与金大中和卢拉一样，齐普拉斯可以从一些认为“如果他现在说这些措施不可避免，那么确实是别无选择了”的左派中赢得政治支持。
(The same thing has of course happened on the right: Only Nixon could go to China.)	（同样的事情当然也在右派身上发生过：只有尼克松可能去中国。 ）
None of this is to say that the international financial realities a country faces are necessarily always reasonable.	所有这些都不是说一国所面临的国际金融现实永远是合理的。
Sometimes global financial markets’ eagerness to lend results in unreasonable booms, followed by abrupt reversals.	有时全球金融市场急切地想要贷款，结果导致非理性的繁荣，随之而来的急转直下。
Foreign creditor governments can be unreasonable as well.	外部债权人政府也有可能不理性。
The misperceptions and errors by leaders in Germany and other creditor countries have been as damaging as those on the part of the less-experienced Greek leaders.	德国和其他债权国领导人的误解和错误与经验欠缺的希腊领导人的误解和错误一样危险。
For example, the belief that fiscal austerity raises income, rather than lowering it, even in the short run, was a mistake, as was the refusal in 2010 to write down the debt.	比如，认为财政紧缩增加而不是降低了收入（哪怕是短期收入）就是一个错误，2010年拒绝减记债务亦然。
These mistakes explain why Greece’s debt/GDP ratio is even higher today than it was then.	这些错误解释了为何今天的希腊债务/GDP之比比当时还要高。
Each side’s refusal to admit its mistakes reinforced the other side’s stubbornness.	各方都拒绝承认错误，这让另一方更加顽固。
The Germans would have done better to admit that fiscal austerity is contractionary in the short run.	德国人如果能够承认财政紧缩在短期引起衰退，就能做出更好的选择。
The Greeks would have done better to admit that democracy does not mean that one country’s people can vote to give themselves other countries’ money.	希腊如果承认民主并不意味着一国人民可以让自己获得其他国家的钱，也可以做得更好。
In terms of game theory, the fact that the Greeks and Germans have different economic interests is not enough to explain the poor outcome of negotiations to date.	用博弈论的话说，希腊人和德国人经济利益不同，这一事实不足以解释到目前为止的糟糕的谈判结果。
The difference in perceptions has been central.	感觉的不同是核心问题。
“Getting to yes” in a bargaining situation requires that the negotiators not only have a clear idea of their own top priorities, but also that they understand what the other side wants most.	在讨价还价局面中“形成一致”要求谈判者不但清楚地明白自身的当务之急，还要求他们理解对方最想要什么。
A “bad bargain” would call on each side to forego its top priorities.	“坏讨价还价”要求各方放弃最重要的重点。
The European Central Bank should not have to agree to an explicit write-down of Greek debt.	欧洲央行不应该同意直接减记希腊债务。
And Greece should not have to run a substantial primary budget surplus for now.	希腊也不应该现在保持巨大的初级预算盈余。
Under a relatively “good bargain,” the creditors would modify interest rates and extend maturities further, as the International Monetary Fund now suggests, so that Greece does not have to pay the unpayable over the coming years, in exchange for growth-enhancing structural reforms.	在相对较“好的讨价还价”中，债权人应该如IMF现在所建议的那样调整利率并进一步延长期限，以使希腊不必在未来几年中偿付它无力偿付的金额来换取加强增长所需要的结构改革。
One hopes that the awful experience of the last six months has led both sides to a clearer perception of economic realities and priorities.	我们希望过去六个月的糟糕经验让双方都对经济现实和当务之急有了更清晰的认识。
This will be necessary if the two sides are to arrive at a good bargain, rather than a bad one – or even an outright failure to cooperate, so that Greece effectively drops out of the euro.	如果双方想形成好的而不是坏的讨价还价（甚至彻底的合作失败，从而导致希腊事实退出欧元区 ） ， 这是必要条件。
A recurrent theme of the Greek crisis since it erupted in late 2009 is that both the Greeks and the eurozone’s creditor countries have been reluctant to consider lessons from previous emerging-market crises.	自2009年爆发以来，希腊危机的一个反复出现的主题���希腊人和欧元区债权国不愿从此前的新兴市场危机中汲取经验。
After all, they said, Greece was a eurozone member, not a developing country.	他们说，毕竟希腊是欧元区成员国而不是发展中国家。
That is why, for example, the ECB and European Commission initially did not want Greece to go to the IMF and did not want to write down Greek debt.	因此 ， （ 比如）欧洲央行和欧盟委员会最初不愿意让希腊求助IMF，也不愿减记希腊债务。
Emerging market crises do hold important lessons.	新兴市场危机确实可以提供重要经验。
If Tsipras can now follow the course taken by Kim and Lula, he will serve his country well.	如果齐普拉斯可以效仿金大中和卢拉，将给希腊带来巨大的好处。
	
How Kim Has Played Trump	金正恩如何玩弄特朗普
ATLANTA – North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is eager to hold a second summit with US President Donald Trump.	亚特兰大—朝鲜领导人金正恩急切地想和美国总统特朗普举行第二次峰会。
Since their first meeting in Singapore in June, Kim has consistently outmaneuvered his counterpart.	自6月份在新加坡第一次会面以来，金正恩一直智胜特朗普。
Trump may still fancy himself a world-class dealmaker, but the truth is that Kim – like Russian President Vladimir Putin – has got Trump’s number.	特朗普可能仍自我陶醉地认为他是世界级交易者，但真相是金正恩 — — 就像俄罗斯总统普京 — — 早已看穿了特朗普的底牌。
Kim’s bonhomie (real or feigned) and promises of denuclearization have muted Trump’s threats, brought the South Korean government closer to his side, and eroded international sanctions against his regime.	金正恩的亲和姿态（不管是真的还是装的）和去核化承诺让悄然化解了特朗普的威胁，拉近了韩国政府，并影响到针对其政权的国际制裁。
Kim has accomplished all of this without diminishing his regime’s nuclear capacity, and he appears to have continued ballistic-missile development at 16 hidden sites.	金正恩在达成所有这些成果的同时，丝毫没有削弱其核实力，他可能继续在16个秘密基地继续着弹道导弹的开发。
Having gone from nuclear-armed pariah to presidential negotiating partner, it is little wonder that Kim would want a second summit to consolidate his newfound international legitimacy and position in the global limelight.	从拥有核武器的贱民，到与总统谈笑风生，毫不奇怪金正恩想要第二次峰会以巩固他新获得的国际合法性以及在全球舞台上的地位。
Kim has already outdone his forebears.	金正恩已经超过了他的先人。
His father and grandfather both tried and failed to create a high-level channel to the US government.	他的父亲和祖父都试图与美国政府建立高规格沟通渠道，但都失败了。
The relationship that Kim has forged with Trump is thus an historic and personal success.	因此，金正恩构建的与特朗普的关系是历史性的、个人的成功。
After six reclusive years in power, the 35-year-old scion of North Korea’s dynastic regime has made a remarkable debut on the world stage, both managing an erratic, ego-driven president and setting the terms of the negotiations.	在经过了六年不露声色的统治后，这位朝鲜政权王朝接班人在世界舞台上粉墨登场，不但治住了一位翻覆自我的总统，还确定了谈判条件。
By contrast, the Trump administration has little to show for its efforts.	相反，特朗普政府几乎没有什么拿得出手的成绩。
Since the Singapore summit, US officials have reportedly been pushing the Kim regime to lay out a path to denuclearization.	自新加坡峰会以来，据说美国官员敦促金氏政权拿出去核化路线图。
But the North Koreans have refused to turn over even the most basic facts about their arsenal.	但朝鲜人拒绝交代关于他们的武器的哪怕是最基本的事实。
This stonewalling suggests that Kim has read Trump well.	如此顽固表明金正恩看透了特朗普。
As Trump himself contends, “I am the only one that matters.”	正如特朗普本人所说 ， “ 我就是唯一的重要因素 。 ”
Trump’s narcissism, hunger for the spotlight, and desperation to match former President Barack Obama’s Nobel Peace Prize are all that Kim needs to know about the man.	特朗普的自恋、对曝光的渴望，以及对能够与前前总统奥巴马的诺贝尔和平奖相提并论的急切之心，便是金正恩所需要了解的一切。
The only question is how far Trump will go to secure something that he can hawk as an unprecedented deal with North Korea.	唯一的问题是特朗普能够拿出什么来确保他能够吹嘘为前所未有的对朝协议。
By agreeing to another summit while slow-rolling preliminary talks, Kim is reconnoitering Trump’s bottom line.	通过同意再次举行峰会，同时慢条斯理地地准备预备会谈，金正恩在试探特朗普的底线。
Recall that, as its up-front price for serious denuclearization talks, the North initially pushed for diplomatic steps, such as a treaty to end to the Korean War.	不要忘了，作为严肃去核化谈判的先期条件，最初是朝鲜提出了外交方案，比如朝鲜战争停战条约。
In Singapore, Trump promised to do just that, surprising American allies and US officials alike.	在新加坡，特朗普承诺就要这样做，另美国的盟友和美国官员大吃一惊。
Then, in talks last month with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Kim upped the ante by also calling for an end to the international sanctions against his regime.	接着，在上个月与美国国务卿蓬佩奥的会谈中，金正恩由提高了赌注，要求结束针对其政权的制裁。
No doubt, Kim is hoping that Trump’s impulsiveness will lead him to fold.	毫无疑问，金正恩希望特朗普的冲动会让他就范。
This month, Kim’s foreign ministry issued a public threat that North Korea could restart its weapons program if the US does not soften its position on sanctions.	本业，金正恩的外交部长公开威胁说，如果美国不软化在制裁问题上的立场，朝鲜可能重启武器计划。
As Pompeo pursues further talks in Pyongyang this month, Kim will surely hold his ground.	当蓬佩奥寻求这个月在平壤进行进一步谈判时，金正恩肯定会坚持自己的要求。
Since declaring in June that North Korea is “no longer a nuclear threat”, Trump has backpedaled on virtually all of his demands, dropped his draconian deadlines, and failed even to hint that Kim’s foot-dragging is a cause for concern.	自6月份宣布朝鲜“不再是一个核威胁”以来，特朗普收回了几乎全部要求，取消了严苛的最后期限，甚至都不表态金正恩的拖拉值得关注。
In October, Pompeo made no headway toward defining even the basic vocabulary of a future agreement.	10月份，蓬佩奥在未来协定的基本要件方面毫无进展。
According to officials who are familiar with the talks, on at least two occasions, the North Koreans asked him if he wanted to step out and call his boss.	据熟悉谈判的官员透露，至少有两次，朝鲜人问他是否想出去给上司打个电话。
As matters stand, the Kim regime and the US have yet to agree on the definition of terms such as “denuclearization,” “verifiable,” and “irreversible.”	目前的情况是，金氏政权和美国尚未就“去核化 ” 、 “可核实”和“不可逆”等术语的定义达成一致。
To be sure, playing Trump and reneging on promised steps toward denuclearization has its risks.	平心而论，玩弄特朗普、食言承诺的去核化举措自有其风险。
In May, Trump temporarily canceled the Singapore meeting in response to North Korean statements, and he did the same with talks between Pompeo and the North Koreans in August.	5月份，特朗普因为朝鲜的言论而临时取消了新加坡挥舞，对于8月份蓬佩奥和朝鲜人的谈判，他也这么做了。
There is no guarantee that he will not repeat that gambit.	不能保证他不会再重复这一伎俩。
And yet, even if he does, Kim’s own penchant for drama – from firing missiles over Japan to carrying out frequent purges at home – suggests that he knows how to command the stage and bring Trump to the table.	但是，即使他这么做了，金正恩自身的戏剧偏好 — — 从向日本发射火箭到国内的频繁清洗 — — 表明他长袖善舞，知道如何让特朗普坐在谈判桌前。
Moreover, his ego-stroking personal letters to Trump show that he has a good fix on the president’s psyche.	此外，他给特朗普的奉承的个人信件表明他很能把握总统的心理。
So far, he has proved to be highly effective at keeping the bromance alive, and the forthcoming summit on track.	目前，他十分善于保持这一“兄弟情 ” ， 让下一次峰会箭在弦上。
Regardless of when the second summit occurs, the North Korean regime will continue to reap dividends at America’s expense in the meantime.	无论第二次峰会何时举行，朝鲜政权都会继续将成果建立在美国的损失之上。
Trump’s cancellation of two major US-South Korean joint military exercises already has commanders from both countries worried about their military readiness.	特朗普取消了两次美韩重要军演已经让两国的将军们担心备战情况。
And international support for economic sanctions – particularly on the part of China and Russia – has been steadily eroding since even before the Singapore summit.	而经济制裁的国际支持 — — 特别是中国和俄罗斯的支持 — — 自新加坡峰会以来也在稳步削弱。
With a fourth 2018 summit between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in now in the works, it is clear that Moon’s political future is tied to rapprochement.	2018年金正恩与韩国总统文在寅之间的第四次峰会眼看就要举行，显然文在寅的政治前途系于和朝鲜改善关系。
During his October trip to Europe, Moon lobbied hard for the easing of sanctions, reflecting his government’s desire to engage, not embargo, the North.	在其10月份的欧洲之行中，文在寅竭力游说放松制裁，表明其政府渴望与朝鲜交往而非封杀。
It is time for the self-described master of the “art of the deal” to admit that he doesn’t have one.	自封的“交易的艺术”大师应该承认，他根本没有什么交易的艺术。
Trump prefers hype to the hard work of hammering out arms-control agreements, so controlling his craving for the spotlight will not be easy.	特朗普更喜欢大肆宣传而非下苦功夫促成军备控制协议，因此要控制他的曝光欲望绝非易事。
Nonetheless, when it comes to Kim, a bit of 54-year-old wisdom from Barry Goldwater, another outsider-turned-Republican Party icon, still applies: “The only summit meeting that can succeed is the one that doesn’t take place.”	尽管如此，对于金正恩，巴里·戈德华特 — — 另一位局外人转变而来的共和党标志性人物 — — 54年前的智慧仍然成立 ： “ 唯一有可能成功的峰会是没有开成的峰会 。 ”
	
Getting to Yes With Kim Jong-un	与金正恩会面
SEOUL – Has North Korea’s ruler, Kim Jong-un, made a strategic decision to trade away his nuclear program, or is he just engaged in another round of deceptive diplomacy, pretending that he will denuclearize in exchange for material benefits for his impoverished country?	首尔 — — 朝鲜统治者金正恩是否作出了放弃核计划的战略决定，抑或他仅仅是在展开又一轮的外交欺骗，假装要以无核化为条件换取物质利益以挽救朝鲜的贫困？
This is, perhaps, the key question in the run-up to the summit between Kim and US President Donald Trump in Singapore on June 12.	这或许是6月12日金正恩与美国总统唐纳德·特朗普在新加坡举行首脑会晤之前的关键点。
Until then, no one will know the answer, perhaps not even Kim himself.	直到谜底揭晓，没有人，甚至包括金正恩本人在内，能够知晓答案。
Optimists tend to believe that Kim’s declared intention to denuclearize is sincere.	乐观主义者倾向于认为金宣布无核化不乏诚意。
They highlight the fact that North Korea’s economy has changed fundamentally since he succeeded his father, Kim Jong-il, in 2011.	他们强调自2011年他接替其父金正日以来，朝鲜经济已经发生了根本性的变化。
It is now more open, with foreign trade accounting for almost half of GDP, the result of a gradual marketization process that began in the mid-1990s.	朝鲜经济现在更加开放，外贸几乎占到GDP的一半，这是金在20世纪90年代中期逐渐推进市场化进程的结果。
But with this openness comes vulnerability, which explains Kim’s active diplomatic efforts to prevent serious economic disruption from the existing international sanctions regime.	但开放的朝鲜经济也更加脆弱，这解释了金为什么愿意付出积极的外交努力，以防止现有的国际制裁机制对朝鲜经济造成严重破坏。
Unlike his father, the 34-year-old Kim has been active in pursuing pro-market economic growth and may be aiming to emulate Deng Xiaoping, the architect of China’s reforms in the late 1970s.	与其父不同，34岁的金正恩一直积极寻求以市场为导向的经济增长，他或许以模仿20世纪70年代后期中国改革开放的总设计师邓小平为目标。
Kim’s recent sacking of three senior old-guard military officials may hint that he is ready to offer some important concessions to prepare a favorable diplomatic environment for concentrating on economic development.	金最近解雇了三名资深的护卫军官可能暗示他为营造对经济发展有利的外交环境准备做出某些重要让步。
The key question remains whether Trump is now ready to embrace Kim’s North Korea as President Richard Nixon did with Deng’s China.	但关键问题依然是特朗普是否做好准备像理查德·尼克松总统接纳邓小平的中国一样接纳金正恩的朝鲜。
Pessimists, however, caution against believing that Kim is serious about denuclearization.	相反，悲观主义者警告不要相信金的无核化。
There is so far no evidence, they argue, that Kim is different from his father (and grandfather, Kim Il-sung), when it comes to adhering to international agreements.	他们认为，迄今为止，没有证据表明金正恩在遵守国际协议方面与他的父亲（及其祖父金日成）有任何不同。
They are skeptical, for example, that North Korea will cooperate fully on three major issues.	例如，他们怀疑朝鲜能否就三大问题进行充分合作。
First, despite Kim’s declaration, it remains unclear whether he is agreeing to “complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantlement” (CVID) of North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.	首先，尽管发表了声明，但尚不清楚金正恩是否同意“完全、可核查及不可逆转地（CVID）废除”朝鲜的核武计划。
His commitment remains aspirational and lacks substance or operational content.	他的承诺仍然停留在希望层面，缺乏实际或可操作的内容。
Second, given North Korea’s bad track record, the pessimists think it unlikely that Kim will permit intrusive nuclear inspections, which is a critical component of CVID.	其次，鉴于朝鲜过往的不良记录，悲观主义者认为金不太可能批准进行完全、可核查及不可逆转的无核化所不可或缺的侵入式核检查。
Finally, North Korea has not yet clarified the terms of its denuclearization.	最后，朝鲜尚未澄清其无核化条件。
Its past official position – withdrawal of US troops from South Korea and an end to the bilateral alliance, would be a non-starter.	朝鲜过去的官方立场 — — 要求美国从韩国撤军并中止两国双边联盟，根本就没有成功的希望。
But there may be a way to achieve denuclearization that satisfies both optimists and pessimists.	但仍然有可能以一种乐观主义者和悲观主义者都能满意的方式实现朝鲜无核化。
To find it requires taking a step back and considering the most fundamental reason for the diplomatic failures of the last three decades: the high level of mutual distrust, which has made a small and weak country like North Korea, surrounded by big powers, paranoid about its own security.	找到这种方式需要双方都后退一步，认真思考一下过去30年外交失败的最根本的理由：美朝高度缺乏互信，导致像朝鲜这样的弱小国家在大国的包围下，陷入对自身安全偏执的忧虑中而无法自拔。
In order to address this problem at the root, the US should have taken a political approach, rather than focusing repeatedly on concluding a narrowly defined military-security deal.	为从根本上解决这一问题，美国应当采取政治手段，而不是一再以达成狭隘的军事安全协议为目标。
For example, President George H.W. Bush’s administration declined North Korea’s offer to establish diplomatic relations in 1991-92, when the fall of the Soviet Union heightened Kim Il-sung’s sense of insecurity.	例如，老布什总统政府拒绝了朝鲜在1991到92年间提出的美朝建交提议，当时苏联的垮台致使金日成的不安全感增加。
Likewise, North Korea’s major complaint regarding the October 1994 Geneva Agreed Framework was that the US did not keep its promise to improve political relations with North Korea.	同样，朝鲜对1994年10月日内瓦协议框架主要的不满在于美国并未兑现与朝鲜改善政治关系的承诺。
The Clinton administration tried a political approach in 2000, but it was too little too late.	克林顿政府曾在2000年时尝试以政治方式解决，但这样的工作太少也太迟了。
The first Trump-Kim summit may not be able to resolve all three major issues dividing the US and North Korea all at once.	首次特金会可能无法一次性解决美朝间存在的三个主要问题。
But that does not mean the summit will be a failure.	但这并不意味着峰会注定无法逃脱失败的结果。
For the first time, the US is tackling the fundamental cause of the North Korea problem, rather than focusing on its symptoms.	有史以来首次，美国正试图解决朝鲜问题的根本原因，而不是把注意力集中在表象。
And this is why Trump’s seemingly impromptu decision to meet Kim face to face is meaningful and productive, especially if he can bolster Kim’s confidence that he and his regime will be safe without nuclear weapons and that the international community will help him to focus on economic growth.	这解释了为什么特朗普与金正恩面对面会晤的即兴决定意义深远且富有成效，尤其如果他能借此增强金正恩的信心，让金正恩相信他和他的政权在没有核武器的情况下也是安全的，而国际社会将会帮他专注于经济增长。
That said, Trump would be well advised to leave the details of the denuclearization process in the hands of diplomats who have much experience in dealing with North Korea.	也就是说，特朗普将无核化进程的细节交由与朝鲜打交道有丰富经验的外交人员处理将是明智的决策。
In the meantime, he will need to rebuild an international coalition to maintain effective economic sanctions, which is the most powerful leverage for persuading Kim to accept CVID.	与此同时，他需要重建国际联盟来维持有效的经济制裁，这是说服金正恩接受完全、可验证及不可逆转的无核化的最有效的筹码。
Here, close cooperation with China will be essential.	在此，与中国保持密切合作至关重要。
Moreover, the US should reward critical concessions by North Korea – for example, permission to conduct intrusive inspections of its entire nuclear program by international inspectors – even before the completion of CVID.	此外，美国应当鼓励朝鲜做出关键让步 — — 例如，甚至是在完全、可验证及不可逆转的无核化完成之前，允许国际核查人员对其整个核计划展开侵入性核查。
There are of course no guarantees that it will work.	当然，无法确保这样的举措将会取得成功。
What is clear is that successful denuclearization of North Korea will require a combination of bold political decisions – say, formally ending the Korean War, opening liaison offices, or relaxing some economic sanctions – and realistic prudence.	显而易见的是，朝鲜成功无核化将需要大胆的政治决策 — — 比如正式结束朝鲜战争、开设联络处或者放松某些经济制裁 — — 以及务实的谨慎。
	
What Sank the Kim-Trump Summit?	金正恩特朗普峰会破裂的理由？
CANBERRA – When US President Donald Trump abruptly canceled his summit with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un, he blamed “tremendous anger and open hostility” from the North.	堪培拉 — — 当美国总统唐纳德·特朗普突然取消与朝鲜领导人金正恩的首脑会晤，他将原因归咎于朝鲜的公开敌意和巨大愤怒。
In fact, the summit, scheduled for June 12 in Singapore, was doomed for three reasons.	事实上，这场原定于6月12日在新加坡举行的峰会注定失败的理由主要有三个。
First, the two sides mirrored each other’s misperception of the main motivation for the summit.	首先，双方都误解了对方参与首脑会晤的主要动机。
Both thought the other had agreed to meet because of weakness and had made major concessions.	双方都认为对方同意会面是因为软弱并已做出重大让步。
Kim believed that his nuclear strength had forced Trump to the summit without preconditions, making him Trump’s equal as a head of state.	金正恩相信其核力量迫使特朗普在不设先决条件的情况下参与会面，因此他可以作为与特朗普对等的国家元首进行会晤。
He could afford to explore possible avenues for a peace regime, he thought, because North Korea’s nuclear sword provided immunity from US attacks.	于是他认为自己有资格探索可能的和平机制，因为核武器能确保朝鲜免于成为美国的攻击对象。
But the Americans concluded that international sanctions had brought North Korea to its knees, leaving Kim desperate to conclude a deal on US terms.	但美国人却认为国际制裁已经迫使朝鲜屈服，金正恩正绝望地想要按照美国开出的条件达成协议。
Part of the US strategy was to place additional pressure on China to rein in its client state or itself face tough financial penalties from Washington.	美国的部分策略是向中国施压要求其控制好自己的附庸国，不然中国自己就要面对华盛顿严厉的金融惩罚措施。
South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in, who deserves the most credit for recent developments on the Korean Peninsula, unwittingly stoked this misperception by attributing his summit with Kim to Trump’s policy of “maximum pressure” on the North.	为近期朝鲜半岛局势发展做出最大贡献的韩国总统文在寅无意之中强化了这种误解，因为他将与金正恩的首脑会晤归功于特朗普对朝鲜的“最大压力”政策发挥了作用。
This was calculated flattery on Moon’s part.	从文在寅的角度看这不过是有意的奉承。
By validating Trump’s self-serving belief that tough sanctions bend countries to America’s will, Moon gained political cover from US foreign-policy hawks unhappy about diplomatic overtures to Kim.	因为证明了特朗普所谓强硬制裁能使他国屈从于美国意志的自私自利的理念，文在寅赢得了无法容忍对金氏政权做出任何外交提案的美国外交政策鹰派人士的政治掩护。
Unfortunately, endorsement of this narrative emboldened the US hardliners now surrounding Trump to prevail upon him to exit the Iran nuclear deal.	不幸的是，对这种说法的认可鼓舞了目前围绕在特朗普周围的美国强硬派，诱使特朗普废除伊核协议的内容。
To Kim, who expects to rule for decades, the reinstatement of US sanctions against Iran signaled that a deal concluded with one administration could be canceled without penalty by the next.	在未来数十年仍将继续掌权的金正恩看来，美国重新对伊朗实施制裁意味着下一届美国政府可以在不受任何惩罚的情况下推翻上一届政府达成的协议。
To China (and Russia), it signaled the futility of falling in line with US demands against an ally and the pointlessness of engaging in tough multi-party negotiations over several years.	而在中国和俄罗斯看来，这表明在美国的要求下进行反对盟国之举完全徒劳无益，而且参与长达数年的多边谈判也毫无意义。
To the rest of the world, it highlighted America’s growing international isolation.	而在世界其他国家看来，这凸显了美国越来越孤立的国际态度。
The second reason for the summit’s cancellation was contradictory understandings of “denuclearization” – the single most critical issue in the entire episode.	峰会取消的第二个原因是对无核化矛盾的理解 — — 在整个过程中仅有这个问题是最关键的。
The US, believing Kim had buckled under pressure, understood this to mean achievement of its long-sought goal of “CVID”: complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea.	美国认为金正恩因为压力而屈服，因此将其理解为美国长期追求的完全、可核查及不可逆转的无核化（即CVID）目标的实现。
The North, mistakenly concluding that its nuclear deterrent had brought Trump to the summit, believed it was on the cusp of achieving its own long-sought goal: a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula, including an end to the US nuclear umbrella for Japan and South Korea.	而朝鲜则错误地认为其核威慑力迫使特朗普参加峰会，并因此认为自己长期追求的目标即将实现：那就是实现朝鲜半岛无核化，包括终结美国为日本和韩国提供核保护伞。
If it played its cards right, it could even end the US alliance with South Korea and Japan, with all US troops withdrawing from East Asia.	如果筹码运用得当，甚至可以终结美国与韩国及日本的联盟状态，甚至实现从东亚撤出所有美国军队。
Because the US misread Kim’s primary motivation and expectations, it ran into a third problem – in fact a trap of its own making, from which there was no escape.	因为美国误解了金正恩的主要动机和期望，它遇到第三个问题就不可避免 — — 这个问题实际是它自己制造而且无法逃避的陷阱。
The North Koreans made it abundantly clear that they understood what can happen to regimes that pick fights with America without having the ultimate weapon.	朝鲜已明确表示他们非常了解不掌握终极武器的国家与美国对垒将会得到什么样的结果。
They were very conscious of what happened to Slobodan Milošević, Saddam Hussein, and Muammar el-Qaddafi.	他们非常清楚斯洛博丹·米洛舍维奇、萨达姆·侯赛因和穆阿迈尔·卡扎菲的结果。
And the example of Qaddafi turned out to be especially important.	而其中卡扎菲的例子显得尤为重要。
After abandoning his quest for nuclear weapons in exchange for normalization of relations with the US and the world, Qaddafi died a horrible death (during which he was tortured and sodomized with a bayonet).	在放弃研发核武器以换取实现与美国和全球关系正常化之后，卡扎菲的下场是恐怖的死亡（死时他受尽刺刀的折磨 ） 。
And then, on April 30, Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, made the incendiary suggestion that North Korea could follow the “Libya model” of denuclearization.	而后在4月30日，特朗普的国家安全顾问约翰·博尔顿提出了煽动性的建议，即要求朝鲜无核化遵循“利比亚模式 ” 。
Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye-gwan delivered the North’s furious response: “We do not hide our feeling of repugnance toward him.”	金桂冠外相代表朝鲜给出了愤怒的回复 ： “ 我们毫不掩饰对博尔顿的厌恶 。 ”
The North was not interested in a dialogue aimed at a coerced “unilateral nuclear abandonment.”	朝鲜对旨在强迫“单方面弃核”的对话不感兴趣。
The “world knows too well that our country is neither Libya nor Iraq, which have met miserable fates.”	“全世界都知道我们的国家既不是利比亚也不是伊拉克，这两个国家所遭遇的下场都是非常悲惨的 。 ”
Although Trump distanced himself from Bolton’s remarks, Vice President Mike Pence warned three weeks later that if North Korea did not make a deal, it would indeed meet with Libya’s fate.	尽管特朗普与博尔顿的言论划清了界限，但副总统迈克·彭斯却在三周后警告如果朝鲜未能达成协议，利比亚的命运就会发生在朝鲜身上。
Choe Son Hui, vice minister of foreign affairs, replied by threatening a “nuclear-to-nuclear showdown” if Washington stuck to “unlawful and outrageous” belligerence.	而朝鲜副外长崔善熙则威胁进行“核摊牌 ” ， 如果华盛顿拒不放弃其“非法而无耻的”好战态度。
So what happens next?	下一步将会发生什么？
If North Korea resumes nuclear and long-range missile tests, Trump, whose instinct is to escalate the rhetoric of conflict, will come under pressure to respond forcefully.	如果朝鲜恢复核及远程导弹试验，那么本能的反应是升级冲突言论的特朗普将会面临作出强硬反应的巨大压力。
Amid a re-run of last year’s lurid schoolyard taunts – “little rocket man” and “mentally deranged dotard” – Moon will be desperate to rescue a semblance of improvement in relations with the North.	如果去年嘲笑对方为“小火箭人”和“精神错乱的老糊涂”那样戏剧性的校园口水战再次上演 — — 文在寅将竭尽全力挽救与朝鲜改善关系的工作。
Kim could try to drive a deep wedge between South Korea and the US.	而金正恩则可能进一步试图分裂美韩。
Japan’s hardline Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is probably relieved that the summit has been called off.	日本强硬派首相安倍晋三很可能会因为峰会取消而长出一口气。
The best the rest of the world can hope for is that, however slim the prospects, a diplomatic process will be maintained, along with channels of clear, accurate communication.	世界其他国家的最高期望是无论前景多么黯淡，有清晰准确沟通渠道的外交进程将会得以持续。
A modest goal would be to reach an agreement to keep North Korea’s nuclear and missile program at current levels of capability.	相对合理的目标是达成一份协议，使朝鲜的核及导弹计划保持在目前的能力水平而不继续升级。
But the US may have cornered itself by rejecting such a cap with respect to Iran.	但美国拒绝为伊朗核问题设置上限的做法或许已经将自己逼进了死胡同。
Having made the perfect the enemy of the good in the Middle East, the Trump administration will find it humiliating to agree to a comparable arrangement on the Korean Peninsula.	因为在中东完美地扮演了善良的死敌，特朗普政府会因为在朝鲜半岛达成类似协议而感到屈辱。
For Trump, the art of breaking deals is more important.	对特朗普而言，更重要的或许是破坏交易的艺术。
	
Could the Trump-Kim Summit Succeed?	“金特会”能成功吗？
CANBERRA – Last year, North Korea’s Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump were hurling kindergarten insults at each other – “Rocket Man is on a suicide mission,” said Trump of Kim; “mentally deranged US dotard,” Kim retorted – while threatening to reduce East Asia to a post-atomic wasteland.	堪培拉—去年，朝鲜的金正恩和美国总统特朗普像稚童那样互相攻讦 — — “火箭人正在执行自杀任务 ， ” 特朗普说金正恩 ； “ 丧心病狂的美国老糊涂 ， ” 金正恩回击 — — 差点让东亚遭到核夷平。
Now, in a stunning and dramatic development, the two are to meet by May.	如今，情况发生了令人咋舌的戏剧性变化，两人要在5月会面。
Kim reportedly is willing to denuclearize and eager to talk directly to Trump, who has agreed.	据说金正恩准备去核，渴望直接和特朗普对话。 而特朗普答应了他。
But optimism about this turn of events must be tempered with cautious realism.	但如果你对局势的转变充满乐观的话，请你务必保持谨慎的现实主义。
North Korea is the nuclear problem from hell.	朝鲜是来自地狱的核问题。
Neither South Korea nor the United States can control the narrative; definitions of success or failure are highly relative; and Trump must enter the talks with no exit strategy.	朝鲜和美国都无法控制叙事（narrative ） ， 成功还是失败，都只能从相对角度判断；而特朗普进入谈判时肯定没有退出策略。
The six decades since the Korean War ended in 1953 – with a ceasefire but no peace agreement – have hardened an increasingly dangerous stalemate.	自1953年朝鲜战争结束六十年来 — — 停战但没有签订和平协定 — — 日益危险的僵局越来越难以打破。
Although neither side is likely to launch a premeditated nuclear attack, the risk of war from miscommunication, misperception, or miscalculation is real.	尽管双方都不可能发动预谋的核打击，但因为沟通不畅、错觉或误判而导致战争的风险是实实在在的。
All key announcements so far have come from Seoul, not Pyongyang or Washington.	到目前为止，所有重要消息都来自首尔，而不是平壤或华盛顿。
President Moon Jae-in, a son of refugees from North Korea, was elected on the promise of a two-track approach to the North: sanctions and diplomacy.	韩国总统、朝鲜难民之子文在寅凭借针对朝鲜的双轨方针 — — 制裁加外交而当选。
This led to the Olympic initiative whereby Kim’s sister, Kim Yo-jong, attended the Winter Games in Pyeongchang, and the two countries competed as one team.	因此，金正恩的妹妹金与正出席了平昌冬奥会，两国还组成一支队伍参赛。
Afterwards, Moon’s national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, and intelligence chief Suh Hoon traveled to Pyongyang and Washington, where, standing on the White House lawn with Cho Yoon-je, South Korea’s ambassador to the US – but with no US officials present – they announced the summit.	奥运会后，文在寅的国家安保室长郑义溶和国家情报院院长徐薰访问了平壤和华盛顿，在白宫草坪上与韩国驻美大使赵润济（但没有美国官员出席）一同宣布了金特会的消息。
North Korea conducted the first of six nuclear tests in 2006.	20016年，朝鲜发动了其六次核试验中的第一次。
The regime’s nuclear program has many components, and discussions could founder on what is to be proscribed, permitted, and reversed, and in exchange for what concessions by the US.	朝鲜政权的核计划有很多要素，在禁止什么、允许什么、保留什么、换取美国的什么让步等方面，都有可能令讨论夭折。
Will the deal require freezing North Korea’s capability at current levels, or complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization?	达成协议要求将朝鲜的核能力冻结在当前水平，还是要求完全、可查、不可撤销的去核化？
The answer will depend on North Korea’s motives in getting the bomb and agreeing to talk.	答案取决于朝鲜获得核弹和同意谈判的动机。
For the Kim regime, the main lesson from the fates of Slobodan Milošević, Saddam Hussein, and Muammar el-Qaddafi was that only nuclear weapons can neutralize US efforts at regime change.	对金氏政权来说，米洛舍维奇、萨达姆和卡扎菲的命运的主要教训是只有核武器能让美国不寻求颠覆政权。
But the US never attacked North Korea in the decades after 1953, when it clearly did not have the bomb.	但自1953年以来的几十年中，美国从未在朝鲜没有核弹的情况下攻击过朝鲜。
Conversely, the North’s growing nuclear capability provoked the US into quietly preparing for war while hoping to avert one.	相反，朝鲜不断强大的核实力促使美国一边悄然备战，一边希望避免战争。
Sanctions are an ineffective tool to force North Korea’s compliance with the UN’s demand that it give up nuclear weapons, and it could prove dangerous to conclude that their pain brought Kim to the talks.	制裁并非迫使朝鲜遵守联合国的要求 — — 放弃核武器的有效工具，认为制裁带来的阵痛就能让金正恩来到谈判桌前的观点是危险的。
Similarly, the threat of US military strikes did little to concentrate Kim’s mind: even Western analysts do not find that threat credible.	类似地，美国军事打击的威胁也没有引起金正恩多大的在乎：甚至连西方分析师也不认为这个威胁可信。
The US lacks the ability to identify, locate, and destroy all three categories of nuclear targets: warheads, bomb production infrastructure, and delivery vehicles.	美国不具备辨别、定位和摧毁所有三类核目标的能力：核弹头、核弹生产基础设施以及运载工具。
North Korea also has formidable conventional military capabilities, and estimates of human casualties could total as many as 25 million, depending on the types of weapons used, the geographical theater of the conflict, and the countries sucked into it.	朝鲜还拥有可怕的常规军力，估算的人员伤亡总数可能高达2,500万人，具体取决于使用哪种武器、冲突的地缘政治以及牵涉其中的国家。
In February, Moon said: “The United States needs to lower its bar for dialogue and the North, too, must show its willingness to denuclearize” as critical first steps.	2月份，文在寅说 ： “ 美国需要降低谈话门槛，朝鲜则必须表现出去核化的意愿 ” ， 这是关键的第一步。
The summit became possible because the US acceded to that counsel, turning its demand for denuclearization, which had previously been a precondition for talks, into a goal of negotiations.	峰会之所以成为可能，是因为美国接受了这一忠告，将去核化（此前一直是谈判的先决条件）从谈判要求变为谈判目标。
But Kim will not trust unilateral US guarantees.	但金正恩不会相信美国的单方面保证。
Therefore, any deal would require the support of China and Russia, economic and energy assistance from Japan and others, and endorsement by the UN Security Council.	因此，任何协议都需要中国和俄罗斯的支持、日本和其他国家的经济和能源援助，以及联合国安理会的认可。
China and Russia have welcomed news of the direct talks, but Japan is uneasy.	中国和俄罗斯对直接对话表示欢迎，但日本感到不安。
All parties will explore six elements of a deal that North Korea is seeking: a peace treaty to replace the 1953 armistice, comprehensive sanctions relief, an end to US-South Korea military exercises, diplomatic recognition, acceptance of North Korean space activities, and nuclear energy assistance.	所有各方都将探究朝鲜所寻求的六点协议要素：用和平条约取代1953年停战协议、全面放松制裁、停止美韩联合军演、获得外交承认、接受朝鲜的空间活动，以及核能援助。
The North must halt all nuclear and missile tests until the summit, and sanctions will remain in place.	朝鲜必须在峰会之前停止一切核和导弹试射，制裁则会照旧。
But will the US and South Korea suspend military exercises?	但美国和韩国会停止军事演习吗？
To North Korea, complete denuclearization means the withdrawal of US extended nuclear deterrence from the peninsula.	对朝鲜来说，完全去核化意味着美国必须从朝鲜半岛撤出其巨大的核威慑。
The Kim-Trump summit is an opportunity that will be difficult to seize and easy to squander.	金特会是一个很难把握但很容易流失的机会。
For example, if Trump decertifies the Iran nuclear deal on May 12, ahead of the summit, the move would almost certainly call into question America’s good faith and ability to honor negotiated international agreements.	比如，如果特朗普在3月12日（峰会前夕）撤销伊朗核协议，那么这一举动几乎肯定会让美国尊重议定国际协定的善意和能力受到质疑。
Moreover, there is the general matter of Trump’s ignorance, lack of foreign-policy experience, and the many unfilled posts in the US State Department.	此外，特朗普的无知、缺乏外交政策经验以及美国国务院大量职位空缺已成常态。
There is still no US ambassador in Seoul, and Joseph Yun, US Special Representative for North Korea Policy, retired this month.	至今美国仍没有任命驻首尔大使，而美国朝鲜政策特别代表尹汝尚（Joseph Yun）又在本月退休。
Without extensive diplomatic groundwork, the wily Kim could outsmart Trump.	在缺乏全面外交基础的情况下，狡猾的金正恩能够智胜特朗普。
Participation in the Winter Olympics and willingness to sit down with Trump have already given the North a propaganda boost, and a summit with the US president will confer legitimacy on Kim.	参加冬奥会和愿意坐下来和特朗普谈判让朝鲜获得了宣传优势，而与美国总统举行峰会将让金正恩获得合法性。
Yet Trump has proven to be pragmatic, not ideological.	但特朗普终究是个务实派，而非意识形态挂帅。
His transactional approach could prove the key.	他的交易型方针可能成为关键。
Whether genuine or tactical, Moon has constantly praised Trump’s tough stance of maximum pressure as helpful to gaining Kim’s interest in a possible diplomatic solution.	不管是出于肺腑还是故作姿态，文在寅始终赞扬特朗普保持最大的压力的强硬立场，认为这有助于让金正恩有兴趣寻求可能的外交解决方案。
Moreover, Trump carries no historical baggage, and his decisiveness, even if rooted in impulsiveness, could provide the necessary breakthrough to overcome decades of accumulated inertia.	此外，特朗普没有历史包袱，而他的果断 — — 即使这源自他的冲动 — — 能够形成必要的突破，克服几十年来所积累的惯性。
Trump’s ability to reverse himself and deny having done so could be equally advantageous.	特朗普否定自己、对已经做的事翻脸不认的也可能是一个优势。
If a good deal is on the table, nothing the US has done, or that Trump has said in the past, will stop him from seizing the moment.	一旦好协议摆上桌面，不管美国做了什么，也不管特朗普从前说过什么，都不会阻止他抓住机会。
On such slender threads of hope hang nuclear peace.	核和平的希望便是如此绵绵不绝如缕。
	
Kipling’s Wisdom	吉卜林的智慧
LONDON – The beginning of October marked the seventh anniversary of the beginning of the American-led bombardment of Afghanistan.	伦敦– 十月的开始标志着由美国领导的对阿富汗的轰炸已经过去了七年。
Seven years later, the Taliban are still fighting.	七年后，塔利班依然在战斗。
Some 50 insurgents died recently in an assault on Lashkar gar, the capital of Helmand province.	在最近一次对Helmand 省会Lashkar Gar的袭击中有大约50名叛乱者被击毙。
Osama bin Laden is nowhere to be found.	奥萨马·本·拉登依然不知藏身何处。
Has the time come for NATO to declare victory and leave?	北约是时候宣布胜利并离开了吗？
Recently, a French diplomatic cable relating a conversation on September 2 between the French ambassador to Afghanistan, Francois Fitou, and his British colleague, Sherard Cowper-Coles, was leaked in Le Canard Enchainé , a French satirical magazine.	最近一份有关法国驻阿富汗大使Francois Fitou与英国驻阿富汗大使Sherard Cowper-Coles谈话的法国外交电报的内容在法国的一份讽刺杂志《Le Canard Enchainé》上被泄露。
Cowper-Coles was reported to have said that the security situation in Afghanistan was deteriorating, that NATO’s presence was making it worse, and that the two American presidential hopefuls should be dissuaded from getting bogged down further.	Cowper-Coles据说声称阿富汗的安全形势正在恶化，而北约的存在使情况变得更加糟糕，两名美国总统候选人应该被劝说不要在那里陷得更深。
The only realistic policy would be to cultivate an “acceptable dictator.”	唯一现实的政策应该是扶植一位“可接受的独裁者 ” 。
Of course, the British Foreign Office denied that these thoughts reflected the British government’s views.	当然，英国外交部否认这些想法代表了英国政府的观点。
The departing commander of British forces in Afghanistan, Brigadier Mark Carleton-Smith, has claimed that defeating the Taliban was “neither feasible nor supportable.”	即将离职的英国驻阿富汗部队指挥官Mark Carleton-Smith准将曾经说过击溃塔利班“既不可行也得不到支持 ” 。
Two days after making that gloomy assessment, the French chief of the defense staff, General Jean-Louis Georgelin, followed suit.	而在这个令人沮丧的评论发表两天后，法国国防参谋长Jean-Louis Georgelin将军也作出了类似的表述。
And Kai Eide, the United Nations Secretary-General’s special representative in Afghanistan, has agreed that the situation cannot be stabilized by military means alone.	联合国秘书长阿富汗问题特别代表Kai Eide同意仅仅依靠军事行动无法稳定那里的局势。
All call for a concerted political effort implying some form of negotiation with the Taliban.	所有的人都呼吁各方作出共同的政治努力以便与塔利班开展某种形式的谈判。
A draft report by American intelligence agencies has also concluded that Afghanistan is in a “downward spiral” and casts serious doubt on the Afghan government’s ability to stem the Taliban’s resurgence.	美国情报部门的一份简报也曾得出结论说阿富汗处于“恶性循环”中，并且对阿富汗政府阻止塔利班重新崛起的能力表示严重怀疑。
Moreover, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia hosted a Ramadan breakfast for the Afghan government and Taliban representatives.	此外，沙特国王阿卜杜拉为阿富汗政府和塔利班代表举行了一次斋月早餐会。
Predictably, both parties deny that any serious negotiations took place, while the United States and Britain claimed to know nothing about this “Saudi initiative.”	两方并不令人意外地否认进行了任何正式的谈判，同时美国和英国也表示对于“沙特倡议”一无所知。
But Afghan Defense Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak subsequently said that resolution of the conflict required a “political settlement” with the Taliban.	但是阿富汗国防部长Abdul Rahim Wardak随后表示解决冲突需要与塔利班达成“政治和解 ” 。
Yet at the recent NATO summit in Budapest, US Defense Secretary Robert Gates called on NATO members to provide more troops for missions in Afghanistan.	然而最近在布达佩斯召开的北约峰会上，美国国防部长盖茨呼吁北约成员国向阿富汗增派更多的部队。
He accused the British of being “defeatist” and argued that Afghanistan’s deteriorating security situation could be addressed with an Iraq-style “surge,” which has undoubtedly brought down violence levels in that country.	他指责英国是“失败主义者 ” ， 指出阿富汗恶化的安全形势是可以通过伊拉克式的“大量增兵”来解决的，在伊拉克的增兵行动无疑大大降低了该国的暴力活动水平。
The Americans have already committed 8,000 extra troops for next year.	美国已经承诺明年再增兵8000人。
So there seems to be a split.	看起来各方存在着分歧。
The British and French are busy briefing, and preparing to scale down their commitments in Afghanistan.	英国和法国正忙于吹风、并且准备缩减它们在阿富汗的驻军。
They believe that boosting allied forces will only increase the sense of occupation and give the Taliban more targets.	它们认为加强联军的力量只会增加当地群众被占领的感觉并且为塔利班提供更多袭击的靶子。
The emergence of a “realistic dictator” might allow NATO to withdraw most of its troops within a few years.	一个“现实的独裁者”的出现也许能使北约在未来几年内撤出其大部分的部队。
But the Americans want a “surge,” and the US general commanding NATO forces in the country said last month that he needed three more brigades, some 15,000 troops in all, and Gates has asked the Europeans either to send or pay for them.	但是美国却希望“增兵 ” ， 负责指挥北约在该国的部队的美国将军上个月表示他需要增加三个旅，总共大约15000名士兵，而盖茨已经要求欧洲国家要么派兵要么出钱。
The Americans do recognize the importance of courting those Taliban leaders they believe to be motivated by tribal loyalties rather than religious ideology, but they oppose the latest Afghan policy of negotiating directly and officially with the Taliban.	美国确实认识到与那些他们认为更多地受部族忠诚而非宗教意识形态所驱动的塔利班领导人示好的重要性，他们只是反对阿富汗最近直接与塔利班举行正式谈判的政策。
Both Barack Obama and John McCain advocate increasing troop levels in Afghanistan above the levels that the Bush administration has already pledged.	奥巴马和麦凯恩都支持在布什政府已经承诺的基础上再向阿富汗增派更多的部队。
Obama has that said he would send troops from Iraq as an urgent priority.	奥巴马表示他将从伊拉克抽调部队来应付这一当务之急的问题。
McCain has given no details of his plans.	麦凯恩尚未给出他的计划的细节。
Obama has made it a campaign issue to criticize the Bush administration for neglecting Afghanistan and diverting resources needed there to the misguided war in Iraq.	奥巴马把指责布什政府忽视阿富汗以及把那里急需的资源用到伊拉克被误导的战争上作为他的一个竞选议题。
McCain, though, has always maintained that Iraq is the more important battlefield.	而麦凯恩则一直认为伊拉克是更重要的战场。
What candidates promise on the stump is not always what they do in office.	候选人在巡回演说中的承诺在他们当选后并不一定会兑现。
In the second presidential debate, Obama said, “We will kill bin Laden.	在第二场总统候选人辩论中，奥巴马说“我们将杀死本·拉登。
We will crush al-Qaeda.”	我们将击溃基地组织 。 ”
Are his patriotic credentials strong enough for him to renege on this pledge and pursue negotiations to withdraw without capturing the talismanic Osama?	他的爱国口碑是否足够强到让他违背自己的承诺而寻求撤军谈判，同时不去抓捕似乎有护身符保护的奥萨马？
What would a US withdrawal mean for Afghanistan, for Pakistan, and for the future of NATO?	而美国的撤军对阿富汗、巴基斯坦以及北约��未来又意味着什么？
To retreat from its first major “out of area” mission would be a damaging blow for the alliance.	从它在“区域外”的第一次重大行动中撤军对于这个联盟来说将是一次毁灭性的打击。
Curiously, McCain may have more room for maneuver.	奇怪的是，麦凯恩可能有更大的操作空间。
Republican presidents have a better record in negotiating with enemies than do Democratic ones.	共和党总统在与敌人的谈判上有着比民主党更好的记录。
Eisenhower ended the Korean War, Nixon the war in Vietnam – both wars started by their Democrat predecessors.	埃森豪威尔结束了朝鲜战争，尼克松结束了越南战争 — — 这两场战争都是由他们的民主党前任发起的。
Nixon, a vitriolic anti-Communist, opened relations with Mao’s China and started détente with the Soviet Union.	是尼克松，一位刻薄的反共产主义者，开始了与毛的中国的联系并且开始与苏联缓和关系。
Reagan brought the US hostages back from Iran.	里根从伊朗带回了美国人质。
Having condemned the “evil empire” of communism, he helped bring the Cold War to an end. Only recently, George W Bush evicted North Korea from his “axis of evil” by removing that country from America’s list of countries that sponsor terrorism.	在谴责了共产主义的“邪恶帝国”后，他帮助结束了冷战。 而最近布什将朝鲜从支持恐怖主义的国家名单中撤出，不再称其为“邪恶轴心国 ” 。
And what about the British?	英国人怎么办呢？
Have they suddenly remembered the unsustainable cost of fighting asymmetric conflicts?	他们是否突然想起了对抗不对称冲突的不可持续的代价？
Afghanistan has never been a place any foreign army could stay for long.	从来没有任何外国军队能在阿富汗久留。
The British were burned there twice (1840-1, 1878-80).	英国在那里失败了两次（1840-1841年以及1878-1880年 ） 。
So were the Russians.	苏联也同样遭到了失败。
Rudyard Kipling got his arithmetic right in 1886:	吉卜林1886年所作的计算是绝对正确的：
No proposition Euclid wrote,	欧几里德所写的任何定理，
No formulae the text-books know,	书本上所学到的任何方程，
Will turn the bullet from your coat,	都不会使飞向你的子弹改变方向，
Or ward the tulwar’s downward blow	或者避开向下砍来的弯刀，
Strike hard who cares – shoot straight who can –	那些对此表示反对的人会被痛击 — — 那些逞能的人会被直接命中 — —
The odds are on the cheaper man.	倒霉的总是那些更低级的人。
	
Asia’s Giants Under New Management	新管理下的亚洲巨人
BALI – More than one-third of the world’s population lives in just three countries: China, India, and Indonesia.	巴厘岛—世界上三分之一多的人口生活在三个国家中：中国、印度和印尼。
With all three undergoing significant political transitions – whether electing a new leader or experiencing a recently installed leader’s first key decisions – this is a decisive moment in shaping the global economy’s future.	这三个国家都在经历重大政治转型 — — 或者是新领导人选举，或者是领导人的关键决定 — — 全球经济的未来也迎来了决定形时刻。
If Narendra Modi and Joko “Jokowi” Widodo win the upcoming elections in India and Indonesia, respectively, they will join Chinese President Xi Jinping in spurring regional economic growth – likely causing Asia’s rise to global economic preeminence to occur faster than the world ever imagined.	如果纳兰德拉·莫迪（Narendra Modi）和“佐科维”佐科·维多多（Joko “Jokowi” Widodo）在即将到来的印度和印尼大选中获胜，他们就会加入中国国家主席习近平的行列刺激地区经济增长，这可能让亚洲以比世界所能想象的速度更快地成为全球经济主宰。
In the year since Xi assumed the Chinese presidency, he has centralized power to a remarkable degree.	习近平成为中国国家主席一年以来，他令人瞩目地集中了权力。
Not only has he positioned himself as General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman of the Central Military Commission; he has also neutralized potential rivals, including former Chongqing party boss Bo Xilai and former security chief Zhou Yongkang.	他不但集中共总书记和中央军委主席于一身；还打击了潜在对手，包括前重庆市委书记薄熙来和国家安全主管周永康。
Consolidating power in a country as large and messy as China is extremely difficult, making Xi’s accomplishment remarkable, to say the least.	在庞大而复杂的中国巩固权力是十分困难的，因此，习近平的成就令人瞩目。
After all, it took Xi’s predecessor, Hu Jintao, far longer to achieve a similar degree of authority.	毕竟，习近平的前任胡锦涛花了很长的时间才获得类似的权威。
But it is only a first step.	但这只是第一步。
Xi is now attempting to use this power to push through the difficult reforms that Hu and his prime minister, Wen Jiabao, have been widely criticized for neglecting.	现在，习近平正在试图用这一权力来推动艰难的改革。 而胡锦涛和前总理温家宝因为忽略这些改革而饱受批评。
Despite the pressure to make up for lost time, Xi knows that he must be pragmatic in his reform efforts.	尽管需要奋起直追夺回时间，但习近平也明白改革措施需要务实精神。
First, he must build a national consensus capable of overcoming the powerful vested interests that oppose changes – including the dissolution of monopolies, improved market regulation, increased transparency, and tax reform – that would level the economic playing field.	首先，他必须建立能够克服反对改变的强大既得利益的全国一致，破除垄断、改善市场监管、增加透明度、实施税收改革，从而让经济变竞争得更加公平。
While Western leaders generally support Xi’s market-oriented reform strategy, they remain puzzled by his devotion to the CCP.	西方领导人总体都支持习近平的市场导向改革计划，但仍对习近平对党的热爱迷惑不解。
To the Western mind, any truly effective reformer must be a closet democrat, like the Soviet Union’s last president, Mikhail Gorbachev.	从西方思维看，所有真正高效的改革家必然是亲民主派，如苏联末代总统戈尔巴乔夫。
But Xi has no intention of being the People’s Republic’s last president, and the Soviet Union’s collapse in the wake of Gorbachev’s political reforms taught him the importance of balancing change with stability.	但习近平无意成为中华人民共和国的末代主席，戈尔巴乔夫的政治改革带来了苏联解体，这教育了习近平在变化和稳定之间保持平衡的重要性。
For Xi, the CCP’s appeal lies not so much in its ideology as in its capacity to help bolster China’s prosperity.	对习近平来说，中共的号召力主要不是来自它的意识形态，而是来自它推动中国繁荣的能力。
Indeed, China’s current leaders are modernizing nationalists, not communists.	事实上，中国现任领导集体都是现代化民族主义者而非共产主义者。
They recognize that China’s success over the last three decades is a direct result of its shift toward a more open economy and a freer society – a shift that will continue under Xi.	他们认为，中国在过去三十年的成功是经济更开放、社会更自由的直接结果，习近平将继续这一变化。
Another modernizing nationalist, Narendra Modi, is likely to become India’s prime minister following the elections that started this month.	另一位现代化民族主义者纳兰德拉·莫迪有望在本月开始的大选后成为印度总理。
Modi’s pro-business approach is a major theme of his election campaign, and ordinary Indians are hopeful that his policy program will enhance their wellbeing.	莫迪的亲商业方针是其主要竞选主题之一，普通印度人也希望他的政策计划能够增加他们的福利。
As Chief Minister of Gujarat, Modi worked to encourage foreign investment, provide around-the-clock electricity, build roads, and engage in intelligent urban planning.	在担任古吉拉特邦首席部长期间，莫迪致力于鼓励外国投资、提供24小时供电、建设公路并着手进行智能城市规划。
Annual economic growth in the state averaged more than 10% from 2006 to 2012, when the Gujarati city of Ahmedabad was short-listed for the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize.	2006—2012年，古吉拉特邦年平均经济增长率高达10%以上，该邦城市艾哈迈达巴德（Ahmedabad）也进入了李光耀世界城市奖决选名单。
But history haunts Modi’s campaign – namely, the deaths of more than 1,000 people in anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat in 2002.	但历史不利于莫迪的选战 — — 2002年，古吉拉特邦爆发了反穆斯林动乱，超过1,000人丧生。
Though the Supreme Court cleared him of all personal wrongdoing, the tragedy’s legacy persists, making it difficult for Modi to win Muslim votes without alienating his Hindu nationalist base.	尽管最高法院判决他并无个人过错，但这场悲剧的后果一直存在，莫迪如果不撇清他与印度教民族主义者的干系，就难以赢得穆斯林的选票。
This has not prevented Modi from taking political risks, beginning with his assertion that India needs toilets more than temples.	这并未防止莫迪的政治冒险，他首先提出，印度需要更多地厕所，而不是庙宇。
But his decision to run for Prime Minister is by far his riskiest move, as it will test his national appeal.	但他决定参选总理才是最大的冒险，这将考验他的全国吸引力。
Of course, even if he wins, Modi will never be able to consolidate power to the degree that Xi has, owing to India’s separation of powers and democratic constitution.	当然，即使胜出，拜权力分裂程度和民主宪法所赐，莫迪也无法获得像习近平那样的权力。
At best, he will lead a coalition government, in which his capacity to make compromises and connect with unlikely allies will dictate his success.	他最多只能领导一个联合政府，他促成妥协和与不可能与其结盟的对手的打交道的能力将决定他能否成功。
Jokowi, the governor of Jakarta, will face a similar challenge if he wins Indonesia’s presidential election in July, given that his party, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, will not have a majority in parliament.	雅加达省省长佐科维也将面临类似的挑战，如果他赢得7月印尼总统大选的话。 因为他所在的印尼民主斗争党（Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle）不可能赢得议会多数。
Fortunately, he is a skilled politician – popular, but not populist, with tremendous persuasive powers.	幸运的是，他是政治老手，他受欢迎，但并不民粹主义，并且说服力很强。
These qualities enable Jokowi to deliver results, exemplified in his success in convincing Jakarta’s slum dwellers to leave their shanties to allow for urban development.	这些资质让佐科维能够带来成果，能够说服雅加达贫民窟居民离开棚户以供城市开发就是明证。
Under his leadership, highway projects that had been blocked for 16 years have been relaunched in the city.	在他的领导下，被阻止了16年的雅加达高速公路建设获得了重启。
Like Xi and Modi, Jokowi is focused mainly on economic development.	和习近平和莫迪一样，佐科维的主要关注点在经济发展。
In this regard, his background as a furniture manufacturer and exporter is a major asset, enabling him to bring a level of hands-on knowledge and experience that past Indonesian presidents have lacked.	从这方面看，他的家具制造商和出口商背景十分有利，这能给他带来此前几任印尼总统所欠缺的实践知识和经验。
Given Jokowi’s business acumen, he understands that Indonesia must improve its logistical capabilities if its economy is to engage the world.	佐科维拥有敏锐的商业思维，因此他明白，如果印尼经济想融入世界，就必须改善其物流力。
Perhaps most important, Xi, Modi, and Jokowi are all pragmatists.	也许最重要的是，习近平、莫迪和佐科维都是务实派。
They know that, in order to achieve rapid economic growth and modernization – a key priority for all of them – they will need to compromise with opposition forces at home and adopt best practices from abroad.	他们知道，为了实现快速经济增长和现代化 — — 他们都面临这一紧迫挑战 — — 就需要与国内反对势力妥协并洗后国外的最佳经验。
Their shared desire to engage the modern world suggests that their leadership will improve the lives of their countries’ citizens.	他们都想融入现代世界，这意味着他们的领导将改善国民生活。
And better lives for one-third of the world’s population will benefit the rest of us as well.	而三分之一世界人口生活的改善将让我们其他人也都受益。
	
Asia’s Reform Trinity?	亚洲的改革三位一体？
SINGAPORE – Asia is poised to enter a historical sweet spot, with three of its most populous countries – China, India, and Indonesia – led by strong, dynamic, and reform-minded leaders.	新加坡—亚洲正站在历史的黄金机会点，三个人口最多的国家 — — 中国、印度和印度尼西亚都由强大且有活力的改革派领导人领导。
In fact, China’s Xi Jinping, India’s Narendra Modi, and Indonesia’s Joko “Jokowi” Widodo could end up ranked among their countries’ greatest modern leaders.	事实上，中国的习近平、印度的莫迪和印尼的“佐科维”佐科·维多多（以下称佐科维）都有望跻身各自国家最伟大现代领导人行列。
In China, Mao Zedong united the country in 1949, while Deng Xiaoping was responsible for engineering its unprecedented economic rise.	毛泽东在1949年统一了中国，而邓小平发动了前所未有的经济崛起。
For Xi to join their ranks, he must create a modern, rules-based state.	习近平要想和毛邓看齐，就必须建立以基于规则（rules-based）的现代中国。
That requires, first and foremost, slaying the massive dragon of corruption.	而这首先需要清除腐败的“大老虎 ” 。
Over the years, corruption has become endemic in China, with regional party leaders and bosses in state-owned enterprises wielding their vast privileges and authority to accumulate personal wealth.	多年来，腐败已成为中国的顽疾，地方党政领导人和国有企业负责人利用巨大的特权和权威敛聚个人财富。
This has severely undermined the Chinese Communist Party’s legitimacy, while hampering the kind of market-based competition that China’s economy needs to propel the country to high-income status.	这严重破坏了中国共产党的合法性，也妨碍了驱动中国经济迈入高收入行列所必须的基于市场的竞争。
So far, Xi seems to be up to the challenge.	目前，习近平似乎占据了对这一挑战的上风。
He has been boldly pursuing major figures who were previously considered “untouchable,” such as General Xu Caihou, a former vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, and Zhou Yongkang, a former member of the Politburo Standing Committee, China’s highest government body.	他大胆地将目标对准了此前被认为“不可触及”的大人物，如前中央军委副主席徐才厚和前中共中央政治局常委周永康。
But the long-term fight against corruption cannot depend on Xi alone.	但与腐败的长期斗争不能光依靠习近平。
It will succeed only if strong institutions are created to protect and nurture the rule of law long after Xi is out of power.	只有建立强大的制度以保护和培育习近平退休之后的法治精神，才能赢得这场斗争。
If Xi chooses to establish such institutions, he has a strong legal tradition upon which to call.	如果习近平选择建立这样的制度，他有强大的法律传统可以援引。
As former US Ambassador to China Gary F. Locke reported in a speech early this year, the concept of equality before the law has deep historical roots.	正如前美国驻华大使骆家辉在今年出的演讲中所言，法律面前人人平等的观念具有深刻的历史渊源。
Indeed, in the fourth century BC, the statesman and reformer Shang Yang famously asserted that, “When the prince violates the law, the crime he commits is the same as that of the common people.”	事实上，在公元前四世纪，政治家、改革家商鞅就说 ， “ 王子犯法与庶民同罪 。 ”
Building on this tradition, Xi can create strong institutions that will stand the test of time.	根据这一传统，习近平可以建立强大的经得起时间考验的制度。
If he does – recognizing that, to be credible, the rule of law must apply even to the Party’s most influential figures – he will become modern China’s third-strongest leader.	如果他这么做了 — — 认识到要想赢得信誉就必须以法治精神约束党的最高人物 — — 他就能成为现代中国第三强势的领导人。
In India, Mahatma Gandhi rejuvenated the country’s soul, which had been battered by colonialism, and Jawaharlal Nehru established its democratic political culture.	在印度，圣雄甘地重新唤醒了遭遇殖民主义重创的国家精神，尼赫鲁则确立了印度的民主政治文化。
Modi now must lay the foundations for India’s emergence as a global economic power.	如今，莫迪必须为印度崛起成为全球经济强国奠定基础。
Replicating the 10% annual growth rates achieved in Gujarat under Modi’s leadership from 2004 to 2012 would obviously be a boon to India’s development prospects and global standing.	复制2004—2012年主政古吉拉特邦每年经济增长10%的成绩显然将提振印度的发展前景和全球地位。
But achieving such high growth rates in a sustainable way will demand far-reaching, sometimes painful reforms, such as the removal of wasteful subsidies, especially for fuel, in order to free up resources for, say, increased health-care expenditure.	但以可持续的方式实现如此高的增长率需要深远的、有时甚至是痛苦的改革，如取消纯属浪费的补贴，特别是能源补贴，以解放资源用于（比如）增加医疗支出。
Other imperatives include shrinking the budget deficit, removing internal barriers to trade, and encouraging private investment.	其他当务之急包括缩减预算赤字、取消内部贸易壁垒、鼓励私人投资等。
To win the support needed to implement these reforms without undermining political stability or social cohesion, Modi must demonstrate that he is an inclusive leader capable of cooperating with Indians outside of his Hindu nationalist base – including the country’s 150 million-plus Muslims.	要赢得实施这些改革而不破坏政治稳定或社会团结所需要的支持，莫迪必须证明他是一个包容的领导人，有能力与不属于其印度教民族主义者圈子的印度人合作 — — 包括1,500多万印度穆斯林。
If he succeeds, he, like Xi, will become his country’s next iconic leader.	如果获得成功，他将和习近平一样，成为祖国的下一个标志性领导人。
In Indonesia’s case, the two most influential leaders so far have been Sukarno, who used powerful rhetoric to foster a sense of national unity in one of the world’s most diverse countries, and Suharto, who overthrew Sukarno and created a strong economic base that lifted millions out of poverty.	在印度尼西亚，到目前为止影响力最大的两位领导人是苏加诺和苏哈托。 苏加诺用他的雄辩为这个世界上最多样化的国家之一构建了民族团结。
Jokowi must now lay the institutional foundations for good governance.	而推翻苏���诺的苏哈托建立了一个强大的经济基础，将数百万人带出贫困。
Jokowi has risen from humble beginnings to the apex of power without compromising his image as a “man of the people” or his reputation for pragmatism and honesty.	佐科维以卑微的出身稳定权力巅峰，并且从未在其“人民之子”的形象和务实诚信的声誉方面妥协。
Jokowi has a long track record of good governance, having implemented effective policies during his stint as Mayor of Surakarta (such as refurbishing markets, relocating slum dwellers, and cutting bureaucratic red tape), and as Governor of Jakarta (where he broadened access to health care and education).	佐科维拥有长期且优秀的治理成绩，担任苏拉卡尔塔（Surakarta）市长期间，他实施了一系列有效政策（如翻新市场、搬迁贫民窟和削减官僚繁文缛节 ） ， 担任雅加达省省长期间亦然（增加了医疗和教育的普及程度 ） 。
But replicating this success at the national level will be no easy feat.	但在全国范围复制这一成功决非易事。
Jokowi, who takes office in October, must implement policies that address rising inequality, unsustainable fuel subsidies, entrenched corruption, inadequate infrastructure, and restrictive labor laws – all while rebuilding trust in Indonesian institutions.	10月上台的佐科维必须采取措施治理不平等性加剧、不可持续的燃料补贴、根深蒂固的腐败、基础设施不足和过于严格的劳动法 — — 与此同时还要重新建立对印尼制度的信任。
The challenges facing Jokowi are compounded by the fact that his ruling coalition holds only about one-third of the seats in Indonesia’s parliament, with the rest loyal to the coalition of his rival in the presidential election, Prabowo Subianto.	让佐科维所面临的挑战更加复杂的事实是，他的执政联盟只拥有印尼议会的约三分之一议席，其余议员忠于他在总统选举中的对手普拉博沃·苏毕安托（Prabowo Subianto）的联盟。
So, in introducing a new style of governance, exemplified by merit-based cabinet appointments, Jokowi must be careful not to alienate the political and business elites who have long benefited from their tight grip on power.	因此，在引入新的治国风格时 — — 比如根据能力任命内阁成员 — — 佐科维必须小心从事，避免得罪长期从把持权力中获益的政治和商界精英。
In short, if Jokowi is to form a national consensus on the institutions that Indonesia needs, he will have to reach across this political divide.	简言之，如果佐科维要想构建一个印尼所需要的国家制度共识，就必须超越政治分歧。
To this end, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto’s cross-party “Pact for Mexico” could serve as a useful model.	在这方面，墨西哥总统涅托的超越党派的“墨西哥契约 ” （ Pact for Mexico）可以作为有用的榜样。
Promisingly, Jokowi has a reputation for independence from partisan and religious politics, and a talent for communicating with the people.	幸运的是，佐科维拥有独立于党派和宗教政治的声誉，并且长于沟通。
And, as a political outsider, he is in a unique position to direct Indonesia toward a more prosperous, united future – and vault himself into the country’s pantheon of great leaders.	而作为政治外部人士，他拥有独一无二的地位引导印尼走向更繁荣、更团结的未来 — — 也使他本人进入印尼伟大领导人俱乐部。
China, India, and Indonesia are all well positioned to take important steps forward.	中国、印度和印尼都处于跨出重要前进步伐的有利位置。
A commitment by Xi, Modi, and Jokowi to do what is needed would bring rapid, far-reaching progress to their respective countries, Asia, and the global order.	习近平、莫迪和佐科维致力于应做之事将为各自国家、亚洲和全球秩序带来迅速的、影响深远的进步。
	
The Techno-Political Transformation	技术政治转型
GENEVA – It would be an understatement to say that our world is undergoing rapid and far-reaching change.	日内瓦—说我们的世界正在经历快速而深远的变革有些保守了。
The global economy, the geopolitical landscape, the environment, and technology are subject to constantly shifting conditions that reinforce and transform one another in a web of complex interactions.	全球经济、地缘政治局势、环境以及科技面临不断变化的条件的约束，这些条件组成了一个复杂的互动网络，互相强化和转化。
In such an unpredictable and interconnected setting, effective leadership must be based on a radical outlook, a multifaceted skillset, and an understanding of technology and talent.	在这样一个不可预测又相互联系的环境中，有效领导必须建立在不同凡响的远见、多方位的技能和对科技和人才的理解之上。
The trends that are shaping the twenty-first-century world embody both promise and peril.	决定二十一世纪世界的趋势既包含了希望，也包含了危险。
Globalization, for example, has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, while contributing to social fragmentation and a massive increase in inequality, not to mention serious environmental damage.	比如，全球化将数亿人带出了贫困，但也造成了社会分裂和不平等性剧增，更不用说严重的环境问题了。
Likewise, big data offers untold benefits to companies and consumers, but poses a real threat to privacy and personal freedom.	类似地，大数据给公司和消费者带来了难以估量的好处，但也给隐私和个人自由造成了实实在在的威胁。
A similar dichotomy applies to many other critical issues, including adaptation to climate change, efforts to improve resource management, urbanization and the rise of megacities, increased labor mobility, and human-capital expansion.	类似的二分法也适用于其他许多关键问题，包括适应气候变化、改善资源管理的措施、城市化和大都市的兴起、劳动力流动性的增加和人力资本扩张等。
The scale and complexity of the challenges that lie ahead are undoubtedly daunting.	未来挑战的规模和复杂性毫无疑问是令人畏惧的。
But rapid, far-reaching change can also present great opportunities.	但快速、深远的变革也带来了很大的机会。
To make the most of them, the world needs technologically literate leaders – call them “techno-politicians” – who have an intuitive understanding of how to shape progress in this new, unpredictable environment.	为了抓住其中大部分机会，世界需要精通科技的领导人 — — 不妨称之为“技术政治家 ” （ techno-politician ） ， 他们应该拥有对如何在这一不可预测的新环境中取得进步这一问题的直觉理解。
Within the framework of techno-politics, economic growth and technological innovation are the two most important factors shaping the global landscape.	在技术政治框架内，经济增长和科技创新是决定全球图景的最重要的两个因素。
How we adapt to and guide their trajectories will determine our collective future.	我们如何适应它们、如何引导它们的轨迹将决定着我们的集体未来。
In economic terms, the world is entering an era of diminished expectations.	用经济学术语讲，世界正在进入一个预期递减的时代。
If, as predicted, average annual GDP growth amounts to 3% in the foreseeable future, it will take 25 years for the world economy to double in size – ten years longer than it took before the global economic crisis, when average GDP growth stood at 5%.	如果如同预测的那样，在可预见的未来，平均年GDP增长率达到3 % ， 那么世界经济规模每隔25年可以扩大一倍 — — 比全球金融及危机前（平均年GDP增长率为5 % ） 长了十年。
Learning to live with slower growth will not be easy.	学习如何在增长减速的环境下生活并非易事。
Given that debt-fueled consumption has run its course, productivity gains will become an increasingly critical driver of economic growth.	债务驱动型消费已是明日黄花，生产率提高将成为日益关键的经济增长驱动力。
But, at a time when rising inequality is undermining social cohesion, it is far from certain that the conditions required to support such gains – that is, improved education and stronger incentives to innovate – can be met.	但是，在不平等的加剧破坏着社会凝聚力的时期，支持生产率提高所要求的条件 — — 即教育和创新激励的改善 — — 是否能够满足远未可知。
Perhaps most important, even as economic growth slows, technological change continues at a breakneck pace, raising seemingly unanswerable questions about its potential impact on the global economy.	也许最重要的是，即使经济增长减速，科技变革仍能以极快的速度发展，这就引起了一个似乎无法解决的问题，即其对全球经济的潜在影响力几何。
While some warn that technological progress will leave many unemployed, others remain convinced that displaced workers will find new jobs that do not yet exist, as has occurred in the past.	尽管一些人警告科技进步将让许多人失业，但其他人仍相信被替代的工人能够在从前不存在的岗位上找到新工作，一如过去所发生的那样。
All that is certain is that technology and innovation are disrupting virtually every aspect of life.	唯一可以确定的是，科技和创新将破坏生活的几乎每一个方面。
How can we adapt to such a world?	我们如何能够适应这样一个世界？
What underpins success in this new and challenging environment?	在这个新的挑战性环境中，什么才是成功的基础？
In a techno-polity, two inextricably linked factors are crucial: talent and innovation.	在技术政治中，两大牢不可破的联系因素至关重要：人才和创新。
Talent is now the key factor driving competitiveness (or the lack thereof) for companies and countries alike.	人才是推进（或缺少）公司和国家竞争力的关键因素。
Indeed, “talentism” will be the prevailing economic credo, with human or intellectual capital becoming the most critical asset – and the one most difficult to acquire and retain.	事实上 ， “ 人才论”将成为普遍的经济教条，人力和知识资本将成为最关键的资产 — — 也是最难获得和保存的资产。
Innovation, spurred by talent, will determine success.	受人才刺激的创新将决定成功。
In the future, the distinction between high- and low-income countries, or between emerging and mature markets, will no longer matter.	在未来，高收入和低收入国家的区别，或新兴市场和成熟市场的区别将不复重要。
The question will be whether or not an economy can innovate.	问题将在于经济能否创新。
A techno-polity also recognizes the critical role of cooperation, strategic thinking, and adaptation.	技术政治也认识到合作、策略思维和适应的关键作用。
The biggest challenges nowadays are global in nature, and thus can be addressed only by engaging decision-makers and interest groups from various spheres.	今天的最大挑战都是全球性的，也只有通过各领域有魅力的决策者和利益集团才能应对。
New partnerships must be forged, even among actors with seemingly disparate interests.	必须塑造新型合作关系，即便不同行动方之间利益看似大相径庭。
Those who struggle to cope with change must be supported, not scorned.	在变革面前手忙脚乱的行动方应该获得支持而不是嘲笑。
But effective techno-politicians must go beyond firefighting to think about the long term.	但高效的技术政治家必须超越救火思维，而将目光放长远。
They must be able to respond to new and impending developments without delay, constantly experimenting with new ideas and processes.	他们必须能够毫不迟疑地应对发展局势，连续不断地实验新思想和过程。
Moreover, they must to be able to understand and react simultaneously to multiple competing realities.	此外，他们还必须能够同时理解和对多重竞争现实产生反应。
The role of the techno-polity is to steer the world toward positive outcomes.	技术政治的作用是引导世界走向积极方向。
It will demand that decision-makers use their heads and hearts – and it will also test their nerves.	它要求决策者用脑也用心，还会考验他们的神经。
	
The Global Economy in 2014	2014全球经济
GENEVA – At the dawn of a new year, the world is in the midst of several epic transitions.	日内瓦—新年来临之际，世界仍处在世界仍在极大几大划时代的变化当中。
Economic growth patterns, the geopolitical landscape, the social contract that binds people together, and our planet’s ecosystem are all undergoing radical, simultaneous transformations, generating anxiety and, in many places, turmoil.	经济增长模式、地缘政治局势、实现人类团结的社会契约、以及地球生态系统都在经历彻底而同时的变革，让人感到焦虑，也让很多地方陷入了动荡。
From an economic standpoint, we are entering an era of diminished expectations and increased uncertainty.	从经济角度看，我们正在进入预期下降、不确定性增加的时代。
In terms of growth, the world will have to live with less.	增长方面，我们将面临不如从前的局面。
To understand the implications of this, consider the following: If the global economy grew at its pre-crisis pace (more than 5% per year) for the foreseeable future, its size would double in less than 15 years; at 3%, doubling world GDP would take about 25 years.	要理解这所带来的影响，试想若全球经济在可预见的未来继续以危机前的速度（每年超过5 % ） 增长，则世界规模将在15年内翻番；若按3%的速度增长，世界GDP翻番需要大约25年。
This makes a significant difference to the speed at which wealth creation occurs, with profound effects on expectations.	这意味着财富创造的速度将发生极大的变化，从而对预期造成深远影响。
We ignore the power of compound growth to our detriment.	我们忽视了复合增长的力量对我们造成的伤害。
As for uncertainty, the world’s four largest economies are currently undergoing major transitions.	在不确定性方面，世界最大的四个经济体目前都在经历重要转型。
The US is striving to boost growth in a fractured political environment.	美国在竭尽全力在破碎的政治环境中提振增长。
China is moving from a growth model based on investment and exports to one led by internal demand.	中国在促使增长模式从基于投资和出口转变为基于内需。
Europe is struggling to preserve the integrity of its common currency while resolving a multitude of complex institutional issues.	欧洲正在勉力维持共同货币并解决众多复杂的制度性问题。
And Japan is trying to combat two decades of deflation with aggressive and unconventional monetary policies.	日本正在通过非常规的激进货币政策与二十年的通缩作斗争。
For each, the formulation and outcome of complex and sensitive policy decisions implies many “unknowns,” with global interdependence heightening the risk of large unintended consequences.	对于每一个经济体，复杂而敏感的政策决策的形式和结果都存在诸多“未知 ” ， 而全球相互依赖的特征让意料之外的重大后果的风险更大了。
For example, the US Federal Reserve’s policy of quantitative easing (QE) has had a major effect on other countries’ currencies, and on capital flows to and from emerging markets.	比如，美联储的量化宽松（QE）政策对其他国家的货币和进出新兴市场的资本流具有重大影响。
When QE was launched, it was the least flawed of the available policies, and it averted a catastrophic global depression.	QE出台时，它是所有可行政策中缺陷最小的，并且扭转了灾难性的全球萧条。
But its downsides are now apparent, and its abatement in 2014 could fuel further uncertainty.	但如今QE的副作用逐渐显现，而它在2014年的逐渐退出将带来新的不确定性。
The Fed’s QE policy, and variants of it elsewhere, have caused the major central banks’ balance sheets to expand dramatically (from $5-6 trillion prior to the crisis to almost $20 trillion now), causing financial markets to become addicted to easy money.	美联储的QE政策以及其他国家的众多变化版QE让主要央行的资产负债表迅速扩张（从危机前的5—6万亿美元扩大到今天的近20万亿美元 ） ， 导致金融市场患上了廉价资金瘾。
This has led, in turn, to a global search for yield, artificial asset-price inflation, and misallocation of capital.	而这反过来又导致全球追逐收益率，造成人为的资产泡沫和资本错配。
As a result, the longer QE lasts, the greater the collateral damage to the real economy.	因此，QE维持时间越长，对实体经济的附带伤害就越大。
The concern now is that when the Fed begins to taper QE and dollar liquidity drains from global markets, structural problems and imbalances will resurface.	现在的担心是当美联储开始逐渐减少QE、美元流动性从全球市场中抽走时2，结构性问题和失衡将卷土重来。
After all, competitiveness-enhancing reforms in many advanced economies remain far from complete, while the ratio of these countries’ total public and private debt to GDP is now 30% higher than before the crisis.	毕竟，许多发达经济体的增强竞争力的改革措施远远没有到位，而这些国家的公私债务总额/GDP比率比危机前高了30 % 。
This source of uncertainty coincides with weakening performance in many emerging countries.	除此之外的另一个不确定性源头是许多新兴国家表现萎靡。
Back in 2007, emerging-market growth was expected to outpace that of advanced economies by a wide margin, before converging.	2007年，人们预期新兴市场增长会在趋同前超出发达经济体很多。
Today, the advanced economies contribute more to global GDP growth than emerging countries, where growth is forecast to average 4% in the coming years.	如今，发达经济体对全球GDP增长的贡献已经超过新兴国家，新兴国家未来几年的增长率预计平均为4 % 。
Economic conditions are slowly improving in high-income countries, but a range of downward pressures may persist for years.	高收入国家的经济环境在缓慢改善，但一些衰退压力将持续多年。
The US economy, for example, remains stuck in a subpar recovery: inflation is too low and unemployment is too high.	比如，美国经济仍处于增长不足的状态：通货膨胀太低，失业率太高。
Official data have often been better than expected, reflecting how resilient, adaptive, and innovative the US economy is, but pre-crisis consumer-spending and growth patterns are unlikely to recur.	官方数据往往比预期更好，这反映出美国经济的恢复力、适应力和创新力，但要恢复危机前消费支出水平和增长模式十分困难。
Improvements in the eurozone are real but tenuous.	欧元区的改善也是实实在在的，但速度很慢。
The good news is that the disaster predicted by many pundits has been avoided, and the recession is coming to an end.	好消息是许多专家所预测要发生的灾难并没有发生，衰退即将进入尾声。
But improvement does not mean resurgence: achieving the robust growth needed to reduce high unemployment, lower the debt/GDP ratio, and improve the fiscal outlook remains elusive.	但改善并不意味着复苏：要实现稳健增长，就必须降低高企的失业率、降低债务/GDP比率、改善财政前景。
The greatest risk for the eurozone in the foreseeable future is not a disorderly exit by some countries, but rather a prolonged period of stagnant growth and high unemployment.	在可预见的未来，欧元区的最大风险不是某些国家的无序退出，而是长期的经济停滞和高失业状态。
Meanwhile, the emerging-market slowdown may well persist, particularly in the largest economies.	与此同时，新兴市场式微之势很有可能会持续下去，特别是其中规模最大的经济体。
Over the past 15 years, the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) have achieved remarkable progress, but their reforms – including new banking regulations and currency regimes – have been among the least difficult to implement.	在过去15年中，金砖四国（巴西、俄罗斯、印度和中国）取得了令人瞩目的成就，但它们改革 — — 包括新银行监管和货币机制 — — 无不在最容易的领域。
So-called second-generation reforms, which are more structural in nature, are vital to long-term growth but much more difficult to realize.	所谓的第二代改革，即更具结构性的改革，对长期增长至关重要，但实现难度要大得多。
Elimination of subsidies, labor market and judicial reforms, and effective anti-corruption measures are politically charged and often are blocked by powerful vested interests.	取消补贴、劳动力市场和司法改革以及有效的反腐措施都具有政治性质，通常会受到强大的既得利益的阻挠。
The global growth slowdown is taking place against a backdrop of rising economic inequality, owing to labor’s declining share of national income – a worldwide phenomenon, resulting from globalization and technological progress, that poses a serious challenge to policymakers.	全球增长放缓的一个背景是经济不平等性的扩大，其原因在于劳动力占国民收入比重的下降 — — 这是一个全球化和技术进步带来的全球性现象，给决策者带来了严峻挑战。
Systems that propagate inequality, or that seem unable to stem its rise, contain the seeds of their own destruction.	滋生不平等或无法阻止不平等滋生的制度孕育了自身毁灭的种子。
But in an interdependent world, there is no obvious solution, because the high mobility of capital fuels global tax competition.	但在一个相互依赖的世界，不存在显而易见的解决方案，因为资本的高度流动助长了全球税收竞争。
Even in stronger-performing countries, such as the US or the United Kingdom, faster GDP growth has yet to boost real incomes.	即使在表现较为强劲的经济体，如美国和英国，GDP增长的加速也没有提振实际收入。
In the US, for example, median household income has fallen by more than 5% since the recovery began.	以美国为例，其中位家庭收入比复苏开始低了5%多。
More generally, lower growth is fueling popular protest and social unrest, particularly in countries that were growing rapidly (for example, Brazil, Turkey, and South Africa), owing to the impact of rising living standards on expectations.	更一般地，增长的减缓催生了群众游行和社会动荡，特别是在增长曾经很快的国家（如巴西、土耳其和南非 ） ， 因为这给不断提高的生活水平预期造成了影响。
In such a charged social and political context, reviving high-quality economic growth is crucial.	在如此紧张的社会和政治环境下，重振高质量经济增长至关重要。
But where will it come from?	但这样的增长来自何处？
Technological progress is a distinct, but highly uncertain, possibility.	技术进步是一个源泉，但具有很高的不确定性。
Many disruptive technologies (for example, advanced robotics, next-generation genomics, energy storage, renewable energy, and 3D printing) could drive future growth, but their full potential can be realized only in the distant future.	许多颠覆性技术（如高级机器人、新一代基因组学、能量储存、可再生能源和3D打印）能驱动未来增长，但其潜力要等到遥远的将来才能充分实现。
With most governments facing fiscal constraints, officials are reluctant to consider projects that might increase public debt.	大部分政府都面临着预算约束，因此官员不愿意考虑可能引起公债上升的项目。
But there is some low-hanging fruit – productive investments that would boost long-term growth and therefore pay for themselves.	但也有唾手可得的果实 — — 能提振长期增长从而自动产生回报的生产性投资。
A focus on four areas, in particular – infrastructure, education, green energy, and sustainable agriculture – could yield high economic and social returns.	特别是，专注于四大领域 — — 基础设施、教育、绿色能源和可持续农业 — — 能产生极高的经济和社会回报。
Ultimately, however, the path to sustained growth requires not just new policies, but also a new mindset.	但是，说到底，可持续增长之路需要的不仅仅是新政策，还需要新思维。
Our societies must become more entrepreneurial, more focused on establishing gender parity, and more rooted in social inclusion.	我们的社会必须变得更有企业家精神，更专注于促进性别平等，更深地植根于社会包容。
There simply is no other way to return the global economy to a path of strong and sustained growth.	没有其他道路可以让全球经济回到强劲而持续的增长上来。
	
Unlocking Girls’ Potential	释放女孩的潜力
NEW YORK – I recently visited a “girls club” – a safe space where adolescent girls come together with trained mentors to build their social networks and learn life skills – in the Tonk District of Rajasthan, India.	纽约—我最近访问了一家印度拉贾斯坦邦坦克区（Tonk District）的“女孩俱乐部 ” — —这是一个安全空间，将青春期女孩集合起来，由训练有素的导师帮助他们构建社交网络、学习生活技能。
As I arrived, I was greeted by a group of teenage girls bouncing along the road, so full of energy and laughter that I couldn’t help but smile, too.	我到达时受到了一群豆蔻年华的少女的夹道欢迎，她们充满了活力和笑声，让我也亲不自禁地微笑起来。
Just imagine, I thought, the potential of 600 million such girls.	我想，六亿这样的女孩，潜力真不可限量。
History’s largest generation of girls aged 10-19 is here, ready to make its mark on the world.	这是有史以来规模最大的一代10—19岁女孩，她们已经准备好在世界留下烙印。
Governments, development organizations, and private institutions are eager to help them translate that youthful potential into an engine of creativity, economic growth, and social progress.	政府、发展组织和私人机构跃跃欲试，要帮助她们将年轻的潜力转化为创造力、经济增长和社会进步的动力。
But, on the path to such a future, girls continue to face major obstacles.	但是，在这条通往未来的道路上，女孩们仍然面对着重大的障碍。
Some 170 million girls – almost one third of girls worldwide – are not enrolled in school.	大约一亿七千万女孩 — — 占全世界女孩总数的近三分之一 — — 无学可上。
This is a major missed opportunity: for every year of forgone schooling, a girl’s potential income drops 10-20%.	这是一个巨大的错失的机会：每辍学一年，女孩的潜在收入就会下降10—20 % 。
Yet there are major barriers to boosting school enrollment – beginning with the persistence of child marriage.	但增加女孩入学率存在重大障碍 — — 首先是难以根除的童婚现象。
Every year, 15 million girls are married before they reach the age of 18 – one every two seconds – with early or forced child marriage affecting about a quarter of girls worldwide.	去年，有1,500万女孩年龄达到18岁之前就结婚了 — — 相当于每两秒钟就有一位 — — 而早婚或被迫的童婚影响到全球女孩总数的四分之一左右。
Beyond increasing the probability that a girl will suffer violence, early marriage boosts girls’ chances of early pregnancy by 90%.	早婚除了会增加女孩遭受暴力的概率，也让女孩早孕的可能提高了90 % 。
The likely result is a larger family that demands more unpaid childcare, thereby undermining educational attainment and reinforcing the gender pay gap.	其可能的结果包括规模更大的家庭，从而需要更多无薪育儿活动，进而进一步降低入学率、扩大薪酬的性别差距。
Girls who are married before age 18 also face a severe reduction in mobility, though they are not alone.	18岁前结婚的女孩还面临着流动性大大下降的问题，尽管这一问题并非她们所独有。
A study in South Africa showed that, overall, girls face a drastic reduction in access to the public sphere – with spatial access falling from an area of 6.3 square miles to just 2.6 – when they reach puberty.	一项南非的研究表明，总体而言，女孩面临着公开露面机会，在她们进入青春期后呈现出剧烈下降 — — 其活动空间从6.3平方英里下降到2.6平方英里。
Spatial access for boys, by contrast, more than doubles, from 3.8 square miles to 7.8, when they are seen as becoming men.	相反，男孩公开露面的机会，在他们被视为男人之后，会出现倍增，从3.8平方英里增加到7.8平方英里。
Reduced mobility for girls puts them at risk of social isolation and limits their opportunities to build social capital.	女孩流动性的下降让她们很容易面临社会孤立，限制了她们构建社会资本的机会。
As a result of these and other factors, only 47% of women in low- and middle-income countries are now in the labor force, compared to 79% of men.	拜这些和其他因素所赐，只有47%的中低收入国家妇女参与了劳动力，而男性为79 % 。
My research team estimates that if we cut the labor-force participation gap by just half – from 32 percentage points to 16% – GDP in the affected countries would increase by 15% in the first year alone, adding $4 trillion to global GDP.	我的研究团队估算如能让劳动力参与率差距减小一半 — — 从32个百分点下降为16个百分点 — — 受影响国家的GDP在第一年就能增加15 % ， 全球GDP可以增加4万亿美元。
Giving girls the skills and knowledge they need to become productive individuals who can participate in the twenty-first-century economy empowers them in all aspects of their lives, enabling them to contribute to their families, communities, and economies in ways they choose.	给予女孩需要的技能和知识，让她们变成有生产力、能够参与到二十一世纪经济中的个体，可以提高她们生活中全方位的能力，让她们按照自己选择的道路，为家庭、社区和经济做出贡献。
It is the right thing to do for global development – and for girls and women themselves.	这是全球发展应该做的事 — — 也是应该为女孩和妇女本身做的事。
A growing number of governments, foundations, companies, and communities recognize this, and are now investing in girls’ health, education, and wellbeing.	越来越多的政府、基金会、公司和社区已经认识到这一点，正在投资于女孩的健康、教育和福利。
But considerable resources are being channeled toward ineffective approaches or – worse – programs that have been proved not to work.	但大量资源被用在了无效的方法，甚至更糟糕地，被用在了被证明毫无用处的计划上。
And too many well-meaning development actors regard girls as victims to be saved, rather than as the innovative, energetic game changers they are.	而太多怀着良好初衷的发展行动方将女孩视为需要拯救的受害者，而不是她们理应成为的有创造力、充满能量的局面改变因素。
So how can we best expand opportunities for girls?	那么，我们如何更好地扩大女孩的机会？
We know, for example, that educating girls may be the most cost-effective investment for promoting economic development.	比如，我们知道，教育女孩也许是促进经济发展性价比最高的投资。
We also know that girls, including those with children of their own, benefit considerably from access to sexual and reproductive information and services, which enable them to choose the size and structure of their families and ensure their own health and wellbeing.	我们也知道，女孩，包括已经有了自己孩子的女孩，可以通过性和生殖知识和服务的普及而获得巨大的好处，这些知识和服务让她们能够选择家庭的规模和结构，也有助于确保她们自身的健康和福利。
But girls’ advocates – in governments, non-governmental organizations, and development and funding agencies – struggle daily with meeting these needs.	但女孩的支持者 — — 不论是政府、非政府组织还是发展和融资机构 — — 都在为了满足这些需要而奔波。
And, despite recognizing the multifaceted and interconnected nature of girls’ needs, we often struggle in silos, working on the same problems without communicating with one another.	而尽管认识到女孩的需要具有多面性和联动性，但我们却常常单枪匹马，各自为政地致力于同样的问题，而不互相沟通。
This lack of effective coordination, collaboration, or knowledge sharing carries through to investments, which often end up narrowly focused on a single project, sector, or geographic area – often weakening their effectiveness.	缺乏有效的合作、协调或知识共享的问题贯穿于投资的整个过程，常常导致狭隘地地关注一个项目、一个部门或一个地区 — — 从而影响了它们的效果。
That’s why the Population Council created the Girl Innovation, Research, and Learning (GIRL) Center, a kind of global knowledge hub for girl-centered research and programming.	因此，人口委员会（Population Council）成立了女孩创新、研究和学习中心（Girl Innovation, Research, and Learning Center，GIRL中心 ） ， 这是一个以女孩为中心的研究和规划的全球知识俱乐部。
The GIRL Center, which I direct, aims to make the most of the world’s investments in girls, both by supporting evidence-based policies and by aligning the goals and priorities of various stakeholders.	GIRL中心由我负责领导，它的目标是通过支持基于证据的政策和协调目标与不同相关利益方的重点，让世界对女孩的投资效果最大化。
To that end, we are building the world’s largest open data repository on adolescents, curating the Population Council’s records on more than 120,000 individuals of adolescent age, as well as data from other organizations working on girl-centered research and programs.	为了实现这个目标，我们正在建立全球最大的开放青少年数据库，管理人口委员会保存的120,000多位青春期个体的记录，以及来自其他致力于以女孩为中心的研究和计划的组织的数据。
The repository will enable rigorous analyses that provide policymakers with a deeper understanding of how girls’ lives and needs evolve during adolescence and which interventions are most effective for which groups (and under which conditions).	该数据库可以带来细致的分析，为决策者提供更加深刻的关于女孩的生活和需求如何在青春期变化，以及哪些干预对哪些群体（以及在哪些条件下）最为有效的认识。
It will also connect people from different disciplines and sectors united by the goal of promoting systemic changes that give adolescents, especially girls, the opportunity to fulfill their potential.	它还能将来自不同学科和部门的人联系起来，让他们团结在促进青少年尤其是女孩充分实现潜力的系统性变化周围。
Empowering girls to use their energies and talents to transform their societies will not be easy.	向女孩赋权，利用她们的能量和才华改变她们的社会，这绝非易事。
The key is to pursue a comprehensive approach – one that recognizes the fundamental linkages among programs and objectives, takes advantage of proven solutions, and adopts a long-term perspective.	关键在于采取全面的方法 — — 这一方法要认识不同计划和目标之间的基本联系，利用被证明行之有效的方案，并采取长期视角。
	
Sympathy for the Migrant	同情移民遭遇
GENEVA – The tragic fate of the several hundred Africans who drowned near the Italian island of Lampedusa in October made international headlines, leading to a rare moment of compassion and reflection about the dangers facing many migrants.	日内瓦 — — 十月数百名非洲移民淹死在意大利兰佩杜萨岛附近水域的悲惨命运登上了国际头条，并罕见地引发了人们对移民危险境遇的同情与思考。
But the only exceptional aspect of this disaster was the magnitude of the death toll.	但死亡人数之多是这次灾难唯一的特殊之处。
For Lampedusa’s residents, shipwrecks involving refugees and migrants are a common occurrence: a week later, a boat carrying Syrian and Palestinian refugees capsized off the shores of the island, leaving more than 30 people dead.	对兰佩杜萨岛居民而言，涉及难民和移民的沉船事故其实是家常便饭：短短一周后，又有一艘载有叙利亚和巴勒斯坦难民的船只在岛屿海岸线外倾覆，造成超过30人死亡。
The year 2013 demonstrated, as if any further demonstration were needed, that these catastrophes are not restricted to European shores or to the Mediterranean Sea.	2013年类似悲剧表明上述灾难并不限于欧洲或地中海海岸，但之前的无数次事故其实早就已经证明了这一点。
In November, nearly 30 Haitians perished when their boat ran aground on its way to the United States – the third case in the northern Caribbean since October.	11月，一艘满载移民的船只在美国海岸搁浅导致近30名海地人丧生 — — 这是10月以来加勒比海北部发生的第三起类似事件。
Along the Mexico-US border, the deployment of sophisticated border controls leads people to starve while attempting passage in the desert’s remotest stretches.	沿墨美边境部署的复杂边境控制导致试图穿越偏远沙漠的移民活活饿死在路上。
In the Asia-Pacific region, hundreds of migrants and refugees have drowned this year in the Bay of Bengal or while trying to reach Australia.	在亚太地区，今年已经有数百名试图偷渡澳大利亚的移民及难民淹死在孟加拉湾。
Wealthy states and regions face the dilemma of designing border controls that reflect not only the needs and demands of their populations, but also their responsibility to those seeking to enter their territory.	富裕国家地区陷入到边境控制不仅要满足本国人口需要、而且要承担对偷渡入境者责任的两难局面。
None of this is new: ever since national frontiers were invented, people have been crossing them, whether formally or under the radar.	这些问题其实早已是老生常谈：国界发明后就有人试图越境，无论是办理正规手续还是偷偷摸摸。
Whether they have done so in search of economic opportunities or to escape violence or environmental disasters, host countries have reacted with a mix of welcome and wariness.	无论移民想要寻找经济机会还是躲避暴力或环境灾难，东道国的反应往往是欢迎和谨慎相结合。
States that tighten their borders encourage desperate people, exploited by cynical smugglers and traffickers, to take greater risks to cross them.	收紧边界控制的国家只能鼓励绝望者冒着风险非法越境，成为玩世不恭的走私者和人贩子的利用对象。
As the International Organization for Migration stated shortly after the Lampedusa tragedy, implementation of enhanced border controls “did not have sufficient impact or decrease the number of arrivals to the South of Europe in the long run.	正像国际移民组织在兰佩杜萨悲剧发生后不久所指出的那样，加强边境控制“从长期看既不会显著影响也不会减少南欧移民的数量。
On the contrary, migrants started to explore alternative and mostly dangerous routes with a frequent rate of deaths at sea.”	相反，移民却开始探索更加危险的替代路线，从而导致频繁出现海上死亡 。 ”
Of course, not all migrants are refugees or require protection.	当然，并不是所有移民都是难民或者需要保护。
In fact, migrants on the same boat may have very different motives – what policymakers call “mixed migration.”	事实上，同一条船上的移民动机可能截然不同 — — 这就是决策者所说的“混合移民潮 ” 。
But, faced with a complex picture, states have tended to address the flow of migrants they deem undesirable by saying, in effect, “out of sight, out of mind.”	但因为情况过于复杂，国家往往倾向于以“眼不见、心不烦”的态度来对待不受欢迎的移民流动。
This is especially true when domestic anti-immigrant sentiment spikes, typically during economic downturns like the one that many regions currently are experiencing.	国内反移民情绪高涨时尤其如此，特别是在很多地区都陷入到经济衰退之后。
A single-minded focus on sealing borders – a particularly worrying trend in states’ approach to migration controls today – tends to regard migrants as unwanted trespassers even before their status can be determined, their rights upheld, or their contributions acknowledged.	今天各国政府移民控制工作尤其令人担忧的趋势是一意孤行封锁边界，甚至在弄清情况、维护权利或认可贡献之前，就先把移民视为不必要的入侵者。
It may also discourage people from helping the vulnerable: there are reports in the Mediterranean of private vessels avoiding migrant boats in distress for fear of being reprimanded by European border patrols.	这样也会导致民众不愿帮助弱势群体：有报道称见到地中海私人船只绕开遇险移民船，目的是避免受到欧洲边境巡逻部队的申斥。
We must recognize the desperation of those who attempt these journeys.	我们必须理解非法移民的绝望。
From friends or from the media, they know what awaits them.	他们从朋友或媒体那里知道等待自己的命运是什么。
They are aware of the risks and have heard the horror stories.	他们了解其中的风险，也听到过令人不寒而栗的报道。
Seeing their options for passage narrowing, they put themselves at the mercy of unscrupulous smugglers, often at enormous expense.	因为入境的可能性越来越小，他们被迫付出巨大代价，把自己交给不法走私分子任其摆布。
They are crammed onto precarious ships that cannot bear the load.	他们被迫人满为患地挤在摇摇欲坠的船上。
They travel at night, when neither border police nor rescue operations can see them.	为避开边防警察他们只能在夜间航行，但也因此无法得到救援人员的帮助。
Equally important, governments should view migration as a profoundly binding dimension of the human experience.	同样重要是，政府应当将移民视为不可避免的人类活动。
Through migration, human beings share an understanding of sorrow, hope, and compassion.	人类通过移民对悲伤、希望和同情有了共同的理解。
Indeed, this understanding has inspired some of the international community’s greatest feats of solidarity, such as the 1951 Refugee Convention, which defines a person’s right to find safe havens across borders.	事实上，这样的理解曾经激发了国际社会最伟大的团结壮举，如签署《1951年难民公约 》 ， 规定民众有权跨国寻求庇护。
The continuing rise in migrant deaths in transit poses a conundrum: as these migrants are pushed toward trafficking and smuggling networks, they are dragged further into the grey areas of the international community’s response.	越来越多人死于运输途中也给人们出了一道难题：随着不断被推向走私贩运网络，移民也被更深地拖入到国际反应的灰色地带当中。
For example, the European Union’s border police do not have clear search-and-rescue guidelines for migrant ships in distress.	比方说欧盟边境警察没有针对遇难移民船明确的搜救规定。
Member states are divided on how to address this, and recent discussions in Brussels have only begun to make some progress.	各国在这个问题上互有分歧，最近布鲁塞尔的讨论才刚刚开始取得成果。
As 2014 begins, the world needs clearer lines of responsibility for averting further tragedies.	2014年到来之际，为了避免上演更多悲剧世界需要明确划分责任。
As an international community, we owe migrants and refugees greater compassion.	国际社会应给予移民和难民更多同情。
Otherwise, we will continue to wake, every so often, to find a graveyard on our shores.	否则，我们醒来时会时常发现海滩已经变成坟场。
	
West Africa’s Misguided War on Drugs	非洲毒品战之误
ACCRA – A recent estimate by the United Kingdom’s Office for National Statistics that the market for illegal drugs adds £4.4 billion ($7.6 billion) annually to the country’s economy gives a sense of the astonishing scale of the illicit narcotics trade.	阿克拉—英国国家统计办公室的最新测算表明，非法毒品市场每年给英国经济带来44亿英镑，这一结果揭开了巨大的非法毒品贸易冰山之一角。
For regions such as West Africa, with economies that are neither as large nor as developed as the UK’s, the impact of such activity can be even more corrosive.	西非等地区不比英国大，也没有英国发达，非法毒品交易活动却可能更加猖獗。
West Africa finds itself increasingly enmeshed in the global drug trade.	西非在全球毒品贸易中越陷越深。
Its location makes it vulnerable to being exploited as a transit point between the Latin American and Asian production centers and consumer markets in Europe and the United States.	地理位置决定了它很容易沦为从拉美和亚洲生产中心到欧洲和美国消费市场的中转站。
But, as the experience of Central America shows, transit countries do not serve only as a corridor for drugs.	但是，正如中非经验所表明的，中转国并不仅仅是毒品的走廊。
Illegal drugs and the money that surround them invade and destabilize their societies.	非法毒品以及其中所涉及的金钱腐蚀和动摇着中转国社会。
This disturbing development – a byproduct of the failed “global war on drugs” – threatens to reverse recent economic and social gains in our region.	这一破坏性发展趋势 — — “全球毒品战”失败的副产品 — — 有可能逆转我们地区最近的经济和社会繁荣之势。
So far, West Africa has avoided the worst of the endemic and routine violence that accompanies the passage of drugs through Central America.	目前，西非避免了毒品穿越中非过程中所伴随的无时无处不在的暴力活动。
But, with the stakes so high, there is no room for complacency.	但是，兹事体大，西非不能因此自满。
The scale of the cocaine trade alone in West Africa dwarfs the combined government budgets of several countries in the region.	西非的可卡因贸易量足以令该地区属国的预算总和相形见绌。
We already know that the narcotics trade has played a direct or indirect role in political upheaval in countries such as Guinea-Bissau and Mali.	我们已经知道，毒品贸易在几内亚比绍和马里等国家的政治动乱中起着直接或间接的作用。
National and international action against the traffickers must be stepped up, and it should include targeting those who run the networks, rather than expending scarce law-enforcement resources to pursue their foot soldiers.	国家和国际层面的缉毒行动必须有所升级，并且对象应该包括贩毒网络经营者，而不应该将宝贵的执法资源消耗在追捕小喽啰上。
We need to pursue those who gain the most, whoever they are and whatever position they hold.	我们需要追捕从毒品贸易中获益最大的，不管他们是谁、地位多高。
But it is not only the trade in illegal drugs that is destabilizing countries in the region; narcotics consumption is becoming a major problem as well.	但动摇该地区国家的不仅仅是非法毒品贸易；毒品消费也称为重大问题。
The West Africa Commission on Drugs, which I convened and former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo chairs, points out in a new report that cocaine, heroin, and locally produced methamphetamines have become increasingly available across the region.	由我发起、前尼日利亚总统���巴桑约（Olusegun Obasanjo）担任主席的西非毒品委员会（West Africa Commission on Drugs）在新报告中指出，可卡因、海洛因以及本地生产的甲基苯丙胺在西非地区越来越容易获得。
This has led to greater use and dependence, especially among the region’s young people.	这导致了用量和依赖程度的上升，特别是在年轻人当中。
Yet the region is simply not ready or equipped to deal with the spread of drug use and dependency.	但西非地区并没有做好准备，也没有条件应对毒品使用和依赖的日益蔓延之势。
All too often, the response is to stigmatize and penalize drug users.	所采取的的应对措施往往是羞辱和惩罚吸毒者。
But pushing them to the fringes of society or locking them up in ever increasing numbers will not solve the problem.	但边缘化吸毒者、将越来越大的吸毒群体隔离起来并不能解决问题。
On the contrary, it worsens health problems and puts enormous pressure on West Africa’s already over-stretched criminal justice systems.	相反，这恶化了健康问题，也给西非已然不堪重负的刑事司法体系带来了巨大压力。
The Commission’s report instead calls for a new approach to drug abuse, one that treats it not as a criminal-justice issue, but rather as a public-health problem.	西非毒品委员会的报告因此呼吁采取新方针应对毒品泛滥，该方针不把毒品泛滥视为刑事司法问题，而是视为公共卫生问题。
That means tackling the near total absence of drug-treatment facilities and programs and the lack of personnel qualified to manage and monitor drug abuse.	这意味着要解决毒品治疗设施和计划几乎完全缺位的问题以及缺乏能够管理和监控毒品滥用情况的人手的问题。
The Commission accepts that there are many urgent demands on strapped health-care budgets.	毒品委员会认同医疗预算少而需求迫切的问题。
But such is the importance of this challenge – and so dire are the consequences of failure to overcome it – that the Commission strongly recommends the adoption of a drug-treatment policy with minimum standards across the region.	但这一挑战极其重要 — — 并且若无法克服，后果将十分严重 — — 因此委员会强烈建议在整个地区采取毒品治疗政策的最低标准。
This includes the establishment of drug treatment and related health services and facilities, and the implementation of harm-reduction approaches, such as needle-exchange programs, which have been proven to reduce the spread of HIV and the incidence of drug-related deaths.	这其中包括建立毒品治疗站和相关医疗服务和设施，并实施降低伤害措施，如换针（needle-exchange）计划。 换针计划已被证明能够降低艾滋病的传播和与毒品有关的死亡案例。
To date, Senegal is alone in West Africa in implementing some form of government-run harm-reduction initiative.	目前，西非只有塞内加尔实施了某种形式的国营伤害降低计划。
Tackling the impact of drugs through informed, humane, and coordinated policy will require leadership and a concerted effort by countries across the region.	通过知情、人道和协作的政策处理毒品的影响需要领导力和全地区各国的共同努力。
The Commission calls for a shared commitment from governments, civil-society groups, and regional organizations.	西非毒品委员会呼吁各国政府、公民社会组织和地区组织作出共同承诺。
We can no longer sweep this issue under the carpet or pretend that it is not our problem.	我们不能再掩盖这一问题，或装作这不是我们的问题。
The report also urges increased support for these efforts from the international community.	报告还敦促国际社会为这方面的措施提供更多的支持。
Governments in those West African countries that are the principal producers and consumers of illegal drugs should fund prevention, treatment, and harm-reduction initiatives, rather than only investing in interdiction and law enforcement.	身为非法毒品主要生产国和消费国的西非国家政府应该为预防、治疗和减少伤害机制提供资金，而不仅仅是投资于缉毒和执法。
Without a change of direction, drug trafficking, production, and consumption in West Africa will continue to undermine institutions, threaten public health, and damage development progress.	如果不改变方向，西非地区的毒品走私、制造和消费就将继续破坏制度、威胁公共卫生、威胁发展进步。
But reforming drug laws, offering chronic users proper treatment, and vigorously pursuing high-level drug traffickers will reduce the damaging impact of illegal drugs on communities, families, and individuals.	但改革毒品法、为慢性瘾君子提供适当治疗以及严打追捕高级别毒贩能够降低非法毒品对社会、家庭和个人的伤害。
By having the courage to refocus national and international efforts, we can help to ensure that our young people grow up healthy and secure.	若能鼓起勇气集中于国家和国际层面的努力，我们能够帮助确保我们的年青一代成长在健康和安全的环境中。
	
India’s Jewel in the Crown	皇冠上的印度宝石
NEW DELHI – India’s Solicitor-General, Ranjit Kumar, recently declared that India would not seek the return of the Kohinoor diamond – one of the world’s oldest and most valuable – from the British, to whom India had “gifted” it.	新德里—印度司法部副部长兰吉特·库马尔（Ranjit Kumar）最近宣称印度不会寻求向英国人要回印度“送给”它的克西努尔钻石（Kohinoor，世界上最古老、最值钱的钻石之一 ） 。
The statement shocked India and unleashed passionate debate – so passionate, in fact, that the government scrambled to declare that it still wants the gem back.	这一声明震惊了印度，引起了热烈争论 — — 事实上，太过热烈以至于政府不得不宣布仍然想要回这颗宝石。
But the government’s commitment to securing that outcome remains unconvincing, at best.	但印度政府对这一结果的保证并不令人信服。
Kumar was responding before the Supreme Court to a suit filed by the All India Human Rights and Social Justice Front, an NGO, demanding that the government seek the return of the famed diamond, which can be found among Britain’s crown jewels.	库马尔是在最高法院前回应全印人民人权和社会正义阵线（All India Human Rights and Social Justice Front，一家非政府组织）要求政府寻求要回这颗被镶在英国皇冠上的著名钻石的上诉时说这番话的。
He claims that the erstwhile Sikh kingdom offered the gem to the British East India Company in 1849 as “voluntary compensation” for the expenses of the just-concluded Anglo-Sikh wars.	他说，1849年，当时的锡克王国将这个钻石作为刚刚结束的盎格鲁-锡克战争的“自愿赔款”送给英国东印度公司的。
Add to that the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act of 1972, which does not permit the government to seek the return of antiquities exported before India gained its independence in 1947, and, according to Kumar, the Indian government has no recourse to secure the diamond’s return.	此外， 1972年古董和艺术珍品法（Antiquities and Art Treasures Act of 1972）禁止印度政府寻求要回1947年印度独立前输出国外的古董，并且据库马尔所言，印度政府也没有能保证钻石回归的能力。
The uproar that Kumar’s statement triggered has forced government spokesmen to backpedal furiously, asserting that Kumar’s was not the final official view.	库马尔的声明所引起的轩然大波迫使政府发言人不得不紧急“救火 ” ， 说库马尔并不代表最终官方观点。
The Ministry of Culture announced that a claim will still be pursued.	文化部长宣布，印度仍将追求钻石索偿权。
But unless Kumar is instructed to file a new deposition before the Supreme Court, his statements appear to have put paid to India’s claim to the world’s most fabled diamond.	但除非库马尔被要求在最高法院前做出新的陈述，否则他的声明可视为已经放弃了印度对全世界最具传说色彩的钻石的索偿权。
So the question is whether that should indeed be the final outcome.	因此，问题在于这是否应该成为最终结果。
The Kohinoor was first mined by the Kakatiya dynasty near Guntur, in what is now Andhra Pradesh.	克西努尔最初由卡卡提亚（Kakatiya）王朝在贡土尔（今安得拉邦）发掘。
The Kakatiya kings installed it in a temple, which was raided by Delhi Sultan Alauddin Khilji, who took it back to his capital along with other plundered treasures.	卡卡提亚国王将它供奉在庙宇中，后来被德里苏丹西尔基（Alauddin Khilji）掠得，和其他战利品一起带回了他的都城。
It passed into the possession of the Mughal Empire that established itself in Delhi in the sixteenth century.	后来，克西努尔在十六世纪建立于德里的莫卧儿帝国传承。
In 1739, the Kohinoor fell into the hands of the Persian invader Nadir Shah, whose loot from his conquest of Delhi (and decimation of its inhabitants) also included the priceless Peacock Throne.	1739年，克西努尔落到了入侵的波斯奈迪尔沙（Nadir Shah）手中，奈迪尔沙征服德里（和大量屠杀其居民）的战利品还包括无价之宝孔雀王座。
It was Nadir Shah, or so legend has it, who baptized the diamond the Kohinoor, or “Mountain of Light.”	据传，奈迪尔沙给钻石命名为克西努尔，意思是“光明之山 ” 。
One of his consorts memorably and colorfully stated, “If a strong man were to throw four stones – one north, one south, one east, one west – and a fifth stone up into the air, and if the space between them were to be filled with gold, it would not equal the value of the Kohinoor.”	他的一位妃子令人难忘地生动地说 ， “ 如果一位征服者向四周 — — 北、南、东、西各扔一颗石头，在向空中扔一颗石头，然后把这五颗石头中间的空间全部用黄金填满，也抵不上克西努尔的价值 。 ”
Upon Nadir Shah’s death in 1747, the diamond fell into the hands of one of his generals, Ahmad Shah Durrani, who became the Emir of Afghanistan.	1747年奈迪尔沙驾崩，钻石落到了其部将、阿富汗埃米尔艾哈迈德沙杜兰尼（Ahmad Shah Durrani）手中。
In 1809, one of Durrani’s descendants was obliged to cede the Kohinoor in tribute to the powerful Sikh Maharaja of Punjab, Ranjit Singh.	1809年，杜兰尼的后代被迫让出克西努尔，进贡给强大的旁遮普锡克大君兰吉特·辛格（Ranjit Singh ） 。
But Singh’s successors could not hold on to his kingdom.	但辛格的继任者无法维持他的王国。
The Sikhs were defeated by the British in two wars, culminating in the British Empire’s annexation of the Sikh domains in 1849.	锡克人被英国人在两场战争中击败，1849年大英帝国吞并了锡克领土。
That was when the Kohinoor was supposedly “gifted” to the British.	克西努尔也在这时候据说被“送给”了英国人。
The argument that the diamond was offered as “voluntary compensation” for the expenses the British incurred in defeating the Sikhs is ridiculous.	克西努尔作为英国击败锡克人的“自愿补偿”送给英国的说法是荒谬可笑的。
For starters, the formal handover was conducted by the last Maharaja of the Sikh Empire, Duleep Singh, who was only ten years old – and most certainly was not given a choice.	首先，进行正式转交的是锡克帝国末代大君杜力普·辛格（Duleep Singh ） ， 当时只有十岁 — — 很有可能根本没得选择。
As I have pointed out to other Indian politicians, if you hold a gun to my head, I might give you my wallet, but that doesn’t make it a gift – and it doesn’t mean I shouldn’t get it back.	我向其他印度政客说过，如果你拿枪指着我的头，我肯定会把我的钱包给你，但这不叫送给你 — — 也不意味着我不应该把它拿回来。
Compensation provided to the winners of a war by those they defeated is usually known as reparations, which are not entirely voluntary.	战败者向战胜者提供的补偿常常被称为赔款，完全不是自愿的。
And, in fact, many former colonies rightly argue that it is Britain that owes them reparations for centuries of oppression and looting.	而事实上，许多前殖民地正确地指出，英国对它们进行了数百年的压迫和掠夺，应该向它们赔款。
Returning priceless artifacts of cultural significance purloined at the height of imperial rule might be a good place to start.	要回帝国统治顶峰时期被抢走的含有文化意义的无价珍品是一个良好的开端。
To be sure, the Kohinoor poses a particular challenge, owing to competing claims.	诚然，由于存在多重竞争性索偿权，克西努尔钻石是一个特殊的挑战。
The Iranians say that Nadir Shah stole it fair and square, while the Afghans assert that the Sikhs forced them to surrender it.	伊朗人说，奈迪儿沙光明正大地窃取（stole）了它，而阿富汗人认为锡克人强迫他们交出了它。
Now Pakistan has entered the ring, with the somewhat flimsy argument that the capital of the Sikh Empire, the undisputed last pre-British owners, was in Lahore.	现在，巴基斯坦也加入了竞争，提出了不太站得住脚的主张，指出英国人之前无可置疑的所有者锡克帝国的首都就在拉合尔。
(They tend to gloss over the fact that, after decades of ethnic cleansing in Pakistan, hardly any Sikhs are left there.)	（他们想要掩饰一个事实，即在经历了几十年的种族清洗后，巴基斯坦已经几乎没有锡克人了。
But, given that the diamond spent most of its existence on or beneath Indian soil, Indians consider their claim self-evident.	）但是，由于到这颗钻石在其生命的绝大部分时间里都埋在印度国土地下，印度人认为他们拥有理所当然的索偿权。
For the British, however, the existence of contending claims is a major relief, as it helps the country to fend off a blizzard of demands to undo the manifold injustices of two or more centuries of colonial exploitation of far-flung lands.	但是，对英国人来说，存在互相竞争的索偿主张令它大舒一口气，这有助于英国抵挡蜂拥而至的对两个或更多世纪的对遥远殖民地的掠夺所带来的各种不公平拨乱反正的要求。
The British expropriation of other peoples’ patrimony, from the Parthenon Marbles to the Kohinoor diamond, is a particular point of contention, as conceding any one item could, the British fear, open a Pandora’s box of problems.	英国对其他民族祖先遗产的征用 — — 从巴特农神庙大理石到克西努尔钻石—���是一个极具争议性的点，英国人担心，在其中一个物品上做出让步就会打开潘多拉魔盒。
Indeed, on a 2010 visit to India, Prime Minister David Cameron declared outright that the Kohinoor would have to “stay put,” because “if you say yes to one, you would suddenly find the British Museum would be empty.”	事实上，英国首相卡梅伦在2010年访问印度时明确宣布，克西努尔必须“原封不动 ” ， 因为“如果你想一个人说了‘是 ’ ， 你就会突然发现，大英博物馆将被掏空 。 ”
With Kumar having essentially taken Britain’s side on the Kohinoor issue, albeit for different reasons, nationalists like me are losing hope that we will get that priceless element of our heritage back.	库马尔在克西努尔问题上其实是站在了英国一边，尽管原因不同；这让我这样的民族主义者对于要回我们的遗产的这一无价之宝深感希望大减。
Britain owes us.	英国人欠我们的。
But, instead of returning the evidence of their rapacity to their rightful owners, the British are flaunting the Kohinoor on the Queen Mother’s crown in the Tower of London.	但是，英国人并没有像正确的所有者返回他们掠夺的证物，而是将克西努尔镶嵌伦敦塔的皇太后皇冠上。
It is a stark reminder of what colonialism truly was: shameless subjugation, coercion, and misappropriation.	这鲜明地提醒我们殖民主义的本质：厚颜无耻的征服、强迫和侵占。
Perhaps that is the best argument for leaving the Kohinoor in Britain, where it emphatically does not belong.	也许这是让克西努尔留在英国的最好的理由 — — 强调它并不属于那里。
	
Grading Abenomics	给安倍经济学打分
TOKYO – It has been almost a year since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe launched his plan to lift Japan’s economy out of two decades of deflation and recession.	东京—自首相安倍晋三抛出其日本经济走出二十年通��和衰退计划以来已经过去了近一年时间。
How has “Abenomics” fared so far?	“安倍经济学”进展如何？
Answering this question requires breaking Abenomics down into its three components – massive monetary easing, expansionary fiscal policy, and a long-term growth strategy – which Abe, referring to the tale of Motonari Mori, a sixteenth-century daimyo (feudal lord), calls the “three arrows.”	要回答这个问题，需要将安倍经济学分解为三个成分 — — 大规模货币宽松、扩张性财政政策，以及长期增长战略 — — 安倍晋三援引十六世纪大名毛利元就的传说称之为“三支箭 ” 。
According to legend, Mori instructed each of his three sons to snap an arrow in half.	传说毛利元就让三个儿子各自将一支箭折断。
After they had succeeded, he told them to tie three arrows together, and break the whole bundle at once; none was able to do it.	成功后，毛利元就又让儿子们将三支箭绑在一起折，没人能够折断。
Like Mori’s three arrows, the three arrows of Abenomics are supposed to reinforce each other.	像毛利的三支箭一样，安倍经济学的三支箭也应该是互相强化的。
But Mori’s arrows were bound together in parallel, whereas Abe’s policy arrows are connected through underlying structural relationships.	但毛利的箭平行地绑在一起，而安倍的政策之箭是通过基础结构关系联系在一起。
While the first and second arrows aim to transform Japan’s actual growth path, the third operates on the economy’s potential growth path, which assumes the optimal use of all available resources and technologies.	第一支和第二支箭的目标是转变日本的实际增长路径，而第三支箭 — — 实现所有可用资源和技术的最优用途 — — 要改变日本经济的潜在增长路径。
Since Abenomics was launched, the “deflation gap” (the difference between actual and potential output) has dropped from roughly three percentage points to below 1.5.	自安倍经济学出台以来 ， “ 通缩缺口 ” （ 实际和潜在产出之差）从大约三个百分点降至1.5个百分点以下 。 。
This implies that, while the first two arrows are helping to improve Japan’s actual growth path, the third arrow has yet to do much for potential growth.	这意味着尽管前两支箭帮助改善了日本的实际增长路径，但第三支箭对于潜在增长并未起到多少作用。
In fact, since Abe’s first arrow took flight, Japan’s stock market has soared with it, recording an unprecedented 40% annual gain, while the yen has depreciated against the dollar by 20%, boosting Japanese firms’ export competitiveness.	事实上，自安倍射出第一支箭以来，日本股市应声大涨，录得前所未有的40%的年涨幅，同时日元对美元贬值20 % ， 提振了日本企业的出口竞争力。
Moreover, credit growth has accelerated and asset prices have risen – trends that will encourage consumption by triggering the wealth effect (when people spend more because they feel richer).	此外，信用增长也有所加速，资产价格有所上涨 — — 这些趋势可以通过触发财富效应（人们感觉变富了，因此花钱更多）鼓励消费。
And monetary expansion is also having a positive impact on the labor market: the unemployment rate has fallen to 4%, and the job-to-applicant ratio is nearing parity.	货币扩张还对劳动力市场产生了积极影响：失业率降至4 % ， 岗位数/求职数接近相等。
With real GDP growth around 4% in the first half of the year (though it did fall below 2% in the third quarter), the first arrow has already hit the bull’s eye – a performance worthy of an A+.	今年上半年真实GDP增长率约为4 % （ 尽管在第三季度又回到了2%以下 ） ， 据此，第一支箭可谓正中目标，可以打一个A+。
The second arrow entails a sharp increase in short-term fiscal expenditure, especially investment in infrastructure projects.	第二支箭包括了短期财政支出的增加，特别是在基础设施项目投资方面。
While those who, like me, adhere to the Mundell-Fleming framework (according to which fiscal stimulus will be offset by the resulting increase in capital inflows, currency appreciation, and reduced export competitiveness) do not stress the impact of flexible fiscal policy, Keynesians take it very seriously.	尽管如我这样的蒙代尔-弗莱明（Meundell-Fleming）框架信奉者 — — 认为财政刺激的效果被其所导致的资本流入、货币升值和出口竞争力降低抵消 — — 并不强调弹性财政政策的效果，但凯恩斯主义者对此十分在意。
On the assumption that faster growth will neutralize any threat to debt sustainability, the second arrow receives a B.	假设更快的增长能够中和任何债务可持续性方面的风险，那么第二支箭可以获得B。
When the first and second arrows lift actual growth above potential growth, monetary expansion will no longer be able to produce substantial GDP or employment gains.	当第一支箭和第二支箭将实际增长提升到了潜在增长之上时，货币扩张就不再能够带来显著的GDP或就业改善。
That is when the third arrow, which aims to boost Japan’s potential growth through structural change (including increased private investment, technological innovation, improved trade links, and reformed corporate-tax policy), will become far more important.	此时，第三支箭的重要性就大大增加了。 第三支箭的目标是通过结构性变化（包括增加私人投资、技术创新、改善贸易联系、改革税收政策等）提振日本的潜在增长。
Abe has set out the vision behind his long-term growth plan.	安倍已经给出了其长期增长计划背后的愿景。
“Japan is a country that challenges, that is open, and that innovates,” he says.	他说 ： “ 日本是一个挑战之国、开放之国、创新之国 。 ”
But many of the details of his strategy remain uncertain.	但他的战略中有很多细节仍不明确。
Japan’s longtime approach to industrial policy, in which the Ministry of International Trade and Industry provided support and subsidies for selected industries, helping them to compete in world markets, is now obsolete (indeed, MITI’s role was taken over by the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry in 2001).	日本产业政策的长期方针 — — 通产省为选定行业提供支持和补贴，帮助它们在世界市场上竞争 — — 如今已经过时（事实上，通产省的角色在2001年已由经济产业省取代 ） 。
When Japanese firms operate at the frontier of industry, bureaucrats cannot choose the winners.	日本企业在行业前沿经营时，官僚不再能够挑选赢家。
Given this, the government’s role should be confined to areas where externalities exist, such as carbon-emissions reduction.	因此，政府的角色应该限定于存在外部性的领域，如减少碳排放等。
Unfortunately, a new, clearly defined approach to industrial policy is still missing.	不幸的是，日本仍没有定义明确的新的产业政策方针。
In fact, descriptions of some third-arrow projects seem to be based on little more than wishful thinking, with new technology or knowhow apparently expected simply to fall into Japan’s lap.	事实上，关于第三支箭中一些项目的描述完全是基于臆测，好像技术和知识必然会自动掉到日本碗里一样。
A more effective approach would entail achievable, concrete goals like relaxing labor- and financial-market regulations, reducing corporate income taxes, liberalizing trade by joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and perhaps easing immigration policy.	更有效的方针应该包括可实现的切实目标，如放松劳动力和金融市场监管、降低公司所得税、加入跨太平洋合作伙伴关系以实现贸易自由等，或许也可以包括放松移民政策。
The problem is that bureaucrats like the power that regulation affords them.	问题在于官僚对于监管所给予他们的权力恋恋不舍。
Indeed, deregulation would require them to put their country’s long-term interests above their own short-term interests – a choice that they have so far resisted.	事实上，去监管话要求他们把日本的长期利益置于他们自身的短期利益之前 — — 到目前为止，他们对此十分抵触。
To paraphrase John F. Kennedy, it is time for Japan’s leaders to ask not what their country can do for its government, but what the government can undo for its country.	改编以下约翰·肯尼迪的话，如今日本领导人不要问国家可以为政府做些什么，而要问政府可以为国家不做些什么。
In this context, the third arrow of Abenomics cannot yet be fairly assessed.	在这样的背景下，安倍经济学的第三支箭无法公正地判分。
While its impact has so far been lacking, it certainly cannot be deemed a failure, with Japan’s top leaders still working tirelessly to build the needed momentum.	其影响远未显现，也显然不能认为已经失败，因为日本最高领导层仍在不懈地试图带来必须的动力。
The most appropriate grade is therefore an “E” for effort.	因此，对他们的努力，最合适的分数是“E ” 。
One hopes that it is an effort that proves adequate to overcome bureaucratic resistance to deregulation in the coming year.	我们希望他们的努力可以在来年克服官僚对去监管话的抵制。
With an A+, a B, and an “E,” Abenomics’s first-year report card reflects important progress, providing plenty of reason for enthusiasm.	一个A+，一个B，一个“E ” ， 安倍经济学的第一年成绩单表现出重要的进步，我们有足够的理由看好它。
It even spells its originator’s name.	而ABE正好也是“安倍”的罗马字母拼法。
	
Who’s Afraid of Tapering?	谁在害怕退出？
TOKYO – The US Federal Reserve’s gradual exit from so-called quantitative easing (QE) – open-ended purchases of long-term assets – has financial markets and policymakers worried, with warnings of capital flight from developing economies and collapsing asset prices dominating policy discussions worldwide.	东京—美联储的逐渐退出所谓量化宽松（QE，即无限期购买长期资产）让金融市场和决策者担忧不已，关于资本将从发达经济体外逃、资产价格将崩溃的警告充斥着全世界的政策讨论。
But, given that most major economies operate under a flexible exchange-rate regime, these concerns are largely unwarranted.	但是，大部分主要经济体是在浮动汇率制度下运转的，这些担忧基本上都是无稽之谈。
The logic behind the fear of the Fed’s “tapering” of QE is straightforward.	美联储“退出”QE的恐慌背后的逻辑是显而易见的。
Unconventional monetary policy in the United States – and in other advanced countries, particularly the United Kingdom and Japan – drove down domestic interest rates, while flooding international financial markets with liquidity.	美国（以及其他发达国家，特别是英国和日本）的非常规货币政策降低了国内利率，同时也让流动性在全球金融市场上泛滥。
In search of higher yields, investors took that liquidity – largely in the form of short-term speculative capital (“hot” money) – to emerging markets, putting upward pressure on their exchange rates and fueling the risk of asset bubbles.	寻找更高收益率的投资者带着这一流动性 — — 大部分是短期投机性资本 （ “ 热”钱）来到新兴市场，给它们的汇率造成了升值风险，也助长了资产泡沫风险。
Thus, the Fed’s withdrawal from QE would be accompanied by a capital-flow reversal, increasing borrowing costs and hampering GDP growth.	因此，美联储的退出QE将伴随资本流的逆转，提高借贷成本、妨碍GDP增长。
Of course, not all emerging markets, according to this logic, are equally exposed.	当然，根据这一逻辑，并非所有新兴市场都存在相同的风险。
Among the most vulnerable countries are Turkey, South Africa, Brazil, India, and Indonesia – the so-called “Fragile Five” – all of which are characterized by twin fiscal and current-account deficits, high inflation, in addition to faltering GDP growth.	风险最高的国家是土耳其、南非、巴西、印度和印尼，即所谓的“脆弱五国 ” ， 它们都存在财政和经常项目双重赤���、高企的通胀以及萎靡不振的GDP增长。
This logic would be correct if the world were operating under a fixed exchange-rate regime, with governments tying official exchange rates to another country’s currency or the price of gold.	如果世界是在固定汇率下运转，那么这一逻辑是正确的。 在固定汇率下，政府的官方利率会盯住另一个国家的货币或黄金价格。
Under these conditions, monetary contraction (or slowing expansion) would have a recessionary (or a less stimulative) impact on other economies.	在这样的条件下，货币收缩（或缓慢扩张）会给其他经济体带来衰退（或更小的刺激）效应。
With flexible exchange rates, however, monetary-policy contraction in a major economy would stimulate other economies in the short run, while monetary expansion would damage their performance.	但是，在浮动汇率下，主要经济体的货币政策收缩在短期会刺激其他经济体，而货币扩张则会影响它们的表现。
(To be sure, in the medium or long run, monetary expansion can facilitate increased domestic production and trade, thereby generating positive spillover effects.)	（确实，在中长期，货币扩张能有利于增加国内产出和贸易，从而产生积极的溢出效应。 ）
After the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, the rapid expansion of the money supply in the US and the UK triggered a sharp appreciation of the Japanese yen, as well as of some emerging-market currencies.	2008年雷曼兄弟倒闭后，美国和英国的快速货币扩张触发了日元和一些新兴市场货币的急剧升值。
In short, QE is what merits concern – not its termination.	简言之，QE，而不是退出QE，才是应该担心的东西。
Of course, the Fed’s policy reversal could hurt countries that maintain fixed – or, like China, “managed floating” – exchange rates.	当然，美联储的政策逆转可能伤害一些保持固定汇率的国家 — — 或者中国这样的“管理浮动”汇率国家。
Likewise, weaker eurozone economies like Greece and Spain, which would prefer stronger monetary stimulus than their more competitive counterparts in Europe are willing to accept, may suffer.	类似地，比竞争力更强的欧洲邻国更喜欢较强货币刺激的希腊和西班牙等欧元区疲软经济体也会蒙受损失。
But, given that these economies have chosen to adhere to a fixed exchange rate, the Fed cannot really be blamed for the fallout.	但是，由于这些经济体是自己选择了固定汇率的，因此它们被波及到不能归咎于美联储。
In fact, the Fed – and other advanced-country central banks – should not be blamed for the negative effects of monetary expansion, either.	事实上，美联储（以及其他发达国家央行）也不必为货币扩张的消极效应担责。
Japan’s bold monetary easing, for example, was a critical element of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s strategy for lifting the Japanese economy out of more than a decade of recession – and it has led to a remarkable recovery.	比如，日本大激进货币宽松政策是首相安倍晋三带领日本经济走出十多年衰退的经济战略的关键要素，并且已经带来了颇为可观的复苏。
The problem is that the policy has also caused the yen to depreciate, leading nearby countries to accuse Japan of adopting “beggar-thy-neighbor” policies.	问题在于该政策还造成了日元贬值，让周边国家指责日本“以邻为壑 ” 。
Similarly, emerging-market officials warned that monetary expansion in the US and the UK would trigger a wave of competitive currency devaluations, with Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega going so far as to accuse the Fed and the Bank of England of waging a full-blown “currency war.”	类似地，新兴市场官员警告美国和英国的货币扩张会触发竞争性贬值，巴西财政部长曼特加（Guido Mantega）更是指责美联储和英格兰银行发动了全面的“货币战争 ” 。
But, while it is true that such expansionary policies can have a recessionary impact on other economies, modern international-finance theory shows that the concept of a “currency war” is a myth.	但是，尽管这些扩张政策确实可能给其他经济体带来衰退性影响，但现代国际金融理论表明“货币战争”的概念纯属神话。
The reality is that, under a flexible exchange-rate regime, competitive devaluations do not produce undesirable imbalances.	现实是，在浮动汇率机制下，竞争性贬值不会导致不利的失衡。
On the contrary, they can bolster recovery in participating economies.	相反，竞争性贬值可以给实施这一战略的国家带来更强劲的复苏。
In fact, currency devaluations were critical to ending the Great Depression.	事实上，货币贬值是大萧条结束的关键。
As Barry Eichengreen and Jeffrey Sachs demonstrated in 1984, while abandoning the gold standard had an immediate negative impact, it quickly spurred recovery, with the first countries to devalue their currencies escaping depression earlier than others.	艾肯格林（Barry Eichengreen）和萨克斯（Jeffrey Sachs）在1984年指出，尽管放弃金本位立刻带来了消极影响，但它很快就刺激了复苏，首批实施货币贬值的国家比其他国家更早摆脱了大萧条。
The fact is that, with a flexible exchange rate, a country can offset the recessionary impact of a neighboring country’s monetary easing using its own independent monetary policy, guided by carefully chosen inflation targets.	事实上，在浮动汇率下，一国可以使用以精心选择的通胀目标为指导独立的货币政策抵消邻国货币扩张的衰退影响。
If all countries adopt this approach, the entire global economy benefits.	如果所有国家都采取这一方针，整体全球经济将因此受益。
By working to revive the domestic economy, the Fed, like other advanced-country central banks, is simply fulfilling its mandate.	美联储和其他发达国家央行一样，它们只是为了重振国内经济而行使了自己的使命。
Instead of complaining about its actions, emerging-country policymakers should be devising strategies for offsetting the spillover effects on their own economies.	新兴国家决策者不应该抱怨这样的行动，而是应该改设计抵消各自受到的溢出效应的战略。
After all, they have the tools to do so.	毕竟，它们手里握着这样做的工具。
	
Japan’s Tax-Hike Test	日本的增税考验
TOKYO – As October began, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced that his government would raise the country’s consumption-tax rate from 5% to 8% next April, and presumably to 10% 18 months after that.	东京—10月伊始，日本首相安倍晋三宣布其政府将从明年4月开始把日本消费税率从5%提高到8 % ， 并在此基础上的18个月后提高到10 % 。
The contrast with what is now happening in the United States could not be sharper.	与之最鲜明的对比莫过于眼下在美国发生的事情。
As US President Barack Obama’s domestic opponents resist his signature health-care legislation, owing to the wealth transfers that it implies, Japanese bureaucrats are trying to recover the authority to administer tax revenue to support social-welfare programs.	美国总统奥巴马的国内反对者因为潜在的财富转移效应而抵制他签署卫生立法；而日本官僚正在试图重振税收收入管理大权以支持社会福利计划。
There are many arguments for raising Japan’s consumption-tax rate.	提高日本消费税率的理由很多。
Japan’s government has a huge debt burden, and its consumption-tax rate is far lower than the value-added-tax rates that prevail in Europe.	日本政府背着巨大的债务负担，其消费税率显著低于欧洲增值税率的普遍水平。
At the same time, the effective corporate-tax rate in Japan is higher than it is elsewhere, making it difficult for Japan to attract investment, foreign or domestic.	与此同时，日本的有效公司税率高于其他国家，这导致日本难以吸引国内外投资。
In order to survive international tax competition – and thus be able to rely on corporate taxes as a source of revenue – Japan’s corporate-tax rate should be lowered in the long run.	为了重振国际税收竞争力 — — 从而能够依赖公司税作为收入源 — — 从长期看日本的公司税率应该降低。
Nonetheless, with Japan’s economy just beginning to recover from more than 15 years of stagnation, such a steep consumption-tax hike is not advisable.	尽管如此，日本经济才刚刚从15年多的停滞中复苏，如此剧烈的消费税提高并不可取。
In fact, such a large increase has seldom – if ever – been attempted, owing to the risk that it would spur consumers to spend before it takes effect, thereby reducing future consumption.	事实上，如此大幅度的增税很少（如果有的话）实施，因为这可能刺激消费者在新税制实施之前抢先消费，从而降低未来消费。
Moreover, any sudden rise in the tax burden results in deadweight losses.	此外，任何突然的税收负担都会导致沉重的损失。
A consumption-tax hike should be timed in such a way that it does not suffocate the economic recovery that Abe’s bold economic program, dubbed “Abenomics,” is facilitating.	消费税提高的时机应该这样选择：它不会阻碍被称为“安倍经济学”的激进经济政策所推动的经济复苏。
Western economists typically favor gradual tax increases; Jeffrey Frankel, for example, recommends a pre-announced plan to increase the tax rate by, say, one percentage point annually for five years.	西方经济学家通常赞成逐渐增加税负，比如，杰弗里·弗兰克尔（Jeffrey Frankel）建议预先公布计划，以（比如）为期五年、每年一个百分点的节奏提高税率。
But Japanese policymakers, media, and academics largely continue to favor a sudden and substantial hike.	但日本决策者、媒体和学界大多仍支持突然大幅增税。
Last year, when Japan’s Diet passed the legislation to raise the consumption tax, it included a provision calling for the plan to be reevaluated if economic conditions required it.	去年，日本国会通过提高消费税的法律时纳入了一项条款，如果经济条件需要可以要求重新评估增税计划。
When the Cabinet Office called upon 60 business leaders, academics, and economists (including me) to perform such an evaluation, more than 70% favored the hike.	内阁询问了60位商界领袖、学者和经济学家（包括我）来做这项评估，70%以上赞同增税。
But the selection of experts reflected a clear bias toward the finance ministry’s views.	但专家的选择显然有利于财务省的观点。
In fact, the ministry has used its “informational campaign” to shape public discussion, convincing scholars, business economists, and the general public to be more concerned about keeping the budget deficit under control than about the effects of a negative demand shock.	事实上，财务省用其“消息活动”左右公共讨，让学者、商业经济学家和公众更关注保持预算赤字可控，更少关注增税对需求的消极冲击。
This is a typical example of what economists like Joseph Stiglitz call “cognitive capture.”	这是约瑟夫·斯蒂格利茨（Joseph Stiglitz）等经济学家所谓的“认知俘虏 ” （ cognitive capture）的典型例子。
For more than two decades – a period characterized by chronic recession and deflation – Japan has retained its position as the world’s richest country in terms of net wealth abroad.	二十多年来 — — 这段时期的特征是长期的衰退和通缩 — — 日本的海外净财富一直是世界之最。
At the end of last year, Japan’s net international wealth amounted to ¥296 trillion ($3 trillion).	到去年年底，日本净国际财富为296万亿日元（3万亿美元 ） 。
But Japan’s government is believed to be the world’s poorest, with the finance ministry reporting that the gross debt/GDP ratio exceeds 200%.	但日本政府被认为是全世界最穷的政府，财务省报告期总债务/GDP比率超过200 % 。
That is an exaggeration.	这有夸张之嫌。
For example, Ichizo Miyamoto, a former senior finance-ministry official, claims that, accounting for the government’s assets, Japan’s net debt/GDP ratio is below 100%, similar to that of the United States.	比如，前财务省高级官员宫本一三（Ichizo Miyamoto）表示，计入政府资产，日本的净债务/GDP比率不到100 % ， 与美国相当。
The validity of the finance ministry’s position on the tax increase was called into question by the decline in Japan’s Nikkei index of stock futures after Abe’s October 1 announcement.	日经指数期货在10月1日安倍晋三宣布计划后下跌，这表明财务省在增税问题立场的正确性可疑。
To be sure, the budget crisis in the US caused most stock futures to decline on that day.	平心而论，美国的预算危机导致了当天大部分股票期货下跌。
But, if the ministry’s view of the consumption tax was correct, Nikkei futures would have gained more – or at least lost less – than futures in other countries.	但是，如果财务省关于消费税的观点正确，则日经期货应该比其他国家的期货涨得更多（活跌得更少 ） 。
Instead, the index declined three times more steeply than others.	相反，日经指数期货跌幅比其他国家深三倍。
And yet, while the consumption-tax increase is not ideally timed, I am not entirely pessimistic about its impact.	而尽管消费税提高的时机并不理想，我倒并不对其影响完全悲观。
The Mundell-Fleming framework – which describes the short-run relationship between the nominal exchange rate, interest rates, and output in an open economy – indicates that, under Japan’s flexible exchange-rate regime, the post-hike decline in demand could be addressed relatively easily with more expansionary monetary policy.	蒙代尔-弗莱明（Mundell-Fleming）框架 — — 描述了开放经济名义汇率、利率和产出之间的短期关系 — — 表明，在日本的弹性汇率机制下，增税后的需求下降可以通过更扩张的货币政策相对容易地得到��正。
That is why Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda should respond accordingly if the tax increase has a deflationary impact.	正因如此，如果增税导致通缩效应，日本银行行长黑田东彦应该采取相应的行动。
In doing so, he would avoid the criticism that former Bank of England Governor Mervyn King faced for supporting a consumer-tax hike in 2011 but failing to use monetary policy to offset its recessionary effects.	如此，他可以避免前英格兰银行行长默文·金（Mervyn King）所面临的的批评 — — 支持2011年消费税增加但没有用货币政策抵消其衰退效应。
Just a year ago, former Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda attempted, despite a deep recession, to raise the consumption tax without monetary easing – a strategy that could have brought only continued economic stagnation.	仅仅在一年前，前首相野田佳彦试图在深度衰退的情况下提高消费税而不放松货币 — — 这一做法的唯一效果是延长经济停滞。
Abe must not make the same mistake.	安倍晋三必须避免同样的错误。
If Japan’s government can overcome a demand setback after the tax increase takes effect – leaving the economy functioning smoothly and initiating a recovery in government revenue – Abe will be able to declare Abenomics an unequivocal success.	如果日本政府可以克服增税实施后出现的需求不振 — — 让经济平稳运行并让政府收入复苏 — — 那么安倍晋三可以宣布安倍经济学取得了不可否认的成功。
	
Abe’s Bullseye	安倍的靶心
TOKYO – Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has unveiled his long-awaited growth strategy – the so-called “third arrow” of what has come to be known as “Abenomics.”	东京—日本首相安倍晋三已经启动了人们其单一就的增长战略，亦即被称为“安倍经济学”的所谓“第三支箭 ” 。
A preliminary version of the plan, announced to Japan’s Diet last year, was met with disappointment in international financial markets, which had expected a bolder approach.	去年，日本议会已经提出了这一计划的预览版，但国际金融市场对此表示失望，没有满足它们更大的预期。
The new version is far more robust – and has received a far more positive global response.	新版本比预览版强劲得多 — — 全球反响也积极得多。
Over the last 18 months, the first and second arrows of Abenomics – consisting of expansionary monetary and fiscal policies – have achieved considerable success in spurring Japan’s economic renewal.	在过去18个月中，安倍经济学的第一支和第二支箭 — — 扩张性货币和财政政策组合 — — 在刺激日本经济复兴方面取得了巨大的成功。
For starters, they have fueled price growth, with the GDP price deflator declining from 3% to nearly zero.	首先，它们推高了物价，GDP价格平减指数从3%下降到接近于零。
Moreover, the ratio of job openings to applicants, which fell to 0.4 under Japan’s last government, led by the Democratic Party of Japan, is now approaching 1.1.	此外，开放申请就业岗位比例曾经在上届民主党政府执政时期下降到0.4，如今已接近1.1。
Indeed, Japan is beginning to show signs of a labor shortage.	事实上，日本一开始呈现出劳动力短缺之势。
But the limits of Abenomics’ first two arrows will soon be reached.	但安倍经济学的前两支箭很快就将形成强弩之末之势。
With employment rising as Japan’s economy moves toward realizing potential output, monetary stimulus will create inflationary pressures and public expenditure will yield sharply diminishing returns.	随着日本经济回归潜在产出，就业也在增长，与此同时，货币刺激将形成通胀压力，公共支出回报将急剧下降。
At that point, significant growth can be achieved only by increasing the economy’s real productive capacity. That is what Abe’s new growth strategy aims to achieve.	到那时，只有通过增加经济的实际生产力才能实现漂亮的增长。
At the strategy’s core is the removal of obstacles to growth for businesses, particularly the elimination or easing of regulatory barriers.	安倍战略的核心是消除企业成长的壁垒，特别是取消或放松监管壁垒。
Deregulation promises to bolster the ability of Japan’s private sector, which already excels in high-technology industries, to innovate and compete globally.	去监管化有望提振日本私人部门的创新和全球竞争实力（目前日本企业在高科技产业已经具备出色表现 ） 。
While some officials, who may benefit from business regulations, may resist this initiative, its economic benefits, together with Abe’s determination, are compelling.	尽管一些从商业监管中获益的官员可能会抵制这一政策，但经济方面的裨益加上安倍的决心使得这一政策已势不可挡。
At the same time, Japan will undergo sweeping labor-market reforms, open designated industries to foreign workers, and create “special economic zones” within which officials will have the authority that they need to reduce red tape in areas like agricultural land management.	与此同时，日本将有全面的劳动力市场改革，向外国工人开放指定行业，并成立“特别经济区 ” 。 在特别经济区中，官员将获得减少农地管理等领域的繁文缛节的权力。
If concluded, the Trans-Pacific Partnership – a mega-regional 12-country free-trade agreement – will provide an additional boost to Japan’s economy.	而如果有12个国家参与的大型自由贸易协定 — — 跨太平洋合作伙伴（Trans-Pacific Partnership）获得通过，将给日本经济带来额外的提振。
Perhaps the most promising reform is corporate-tax reduction, which will help Japan boost both foreign and domestic investment.	也许意义最大的改革是公司税的降低，这有助于日本提振外国和国内投资。
By spurring increased business activity, it will actually increase Japan’s corporate-tax revenue.	事实上，通过刺激商业活动，这能够增加日本的公司税收入。
By global standards, Japan’s current corporate-tax rate of 35% is quite high.	用全球标准衡量，日本当前35%的公司税率非常高。
Indeed, while it remains lower than in some US states (California’s rate, for example, stands at 40%), it exceeds the rates applied in Germany (25%), China (24%), South Korea (24%), the United Kingdom (24%), and Singapore (17%).	事实上，尽管比一些美国州低（如加州的公司税率高达40 % ） ，但日本公司税率高于德国（25 % ） 、中国（24 % ） 、韩国（24 % ） 、英国（24 % ） 和新加坡（17 % ） 。
A quarter-century ago, the UK and Germany had higher corporate-tax rates than Japan.	四分之一世纪前，英国和德国的公司税都高于日本。
But they have since recognized the value of reduced rates.	但此后它们认识到了降低税率的价值。
The UK practically waged a tax war against other countries to attract investment.	英国事实上掀起了一场吸引投资的税收战争。
Both countries’ experiences have demonstrated that substantial reductions over a short period are far more effective than a gradual, drawn-out process.	两国经验表明短期大幅降低税率远比长期缓慢下调更为有效。
Fortunately, Abe plans to follow suit.	幸运的是，安倍准备效仿英德先例。
The impact of this approach may be even more pronounced in Japan, where only a small share of firms currently pay corporate tax.	这一方针的影响在日本可能更为显著，因为目前只有一小部分企业缴纳公司税。
One reason for this is the contractionary monetary policy pursued by former Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa, which prevented the economy from reaching its growth potential for more than 15 years, until Haruhiko Kuroda took over the position.	一个原因是前任日本银行行长白川方明（Masaaki Shirakawa）所实施的紧缩货币政策导致日本经济在15年的时间里都没能实现其增长潜力，直到黑田东彦（Haruhiko Kuroda）上任才有所改观。
Japan’s so-called “special measures for corporate tax” – ad hoc provisions that reduce or waive certain taxes for firms at particular times – have also contributed to sustaining the economy’s output gap.	日本的所谓“公司税特别措施 ” — —即在特殊时期降低或免除某些税收的特别条款 — — 也是日本经济出现产出缺口的原因之一。
These measures not only distort resource allocation; they also often lead to collusion between businesses and government officials seeking opportunities to enter the private sector upon retirement.	这些措施不但扭曲了资源配置；还往往导致企业与寻求在退休后进入私人部门的政府官员的冲突。
Eliminating them would go a long way toward increasing corporate-tax revenue, without stifling growth.	取消这些措施极有利于增加公司税收入，并且不会拖累增长。
Abe’s growth strategy has the potential to bring massive benefits to Japan.	安倍的增长战略有可能给日本带来巨大的好处。
But it will also demand sacrifices.	但也需要做出牺牲。
Consumption-tax hikes will be borne by consumers; the TPP will create new challenges for farmers; and deregulation will run counter to some bureaucrats’ interests.	消费税提高的负担将由消费者承担；跨太平洋合作伙伴将给农民带来新挑战；去监管化不利于某些官僚的利益。
In this context, it is reasonable to expect businesses to relinquish some of their tax exemptions.	在这样的环境下，让企业放弃一些免税优惠也是合理的。
The Abe government has presented a set of forward-looking reforms – and appears determined to follow through on implementing them, even if doing so means confronting those with a vested interest in their failure.	安倍政府提出了一系列前瞻性改革 — — 并表现出不惜对抗既得利益坚定实施改革的决心。
If the third arrow succeeds in sustaining Japan’s economic revival, there will no longer be any room to doubt the merits of Abenomics.	如果第三支箭成功维持了日本经济的复苏，那么安倍经济学的是非也就再无争议之处了。
	
Is Abenomics Working?	安倍经济学有作用吗？
TOKYO – Last April, Japan’s government implemented a long-planned consumption-tax hike, from 5% to 8%, the first in a two-step increase that is expected to bring the rate to 10% by 2015.	东京—去年4月，日本政府实施了计划已久政策，将消费税从5%提高到8 % ， 这是到2015年将该税率提高到10%的两步计划的第一步。
The hike – a key feature of “Abenomics,” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s three-pronged strategy to revive Japan’s economy – signals the government’s long-term commitment to fiscal consolidation.	此次增税是首相安倍晋三为重振日本经济而提出的三管齐下战略 — — “安倍经济学”的关键部分，表明了政府对财政整合的长期承诺。
But it has also dealt Japan a heavy macroeconomic blow.	但它也给日本宏观经济带来了重创。
Preliminary GDP data show a 6.8% contraction year-on-year in the second quarter of this year – the largest since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the country.	初步GDP数据显示，今年二季度日本经济同比收缩6.8 % — —为2011年地震和海啸摧毁日本以来的最大降幅。
Moreover, consumer spending fell by a record amount, contributing to a total real (inflation-adjusted) decline of 5.9% from last July.	此外，消费支出下降创出了历史记录，导致去年7月以来实际（经通胀调整）下降5.9 % 。
But it is not all bad news.	但这并不是坏消息的全部。
Expansionary monetary policy – the second of three so-called “arrows” of Abenomics, after fiscal stimulus – has brought down the unemployment rate to just 3.8%.	扩张性货币政策 — — 安倍经济学所谓三支“箭”中次于财政刺激的第二支 — — 令失业率只有3.8 % 。
The ratio of job openings to applicants has exceeded parity, and the GDP deflator narrowed to close to zero.	可申请岗位数/申请人数比超过1:1，而GDP 平减指数也收窄到接近于零。
Such data have given rise to two opposing views.	如此数据导致了相反的两种观点。
Some economists worry that negative second-quarter data will dampen inflation expectations, thereby undermining Abe’s plan for boosting growth.	有些经济学家担心第二季度的不利数据将抑制通胀预期，从而不利于安倍的提振增长计划。
Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is emphasizing the positive outcomes of its monetary policy – and is hesitating to continue its expansionary measures.	与此同时，日本银行强调其货币政策的积极结果 — — 在犹豫是否继续扩张性措施。
If the first view proves correct, the BOJ will need to ease monetary policy further to counter falling inflation.	如果第一种观点正确，那么日本银行需要进一步放松货币政策以对抗通胀下降。
If the BOJ is right, it should maintain its current approach, while the government should either postpone the next consumption-tax increase or implement it in two 1% increments, instead of a single 2% hike.	如果日本银行正确，那么它应该维持现有方针，同时政府应该中止下一步消费税提高或将其分解为两次1%的提升而不是一次性提高2 % 。
Of course, the second-quarter GDP data show the economy’s immediate response to the hike.	当然，二季度GDP数据表明了经济对消费税提高的最初反应。
But no decision should be made until the third-quarter results are released, providing a clearer picture of what will happen to Japan’s economy after it absorbs the first rate increase.	但在三季度结果发布、搞清楚日本经济在承受了消费税率第一次调高后发生了什么之前，不应该做出任何决定。
Fortunately, that is precisely what Abe intends to do.	幸运的是，安倍正打算这样做。
In any case, the success of monetary policy is difficult to deny.	无论如何，你很难否认货币政策的成功。
As the deflation gap narrows, however, the overall impact of monetary policy will weaken, as it increasingly influences prices more than output.	但是，随着通缩缺口的收窄货币政策的总体影响会下降，因为其对价格而非产出的影响更大。
That is why it is time for Japan’s leaders to shift their focus from the demand-focused first and second arrows to the supply-oriented third arrow: a new growth strategy.	因此，日本领导人应该将注意力从聚焦于需求的第一和第二支箭转向供给导向的第三支箭：新的增长战略。
When there is sufficient excess supply in the economy, promoting supply-side productivity is practically useless without efforts to boost demand.	当经济出现充分多的过度供给时，如果不进行需求刺激，改进供给端生产率是无济于事的。
That implies that it was not appropriate to focus on growth until the deflation gap narrowed considerably – that is, until now.	这意味着，直到通缩缺口大幅收窄后 — — 也就是说，从现在开始 — — 将注意力集中于增长才是合适的。
The third arrow is not a traditional industrial-policy-based approach.	第三支箭不是传统的基于产业政策的方针。
On the contrary, it emphasizes reform of the labor market, deregulation, and a reduction in the corporate-tax rate.	相反，它强调劳动力市场改革、去监管和降低公司税。
A key component of Abe’s growth strategy is to expand the workforce – a major challenge, given that Japanese society is aging rapidly.	安倍增长战略的一个关键部分是扩大劳动力 — — 这是一个大挑战，因为日本社会正在迅速老龄化。
One logical solution would be to integrate more foreign labor into the Japanese economy.	一个自然而然的解决办法是让跟多的外国劳动力融入日本经济。
But efforts to promote immigration face considerable social and cultural barriers.	但促进移民的政策面临着巨大的社会和文化障碍。
A simpler solution would be to mobilize working-age women who already – or plan to – stay at home.	更简单的解决方案是动员居家（或计划居家）的工作年龄女性。
By removing the barriers to employment that women face – whether practical obstacles, like insufficient childcare services, or social constraints – Japan could substantially increase women’s workforce-participation rate, creating an invaluable buffer against the growing labor shortage.	通过打消女性所面临的的就业壁垒 — — 不管是实际障碍（如育儿服务不足）还是社会约束 — — 日本能够极大地提高女性劳动力参与率，为日益短缺的劳动力建立重要缓冲。
The second imperative for boosting growth is the removal of excessively cumbersome government regulations.	提振增长的第二个当务之急是取消过于繁琐的政府监管。
Under the current system, it took 34 years to approve the establishment of a new medical school – the result of collusion between government officials and doctors.	在当前制度下，成立新医学院需要花34年的批准流程 — — 这是政府官员和医生对着干带来的后果。
Abe’s plan calls for introducing a series of less strictly regulated special economic zones, each with a specific objective – for example, adopting new medical technologies or attracting foreign businesses.	安倍的计划要求建立一系列监管较松的特别经济区，各特别经济区都有各自的目标 — — 如采用新医学技术或吸引外国企业。
Such a move promises to help prevent damaging obstructionism by the authorities.	这样做能有助于预防有关部门的从中作梗。
At the same time, the government should work with the country’s trade unions to boost the flexibility and efficiency of the labor market.	预提同时，政府应该与日本工会合作提高劳动力市场的灵活性和效率。
Finally, Abe’s growth strategy demands a corporate-tax reduction – a powerful tool for increasing the tax base in a world in which countries are competing to attract multinational companies.	最后，安倍的增长战略需要降低公司税 — — 在各国竞相吸引跨国公司的背景下，这是扩大税基的有力武器。
Indeed, lower taxes are vital to increase foreign and domestic investment in Japan.	事实上，降低税收对于日本吸引外国和国内投资来说至关重要。
Some of these initiatives, particularly deregulation, will undoubtedly face resistance from bureaucrats concerned about losing their influence.	一些政策，特别是去监管，毫无疑问将面临担心失去影响力的官僚的抵制。
But, as long as Abe, backed by Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, remains committed to his stated objectives, Japan’s economic future will remain bright.	但是，只要获得内阁官房长官菅义伟支持的安倍能够继续着力于他所提出的目标，日本经济的未来仍然是光明的。
	
The Ukrainian Revolution’s Jewish Question	乌克兰革命的犹太问题
WARSAW – “And from a Jewish perspective?”	华沙 — “ 那么从犹太角度呢 ？ ”
I asked Josef Zissels.	我问约瑟夫•吉赛尔斯（Josef Zissels ） 。
The veteran Ukrainian dissident, Jewish activist, and passionate advocate of Ukraine’s “Maidan” movement, had just finished briefing a Warsaw audience about the movement’s spectacular victory and President Viktor Yanukovych’s fall from power.	这位乌克兰老牌持异见者、犹太活动家、乌克兰“迈丹 ” （ Maidan）运动的强烈支持者刚刚向华沙群众传递了运动大获全胜、总统给亚努科维奇被推翻的消息。
“There is no Jewish perspective,” he answered. “There are Jews on both sides of the divide.”	“没有犹太角度 ， ” 他回答说 ， “ 分裂两边都有犹太人 。 ”
That is certainly true.	这太对了。
For example, Aleksander Feldman, the chairman of the Jewish Fund for Ukraine, is a prominent parliamentarian for Yanukovych’s Party of Regions – though he condemned the deposed president after his fall.	比如，乌克兰犹太人基金会（Jewish Fund for Ukraine）主席亚历山大•费尔德曼（Aleksander Feldman）就是著名的支持亚努科维奇的地区党（Party of Regions）的国会议员 — — 尽管他在亚努科维奇被推翻后也开始谴责他。
And several Jewish oligarchs were close to Yanukovych until the very end.	另有一些犹太寡头政治家在亚努科维奇倒台前一直和他走得很近。
But support by Jews for the Maidan movement was much more salient.	但犹太人对迈丹运动的支持更加突出。
Four of the 82 protesters killed in Kyiv’s Independence Square were Jewish, and a Jewish sotnia, or “hundred” – a term, ironically, associated with Cossack pogromists – defended the square against Yanukovych’s uniformed goons.	基辅独立广场上被杀的82名反对者中有四人是犹太人，另有一个犹太“索特尼亚 ” （ sotnia，即“百人队 ” ， 这个词十分讽刺地来自哥萨克大屠杀）在广场上抵抗亚努科维奇爪牙的进攻。
And yet, alongside Jews at the Maidan were Ukrainian nationalists, with their long history of anti-Semitism.	但是，在迈丹运动中与犹太人并肩作战的乌克兰民族主义者有着长期的反犹太史。
That history is important, not only because it justifies treating them with suspicion.	这段历史很重要，不仅是因为这是带着狐疑眼光对待他们的原因。
More important, it animates Russian President Vladimir Putin’s repeated denunciations of “neo-Nazis, Russophobes, and anti-Semites” allegedly running rampant in the streets of Kyiv, forcing a reluctant Russia to protect Jews, Russians, and any decent Ukrainians who remain.	更重要的是，这支持了俄罗斯普京一再重复的所谓“新纳粹、仇俄分子和反犹主义”在基辅街头肆虐、迫使不情愿的俄罗斯保护犹太人、俄罗斯人和所有留在那里的正派乌克兰人。
What are we to make of such claims?	我们对此能说些什么呢？
In recent weeks, violence targeting Jews has indeed occurred, including the stabbing of a rabbi in Kyiv and the firebombing of a synagogue in Zaporizhia.	近几周来，以犹太人为目标的暴力确实发生了，比如一位基辅拉比被刺身亡，扎波罗杰（Zaporizhia）的一间犹太教堂也遭到了燃烧弹的袭击。
But it is impossible to ascertain the perpetrators, and the Maidan nationalists – the Svoboda party, which has five members in the new government and idolizes wartime leader Stepan Bandera, and the even more extreme Right Sector – have taken pains to stress that anti-Semitism is not part of their program today.	但行凶者已无法查明，而迈丹民主主义者 — — 斯沃博达党（Svoboda，该党有五人进入了新政府，并以战时领袖班代拉（Stepan Bandera）为偶像）甚至更极端的右派党（Right Sector ） — —大力强调反犹主义不是他们现今的打算。
Such disavowals should not be discounted as mere window dressing.	这些否定犹太人的行为不能只视为摆姿态。
After all, one dresses windows with what one knows the customer wants to see.	毕竟，摆姿态也要摆出你认为别人想看的姿态。
And the customer of the Maidan is the Ukrainian people, not The New York Times.	而这个“别人”是迈丹运动者，而不是《纽约时报 》 。
If nationalists believe that they will not curry favor with Ukrainians by Jew-baiting, that is a welcome development.	如果民族主义者认为他们不会用激怒犹太人来讨好乌克兰人，那么这是值得欢迎的趋势。
Still, though Ukraine’s chief rabbis and Jewish leaders have emphatically rejected Putin’s claims of anti-Semitic excesses, there is enough hatred and blood in Ukraine’s recent history to make one worry.	但是，尽管乌克兰大拉比和犹太领袖强烈反对普京关于反犹太过度的主张，但在乌克兰现代史上充满了令人担忧的憎恨和流血。
Anti-Semitism was an integral part of European twentieth-century nationalisms, and Bandera’s Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists was no exception.	反犹主义是欧洲二十世纪民族主义的一部分，班代拉的乌克兰民族主义组织（Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists，OUN）也不例外。
The OUN conducted terrorist attacks in pre-war Poland, was persecuted by the Soviets after they occupied Eastern Poland in 1939, allied itself with the Nazis after they invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, and slaughtered thousands of Poles and Jews in a drive to “purify” Ukraine.	OUN在战前的波兰就组织过恐怖袭击，1939年占领东波兰后遭到苏联人迫害，1941年纳粹德国入侵苏联后，OUN与纳粹勾结，以“净化”乌克兰为名屠杀了数千波兰人和犹太人。
But Bandera’s men were nationalists with no allies.	但班代拉的人是没有盟友的民族主义者。
The OUN broke with the Nazis after they denied Ukraine independence, and finally fought the Soviets and both the army of Communist Poland and the anticommunist Polish underground after the Germans were routed.	OUN在纳粹拒绝乌克兰独立后便与之决裂，最终与苏联人以及德国人被赶走后的波兰共产主义和反共产主义地下运动武装都有斗争。
In western Ukraine, they remain the incarnation of a heroic myth.	在西乌克兰，他们仍是英雄史诗的化身。
In eastern Ukraine, with its large Russian population, they are widely seen as traitors to the Soviet motherland.	在俄罗斯族人口甚众的东乌克兰，他们大多被视为苏联祖国的叛徒。
So it is no surprise that Putin is trying to place the Maidan movement beyond the pale by emphasizing the OUN’s passing, if bloody, alliance with the Nazis.	因此，普金试图将迈丹运动扩大化，强调OUN与纳粹的（血腥）结盟史并不令人奇怪。
But the “Great Russia” nationalism that he has stirred up to mobilize popular support for his Ukraine policy is hardly more appealing.	但他所鼓吹用于动员群众支持其乌克兰政策的“大俄罗斯”民族主义也并不更加诱人。
It is true that 70 years ago Russian nationalism served Stalin’s totalitarianism in the righteous cause of defeating Hitler’s totalitarianism.	70年前俄罗斯民族主义支持斯大林集权主义抵抗希特勒集权主义的正义行动，这是事实。
It is also true that Russia today is as free of overt manifestations of anti-Semitism as Ukraine is, largely because Putin’s hostility to Jew-baiting is well known and duly noted.	今天的俄罗斯语乌克兰一样公然表现出反犹主义，这也是事实，因为普京对讨好犹太人十分反感，这是众所周知的。
But Putin’s implied argument that in Ukraine he is refighting WWII, with Russia once again rescuing Jews and the world from nationalist pogromists and their European (read: German/ Nazi) sponsors is simply not credible.	但普京的隐含意思 — — 他正在乌克兰重打二战，俄罗斯将再次拯救犹太人和世界于民族主义迫害者及其欧洲（读作：德国/纳粹）赞助人之手 — — 是决不可信的。
On the contrary, his justification for seizing and occupying Crimea – the need to defend ethnic kin from a nonexistent threat – was precisely Hitler’s justification for annexing the Sudetenland.	相反，他为侵略和占领克里米亚的辩护 — — 为了救民族同胞于子虚乌有的威胁 — — 与希特勒吞并苏台德地区的借口如出一辙。
Observers would do well, therefore, not to dredge up the past while ignoring the present.	因此，观察者应该不拘泥于过去、不忽略现在。
The Maidan movement, for all of the nasty antecedents of some of its participants, began as a true popular uprising against a corrupt and despotic regime supported by an expansionist Russia.	迈丹运动 — — 尽管一些参与者此前有过不良案底 — — 是真正的反对腐败残暴政权的群众起义，其背后有扩张主义俄罗斯的支持。
Illiberal nationalism is one of the movement’s driving elements, owing to its widely shared and understandable anti-Russia appeal.	狭隘民族主义是这场运动背后的推动力之一，因为这场运动有人所共有、亦不难理解的反俄诉求。
And, though that nationalism may yet be directed against Ukraine’s Russians, Poles, and Jews, as it was in the past, the rest of the movement would resist such a turn (which may well explain why it has not happened).	此外，尽管民族主义可能如过去一样被引导为反对乌克兰的俄罗斯人、波兰人和犹太人，但迈丹运动的其他部分将能抵制这一转变（这也很好地解释了为什么没有变成这样 ） 。
Putin’s claim that fascists have taken control in Kyiv is fundamentally bogus, while Russia’s despicable actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine are all too real.	普京的主张 — — 法西斯主义者控制了基辅 — — 是彻头彻尾的谎言，而俄罗斯在克里米亚和东乌克兰的卑劣行动则是铁一样的事实。
Russia does retain some support among Russophone Ukrainians of all ethnicities, including some Jews.	俄罗斯确实拥有来自各民族俄罗斯裔乌克兰人的支持，包括一些犹太人。
But Zissels is right: The battle is not about them; it is about the survival of a fledgling democratic nation-state.	但吉赛尔斯是对的：这场战争和他们无关；这场战争和刚刚起步的民主民族国家的生死存亡有关。
	
Toward a People-Centered ASEAN Community	通往以人民为中心的东盟社会
SEOUL – I am delighted that my first meeting with the leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations comes at a historic moment: the 50th anniversary of ASEAN’s founding.	首尔—很高兴我与东南亚国家联盟领导人的第一次会晤正逢历史时刻：东盟成立50周年。
During those 50 years, not only my country, the Republic of Korea, but almost all of Asia has been utterly transformed.	在这50年里，我的祖国韩国以及几乎整个亚洲都发生了翻天覆地的变化。
ASEAN’s role in harnessing and spreading economic dynamism has been essential to the region’s success.	东盟在促进和传播经济活力方面所起到的作用，对于亚洲地区的成功至关重要。
For Korea, ASEAN has undoubtedly been a special and valued friend.	对韩国来说，东盟是毋庸置疑的宝贵的特殊朋友。
Last year alone, some six million Koreans visited ASEAN member states, both as tourists and for business.	光是在去年，就有约六百万韩国人来到东盟成员国旅行，他们当中既有游客，也有商务人士。
Approximately 500,000 citizens of ASEAN member states now live and work in Korea, while roughly 300,000 Koreans live and work in ASEAN countries.	大约500,000东盟成员国公民现在在韩国生活和工作，大约300,000韩国人在东盟国家生活和工作。
This is one example of why Korea’s ties with ASEAN are more than just intergovernmental relations.	这是韩国与东盟的关系不仅局限于政府间关系的一个例子。
Our relationship is deepened in the most personal way possible, through the intertwining of so many individuals’ lives.	我们的关系因为如此多个体生活之间的牵挂，而通过最为个人化的方式得到了深化。
This fact should not surprise anyone.	这个事实并不足为奇。
ASEAN 2025: Forging Ahead Together, which was endorsed by ASEAN leaders at their 27th Summit in November 2015, states that the group strives to be a “people-centered, people-oriented community” that seeks to build a caring and sharing society which is inclusive and where the well-being, livelihood, and welfare of the people are enhanced.	2015年11月，东盟领导人在第27次东盟峰会上推出了《东盟2025：携手前进 》 （ ASEAN 2025: Forging Ahead Together ） ， 该宣言指出，该集团致力于“以人民为中心、以人民为导向的社会 ” ， 寻求构建一个关怀共享的包容社会，让人民的福祉、生计和福利得到提升。
“People first” has been my longstanding political philosophy as well, and it is a vision in line with the spirit of Korea’s “candlelight revolution” that lit and heated up the winter in Korea a year ago.	“人民优先”也一直是我长期以来的政治哲学，它是一个和一年前照亮和温暖韩国的“烛光革命”精神异曲同工的愿景。
Korea and ASEAN share a common philosophy that values people, and that shared outlook will set the path that Korea and ASEAN take together in the years and decades ahead.	韩国和东盟有着共同的哲学，即注重人民，而这一共同前景将为韩国和东盟铺就未来几十年携手共进的道路。
Since 2010, Korea and ASEAN have made significant strides together as strategic partners.	2010年以来，韩国和东盟作为战略合作伙伴，一起取得了重大进步。
Korea-ASEAN cooperation so far, however, has remained focused mainly on government-led collaboration in political, security, and economic affairs.	但是，目前韩国-东盟合作仍然主要集中在政府领导的政治、安全和经济领域的合作项目。
I intend to help advance Korea-ASEAN relations while placing a high priority on the “people” – both Koreans and the people of ASEAN.	我想在助力韩国-东盟关系的同时，将“人民”列为工作重点 — — 既包括韩国人，也包括东盟人民。
My vision is to create, in cooperation with ASEAN, a “peace-loving, people-centered community where all members are better off together.”	我的愿景，是与东盟一起建立一个“热爱和平、以人民为中心的社会，让所有成员的境况都能得到改善 。 ”
This can be summed up in “three Ps”: People, Prosperity, and Peace.	这可以归结为“3P ” ： 人民（People ） 、 繁荣（Prosperity）和和平（Peace ） 。
To realize this vision, I will pursue “people-centered diplomacy.”	为了实现这一愿景，我将追求“以人民为中心的外交 ” 。
So, from this point onward, cooperation between Korea and ASEAN will be developed in a way that respects public opinion among all of the peoples of our association, gains their support, and invites their hands-on participation.	因此，从这一点出发，韩国与东盟之间的合作将尊重我们中间所有民族的公共观念，赢得他们的支持，邀请他们躬身参与。
To this end, and in commemoration of ASEAN’s 50th anniversary, we have designated this year as “Korea-ASEAN Cultural Exchange Year,” and actively promoted various cultural and people-to-people exchanges.	在这方面，以及为了纪念东盟成立50周年，我们将今年定为“韩国-东盟文化交流年 ” ， 积极地推动不同文化之间和人际之间的交流。
Last September, the ASEAN Culture House (ACH) opened in Korea’s southern port city of Busan.	去年9月，东盟文化学院（ASEAN Culture House，ACH）在韩国南部的港口城市釜山开门。
The ACH is the first of its kind to be opened in an ASEAN dialogue partner country, and it is expected to serve as a hub for cultural and people-to-people exchanges between Korea and ASEAN members.	ACH是东盟对话伙伴国家开设的第一家此类学院，我们希望它成为韩国和东盟成员国之间文化和人际交流的枢纽。
The Korean government will spare no effort to expand these exchanges, especially among the young people who will lead Korea-ASEAN relations in the future.	韩国政府将全力以赴扩大这些交流，特别是在将成为未来韩国-东盟关系领导者的年轻人之间的交流。
We should also work to build a community of peace where people are safe.	我们还应该致力于构建一个人民可以安全地生活在其中的社会。
In Asia, we all are facing the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missiles, as well as non-traditional security threats, including terrorism, violent extremism, and cyber-attacks on our businesses, our social and civic infrastructure, and our official institutions.	在亚洲，我们都面临着朝鲜核武器和导弹所带来的威胁，除此之外还有非传统安全威胁，包括恐怖主义、暴力极端主义以及对我们的企业、我们的社会和民用基础设施，以及我们的官方机构的网络袭击。
The Korean government will strive to ensure that both Koreans and the people of ASEAN are able to lead happy and safe lives, which means cooperating with all ASEAN member states, at both the bilateral and multilateral level, to overcome the security challenges that we jointly face.	韩国政府将致力于确保韩国人和东盟人民能够过上幸福安全的生活，这意味着要与所有东盟成员国进行双边和多边层次的合作，以克服我们共同面对的安全挑战。
Finally, I will endeavor to promote greater mutual prosperity, which benefits citizens of both ASEAN and Korea.	最后，我将竭尽全力促进更大的共同繁荣，让东盟和韩国公民共同受益。
To ensure the sustainability of people-centered cooperation, all countries in the region must grow and develop together.	为了确保以人民为中心的合作的可持续性，所有域内国家必须实现共同增长和发展。
Creating a structure for mutual prosperity requires lowering regional and transnational barriers to facilitate the flow of goods and promote people-to-people interactions.	为构建一个共同繁荣构架需要消除地区和跨国壁垒，以便利商品流动、促进人际交流。
In short, ASEAN’s dynamism must now be tied to its inclusiveness.	简言之，东盟的活力现在已经与其包容性紧密相连。
That is why Korea will actively support the “Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2025” and “Initiative for ASEAN Integration (IAI) Work Plan,” both of which call for enhancing the connectivity between ASEAN economies and citizens.	因此，韩国将积极支持“2025年东盟联动性总体规划 ” （ Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2025）和“东盟一体化（IAI）工作计划方案 ” （ Initiative for ASEAN Integration (IAI) Work Plan ） ， 两者都要求加强东盟经济体和公民之间的联动性。
We will also accelerate the pace of negotiations for the further liberalization of a Korea-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (FTA), in order to pave the way for freer and more inclusive growth in the region.	我们还将加快韩国-东盟自由贸易协定（FTA）进一步自由化的谈判，从而为更自由、更包容的地区增长铺平道路。
Korea is now preparing for yet another “hot” winter: the PyeongChang Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, to be held in February 2018.	目前，韩国正在准备有一个“热”冬天：将在2018年2月举行的平昌冬奥会和冬残奥会。
Our preparations are focused on ensuring that these Games deliver a message of reconciliation, peace, mutual understanding, and cooperation throughout the world.	我们的准备工作的重点是要确保这次冬奥会传递全世界和谐、和平、互相理解以及合作的精神。
I happily invite you all to discover a peaceful and joyous winter in PyeongChang, and experience the dynamism sweeping through Korea and ASEAN.	我愉快地邀请你们所有人来平昌渡过一个和平快乐的冬季，体验韩国和东盟无处不在的活力。
Don’t miss an opportunity to find out and enjoy what Korea and ASEAN share in common.	不要错过发现和享受韩国和东盟共同点的机会。
	
Kosovo’s Original Sin	科索沃的原罪
PRISTINA – Hundreds of people disappeared ten years ago in Kosovo, the former Serbian province that is now the world’s newest state.	普里什蒂纳 — — 10年前有数百人在科索沃失踪，这个曾经的塞尔维亚省已经是全世界最新成立的一个国家。
These are not missing persons like the Albanians whom Serbian police executed and buried in secret graves during the Kosovo conflict of 1999.	这些人不同于1999年科索沃战争期间被塞尔维亚警察枪决后掩埋在秘密坟墓中的阿尔巴尼亚失踪者。

Most were Serb civilians.	其中多数人是塞族平民。
Relatives of most report that they were abducted.	多数失踪者的亲属报告他们被人绑架。
Kosovo, to a significant degree, owes its independence to a NATO military intervention undertaken in the name of human rights.	很大程度上科索沃独立应归功于北约以人道主义为名发起的军事干预行动。
And in the name of human rights, it is time for the truth to come out about the people who went missing after the conflict, and about why, for a decade, UN officials ignored appeals by the victims’ families and launched no criminal investigation.	以人权的名义，现在是时候揭开战后人员失踪真相，以及为什么在10年时间里，联合国官员不理睬受害者家属提出的申诉，没有进行任何刑事调查。
Kosovo’s Albanian authorities have for years made no significant decision without receiving the imprimatur of the European Union and, especially, the United States.	多年以来，科索沃阿尔巴尼亚当局未获欧盟、特别是美国的批准没有做出任何重要的决策。
They should urge the Kosovo government to mount a credible investigation, for the sake of the victims and people in Kosovo who want their state to be ruled by law.	看在受害者和希望实现法治的科索沃民众份上，他们应当敦促科索沃政府进行令人信服的调查。
In 1999, the US led NATO into war against Slobodan Milosevic’s Serbia to end gross violations of the rights of Kosovo’s majority Albanians.	1999年，以美国为首的北约向斯洛博丹·米洛舍维奇的塞尔维亚宣战，以结束对科索沃多数阿尔巴尼亚人权利的严重侵犯。
Serb nationalists had quashed Kosovo’s autonomy.	塞尔维亚民族主义者不承认科索沃自治。
Serb troops beat, killed, and jailed Albanians, whose leaders, following cues from Western embassies, urged nonviolence.	塞族军队殴打、杀戮和关押阿尔巴尼亚人，而阿族领袖在西方各国使馆的暗示下，敦促非暴力解决争端。
After the rise of an Albanian insurgency, the Kosovo Liberation Army (UCK), Milosevic launched a violent, all-out campaign to expel Kosovo’s Albanians.	在阿尔巴尼亚叛军科索沃解放军（UCK）成立之后，米洛舍维奇发起了一场暴力行动，全力驱赶科索沃的阿尔巴尼亚人。
Villages were burned.	村庄被焚毁。
Serbian police forces killed Albanian civilians and cast out hundreds of thousands.	塞族警察部队杀害阿尔巴尼亚平民，驱逐了数十万人。
(The authorities in Belgrade have yet to come clean on the Albanians civilians executed and buried on police and military bases in Serbia.)	（贝尔格莱德当局至今尚未就塞尔维亚军警基地中处决和掩埋的阿尔巴尼亚平民全盘招供 ） 。
NATO forced Serb forces to withdraw in June 1999, and international peacekeepers, under NATO’s leadership, occupied Kosovo.	北约军队迫使塞族军队于1999年6月撤军，以北约为首的国际维和部队随之占领科索沃。
The UN sent a mission to help establish local institutions.	联合国派遣使团协助重建当地机构。
The US and West European countries began shepherding Kosovo’s new Albanian authorities toward statehood.	美欧国家开始指导科索沃新的阿尔巴尼亚政权建国。
Last year, Kosovo gained independence.	去年，科索沃宣布独立。
Sixty countries, including the US and most EU states, have recognized it.	包括美国和欧盟国家在内的60个国家承认科索沃建国。
According to a recent BBC news investigation, however, UCK members abducted Serbs, Albanians, Roma, and others after NATO’s arrival.	但据不久前BBC新闻调查报道，科索沃解放军在北约进驻后绑架塞族、阿族、罗马族和其他民族群众。
UN missing-persons researchers – not criminal investigators – searched for them for years and found no trace of them in Kosovo.	联合国失踪研究员（而非刑事调查员）调查了几年时间，在科索沃没有找到任何线索。
They did, however, find Albanian witnesses who asserted that UCK members took captured Serbs, Albanians, and Roma into Albania, where they were killed.	但他们确实发现了阿族目击者指称科索沃解放军将被俘的塞尔维亚人、阿尔巴尼亚人和罗马人带到阿尔巴尼亚，并在阿境内将他们杀害。
Now the BBC has broadcast interviews with Albanians who were imprisoned in secret UCK camps in Albania.	BBC播出了对关押在科索沃解放军阿尔巴尼亚秘密集中营的阿尔巴尼亚人的采访录像。
These witnesses confirmed that the camps also held Serbs, Roma, and others.	这些目击者证实集中营也关押塞族、罗马族和其他民族群众。
The BBC located graves of some of the missing in Albania.	BBC在阿尔巴尼亚找到了一些失踪者的坟墓。
There have been leaks of UN documents citing Albanian sources who name people involved.	传闻一份泄露的联合国文件列出了参与人员名单等情报。
From June 1999, the UN and NATO contingents in Kosovo clearly calculated that stability trumped justice.	从1999年6月开始，科索沃的联合国及北约分遣队明确认为稳定压倒了公正。
Despite the urging of staff members, leaders of these missions avoided launching criminal investigations into the missing.	各分遣队领袖不顾工作人员的一再敦促，拒绝对失踪事件进行刑事调查。
Some UCK leaders, lionized by the local Albanian population as the victors of 1999, are now running Kosovo’s government.	被当地阿尔巴尼亚人视为1999年胜利者而与之结交的某些科索沃解放军领袖现在掌管着科索沃政府。
Their blanket denials are no longer credible.	他们空洞的否认无法再让人信服。
Kosovo will not convince many more countries to recognize its independence unless it investigates these disappearances and demonstrates a commitment to the rule of law.	除非调查失踪事件，显示实现法治的决心，否则科索沃将无法说服更多国家承认它的独立。
(Likewise, no one should forget the Albanian dead that Serbia has not returned.)	（同样，人们也不该忘记塞尔维亚尚未归还的阿尔巴尼亚遇难者。
A credible investigation requires full backing from the authorities in Albania and from the newly established EU mission in Kosovo.	）需要有阿尔巴尼亚当局和新成立的欧盟科索沃行动小组的全力支持才能开战令人信服的调查。
On the record, leaders of this mission say that they are interested in investigating.	在公开场合，行动小组领导人说愿意展开调查。
Diplomats speaking off the record, however, tell a different tale, even as some Albanian political leaders, including some former UCK officials, call for an inquiry.	但就算包括某些前科索沃解放军军官在内的阿尔巴尼亚政治领袖呼吁展开调查行动，私下谈话的外交官态度却截然不同。
The US should use its political clout with Albania and Kosovo to press for a thorough investigation, and for criminal proceedings against anyone who is implicated.	美国应当利用对阿尔巴尼亚和科索沃的政治影响促成全面彻底的调查，并对涉案人员提起刑事起���。
Albanians are outraged at the allegations that UCK members engaged in war crimes and other criminal behavior.	科索沃解放军参与战争和其他刑事犯罪的指控让阿尔巴尼亚人愤怒。

But there are many Albanians who know differently, and believe that Kosovo is failing to come to terms with the acts of a few rogue fighters.	但也有很多阿尔巴尼亚人知道事实真相，相信科索沃由于极少数流氓战士的行为未能实现目标。
These Albanians fear that, in the absence of the rule of law, Kosovo will become a mafia state.	这些阿尔巴尼亚人担心没有了法治，科索沃将成为一个黑手党国家。
Kosovo’s Albanians do not want a state tainted by such allegations.	科索沃的阿尔巴尼亚人要的不是被指控污染的国家。
They want a state that respects human rights for everyone.	他们希望国家尊重每个人的人权。
And they want answers about the fate of hundreds of people who have been missing for a decade.	他们也想找到数百位长达10年的失踪者命运的答案。
	
India’s Deadly Entrance Exams	印度的夺命高考
NEW DELHI – In late April, a 17-year-old girl named Kriti Tripathi leaped to her death in Kota, India, shortly after passing the country’s examination for admission to the prestigious Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT).	新德里—4月底，17岁的女孩克里提·特立帕提（Kriti Tripathi）在印度科塔（Kota）跳楼身亡。
A week later, another Kota student, Preeti Singh, hanged herself, succumbing to her injuries after a few days.	她刚刚通过印度理工 学院（IIT）入学考试。
Singh’s was the ninth suicide by a student in Kota this year alone, and the 56th in the last five.	一周后，另一位科塔学生普利提·辛格（Preeti Singh）自缢，几天后身亡。
All attended Kota’s “coaching institutes,” whose sole purpose is to prepare high-school students for the IIT Joint Entrance Examination (JEE).	她们都参加了科塔“补习班 ” ， 这些补习班的唯一目的是帮助高中生准备IIT入学联考。
In a five-page suicide note, Tripathi expressed her frustration at having been compelled to study engineering, when her real ambition was to become a NASA scientist.	在五页长的遗书中，特立帕提表示对于自己被迫学习工科感到沮丧，她真正的志向是成为一名美国宇航局（NASA）科学家。
She also described the pressure she had faced at the coaching institution.	她还描述了自己在补习班所遇到的压力。
Tripathi implored the Human Resource Development Ministry to shut down such institutes, which force their students to endure unbearable stress and depression.	特立帕提恳请人力资源部关闭这些强迫学生忍受不可承受的压力和抑郁的补习班。
The story is all too common, but should the blame really be laid on the coaching institutes?	她的故事太平常了，但矛头真的应该指向补习班吗？
In fact, Kota’s coaching institutes are a symptom of a larger problem, hinted at by the city’s senior administrator, District Collector Ravi Kumar Surpur, in an emotional letter he wrote in response to the latest deaths.	事实上，科塔的补习班只是一个更大的问题的症候。 该市高级官员、区税务官拉维·库马尔·苏尔珀尔（Ravi Kumar Surpur）在一封回应最近的死亡事件的充满感情色彩的信中提到了这一问题。
Addressing parents directly, Surpur pleaded with them not to subject their children to excessive stress in an attempt to live vicariously through them.	苏尔珀尔将矛头直指家长，恳请他们不要让孩子承受过度压力，替自己完成心愿。
Indian parents are known for demanding academic excellence from their children.	印度家长以对孩子成绩要求严格闻名。
They know that a professional degree in the right field is a passport to social and economic advancement, so they push hard to ensure that their children get one – something that India’s higher-education system does not make easy.	他们知道，在正确专业取得专业学位有助于社会和经济成就，因此他们竭尽全力确保孩子能获得一个这样的学位 — — 而在印度高等教育体系中，获得这一学位绝不容易。
Given this deeply entrenched culture of academic ambition, the planned administrative inquiry into conditions at the Kota coaching institutes is unlikely to result in remedial action.	在这一根深蒂固的成绩文化影响下，计划对科塔补习班环境进行行政调查不可能形成纠正措施。
The toll this culture takes on young people is obvious.	这种文化对年轻人造成的伤害是显而易见的。
Students are forced to pass brutally difficult examinations – only about 10,000 of the 500,000 who take the IIT-JEE each year score high enough to be admitted – in subjects they often detest.	学生们被迫参加难道变态的考试 — — 每年参加IIT联考的人数有500,000，只有大约10,000能上线 — — 而他们往往很讨厌这些考试科目。
And Indian students are far more likely to push themselves until they crack than to drop out.	印度学生常常把自己逼到崩溃也不肯放弃。
Engineering and medicine remain the subjects of choice for middle-class Indian parents.	工科和医科仍是印度中产阶级家长的科目选择。
The country graduates a half-million engineers every year, some 80% of whom end up in jobs that do not require an engineering degree.	每年印度有五十万工程师毕业，其中80%的人从事不需要工科学位的工作。
But, in a throwback to the mid-twentieth century, Indian parents view engineering as the gateway to modernity, and continue pressing their children to study it.	但是，印度家长的观念还停留在二十世纪中叶，认为工科是现代化的敲门砖，继续强迫孩子学工科。
Students who do not make it to an IIT end up in institutions of varying quality, many of which do not equip their graduates for today’s labor market.	考不上ITT最后会进入水平参差不齐的各种院校，其中许多院校的无法让毕业生具备当今劳动力市场所需要的技能。
But at least there are enough engineering colleges in India to meet demand.	但至少印度有足够的工学院满足需求。
Medicine, by contrast, is a frustratingly crowded field – and for no good reason.	相反，医科的拥挤程度令人丧气 — — 并且有些“无厘头 ” 。
India’s medical profession is controlled by the Medical Council of India, an opaque and self-serving cabal that has intentionally limited the supply of available medical college seats.	印度医学界由印度医学委员会把持，这是一个不透明的自利组织，刻意限制医学院学位供给。
Medical colleges must be recognized by the MCI, which has seen fit to permit only 381 to exist.	医学院必须获得印度医学委员会承认，而该委员会只承认381家医学院。
That leaves only 63,800 slots each year in a country of 1.2 billion people – enough space for fewer than 1% of Indian students aspiring to attend medical school.	这意味着12亿印度人每年只有638,000个医学学位 — — 只占想读医科的印度学生的不到1 % 。
As if that were not bad enough, some of the seats are awarded against “donations,” with the wealthy essentially purchasing positions that their marks do not merit.	雪上加霜的是，其中一些学位还要为“捐赠”保留，即有钱人分不够可以花钱上学。
Meanwhile, high-achieving students who just barely missed the cutoff have to find alternatives – or pursue another field altogether.	与此同时，恰好被卡的优秀学生则必须另寻出路 — — 或者换一个专业。
Those whose families can afford it often end up studying medicine abroad.	负担得起的家庭的孩子常常出国去读医科。
Many do not return to India, depriving the country of their much-needed expertise.	许多不再回到印度，导致印度无法获得急需的 医学专家。
Some return after having attended obscure colleges in countries like Georgia or China, only to have the MCI refuse to recognize their degrees and block them from practicing.	一些人在格鲁吉亚或中国的严苛医学院学成归国，学位却得不到医学委员会的承认，无法行医。
For those who cannot afford to go abroad – even bright students who barely missed the cutoff for a spot at an Indian university – studying medicine is no longer an option.	对于无力出国留学的人来说 — — 即使他是非常聪明的学生，只不过恰好考不上某个印度大学 — — 学医医科就此梦断。
Yet India desperately needs doctors.	但印度急需医生。
According to the World Health Organization, the country has just 0.7 doctors per 1,000 people.	据世界卫生组织的数据，印度每1,000人只有0.7名医生。
In the United States and the United Kingdom – two countries to which Indian doctors often emigrate – the rate is 2.5 per 1,000 and 2.8 per 1,000, respectively.	在常常作为印度医生移民目的地的美国和英国，这一比例分别为2.5和2.8。
The crippling lack of capacity means that lives are lost every day – particularly in rural areas – for want of medical attention.	医务人员严重不足意味着每天都会发生因为缺医少药而导致的生命损失 — — 特别是在农村地区。
India could be graduating four or five times as many capable doctors as it does each year.	印度有能力每年培养比现在多三四倍的医学毕业生。
Yet the MCI has been allowed to pursue its restrictive approach, depriving poor Indians of adequate health care, while augmenting the already-huge pressure on students to gain a seat in a medical college.	但印度放任医学委员会严格控制医学生人数，导致印度穷人无法获得充足的医疗服务，同时也进一步增加了压力已然非常巨大的学生考取医学院的压力。
It is in this context – with a huge population competing for a tiny number of seats in professional colleges – that coaching institutes like those in Kota thrive.	正是在这样的背景下 — — 巨大的人口竞争极少数专业学院学位 — — 科塔补习班这样的机构得以兴盛。
When succeeding in tough entrance examinations is the only way to fulfill one’s educational goals, test preparation becomes the be-all and end-all of schooling.	当“千军万马过独木桥”成为实现教育目标的唯一途径时，复习就成为教育的一切和终极目标。
Eager to satisfy pushy parents, young people sacrifice their own interests at the altar of a false god.	为了满足家长的“进取心 ” ， 印度年轻人为了这个伪神坛而牲了自己的兴趣。
The 56 pyres lit in Kota over the last five years are a tragic testament to how damaging this conception of academic excellence can be.	过去五年，科塔有56名学生自杀，这便是应试教育危害的悲剧写照。
	
The Kremlin and the US Election	克里姆林宫与美国大选
CAMBRIDGE – In early November, US President Barack Obama reportedly contacted Russian President Vladimir Putin personally to warn against cyber attacks aimed at the American presidential election.	发自剑桥 — — 据报道，11月初美国总统奥巴马曾亲自致电与俄罗斯总统普京，警告其不要针对美国总统大选发动网络袭击。
The previous month, the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, and Jeh Johnson, the Secretary of Homeland Security, publicly accused Russia’s most senior officials of using cyber attacks to “interfere with the US election process.”	而上个月，美国国家情报局局长詹姆斯·克莱珀（James Clapper）和国土安全部长杰·约翰逊（Jeh Johnson）则公开指责某些俄罗斯最高级别官员利用网络攻击来“干扰美国大选进程 ” 。
In the aftermath of the November 8 election, no firm evidence has emerged that hacking interfered with voting machines or other electoral machinery.	在回顾11月8日大选的过程中，并无确切证据表明黑客曾入侵投票机或其他选举机制。
But in an election that turned on 100,000 votes in three key states, some observers argue that Russian cyber interference in the political process may have had a significant impact.	但是在涉及100万票的三个关键州投票中，一些观察家认为俄罗斯对该政治程序的网络干预可能已经产生了重大影响。
Can such Russian behavior be deterred in the future?	俄罗斯的这种行为在将来能否被遏制？
Deterrence always depends on who and what one is trying to deter.	这取决于由谁出手，以及遏制的对象是什么。
Ironically, deterring states from using force may be easier than deterring them from actions that do not rise to that level.	讽刺的是，阻止各国发动网络行动甚至比阻止它们使用更高级别的武力更困难。
The threat of a surprise attack such as a “cyber Pearl Harbor” has probably been exaggerated.	但遭到“网络珍珠港”这类突袭的威胁或许是被夸大了。
Critical infrastructures such as electricity or communications are vulnerable, but major state actors are likely to be constrained by interdependence.	虽然电力或通信等关键基础设施相对脆弱，但各主要国家都会受到相互依存关系的制肘。
And the United States has made clear that deterrence is not limited to cyber retaliation (though that is possible), but can target other sectors with any tools it chooses, ranging from naming and shaming and economic sanctions to nuclear weapons.	而美国也已明确表示，遏制行动不仅限于网络报复（尽管这是可能的 ） ， 还可能选择任何工具 — — 从公开指责羞辱到经济制裁，再到核武器 — — 来打击其他部门。
The US and others, including Russia, have agreed that the laws of armed conflict apply in cyberspace.	美国以及包括俄罗斯在内的其他国家都已同意将武装冲突的相关法则适用于网络空间。
Whether a cyber operation is treated as an armed attack depends on its consequences, rather than on the instruments used.	一场网络行动是否被视为武装攻击并非取决于使用何种工具，而是其所造成的后果。
It would have to result in destruction of property or injury or death to individuals.	它必须导致财产损失或人员伤亡。
But what about deterring operations that are not equivalent to an armed attack?	但如何阻止那些不等同于武装进攻的行动呢？
There are gray areas in which important targets (say, a free political process) are not strategically vital in the same way as the electrical grid or the financial system.	其中存在一些灰色地带，比如某些目标（例如自由的政治程序）虽然重要，但其战略重要性的表现方式却与电网或金融系统不一样。
Destroying the latter could damage lives and property; interference with the former threatens deeply held political values.	摧毁后者可能会破坏生命财产；对前者的干涉则威胁着深层次的政治价值观。
In 2015, a United Nations Group of Government Experts (including the US, Russia, China, and most states with significant cyber capabilities) agreed to a norm of not targeting civilian facilities in peacetime.	2015年，一个联合国政府专家组（包括美国，俄罗斯，中国和大多数具备强大网络实力的国家）就一个在和平时期不得攻击民用设施的规范上达成了一致。
This agreement was endorsed by the G20 countries at their summit in Turkey in November 2015.	这个协议随后在2015年11月G20土耳其峰会上被签署通过。
When an anonymous cyber attack interfered with the Ukrainian electric grid the following month, some analysts suspected the Russian government of using cyber weapons in its continuing hybrid warfare against Ukraine.	谁知刚过一个月，乌克兰电网就遭到了一个匿名网络攻击，一些分析师怀疑俄罗斯政府针对乌克兰的合成战争中使用了网络武器。
If true, it would mean that Russia had violated the agreement it had just signed.	如果此事属实，就意味着俄罗斯违反了自身刚刚签署的协议。
But how should one interpret Russian behavior in regard to the American election?	但是如何解释俄罗斯在美国大选中的行为呢？
According to US officials, Russian intelligence agencies hacked into the email accounts of important Democratic Party officials and provided the materials to WikiLeaks to dribble out over the course of the campaign, thereby ensuring a continuous steam of news stories that were unfavorable to Hillary Clinton.	据美国官员说，俄罗斯情报机构入侵了民主党官员的电子邮���帐户，并在整个选举进程中持续透露材料给维基解密网站，从而确保不断有关于希拉里的负面新闻曝光。
This alleged Russian disruption of the Democratic presidential campaign fell into a gray area that could be interpreted as a propaganda response to Clinton’s 2010 proclamation of a “freedom agenda” for the Internet or retaliation for what Russian officials saw as her critical comments about Putin’s election in 2012.	这种所谓俄罗斯对民主党总统大选的破坏行动落入一个灰色地带，可以解释为针对希拉里2010年提出的互联网“自由议程”所发动的宣传战，或是俄罗斯官员为她抨击普京2012年竞选总统的言论而做出报复。
Whatever the motive, it looked like an effort to skew the US political process – precisely the type of nonlethal political threat that one would want to deter in the future.	但无论动机为何，这看起来像一种扭曲美国政治进程的行动 — — 也正是在人们未来想要遏制的那种非致命性政治威胁。
The Obama administration had previously made efforts to rank the seriousness of cyber attacks, but without sorting out the ambiguities of these gray areas.	奥巴马政府曾试图于将网络攻击按照其严重性划分等级，但依然未能理清这些这些模糊的灰色地带。
In 2016, Obama faced difficult choices in estimating the escalatory potential of responding with cyber measures or with a cross-sector response such as sanctions.	今年奥巴马有点手足无措，不知道应该更多地考虑利用网络手段，还是采取类似制裁等跨部门应对措施。
The administration did not want to take steps that might themselves disrupt the election.	但政府担心这些措施本身可能就会对选举造成干扰。
So, eight days before the vote, the US sent Russia a warning about election meddling over a hotline – created three years earlier to deal with major cyber incidents – that connects the Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers in both countries.	因此在投票前八天，美国通过三年前建立的一条连接了两国减少核风险中心（Nuclear Risk Reduction Center）的热线 — — 专责处理重大网络事件 — — 向俄罗斯发出了停止干涉选举的警告。
Because Russian hacking activity seemed to slow or halt, the Obama administration cited the warning as a successful exercise in deterrence.	因为俄罗斯黑客活动似乎已经减少或停止，奥巴马政府将该警告视为一次成功的威慑行动。
But some critics say the Russians had already achieved their main goals.	但一些批评者则认为俄罗斯人已经实现了其主要目的。
Three weeks after the election, the administration said that it remained confident in the overall integrity of America’s electoral infrastructure, and that the election was free and fair from a cyber-security perspective.	大选结束后三个星期，政府表示对美国选举基础架构的整体完整性依然充满信心，从网络安全的角度看，选举是自由和公平的。
But intelligence officials continued to investigate the impact of a broader Russian information-warfare campaign, in which fake stories about Clinton appeared intended to influence voters.	但美国情报官员依然在调查更宏观的俄罗斯信息战的影响，其中关于希拉里的虚假报道似乎试图左右选民。
Many of the false reports originated from RT News and Sputnik, two state-funded Russian outlets.	同时许多假新闻都始发于今日俄罗斯（RT News）和俄罗斯卫星网（Sputnik）这两家受政府资助的俄罗斯媒体。
Should this be treated as traditional propaganda or something new?	那么这应该被视为传统宣传战还是某些新生事物？
A number of critics believe that the level of official Russian state involvement in the 2016 US election process crossed a line and should not be dismissed as a form of tolerable gray-area behavior.	一些评论家认为，俄罗斯官方对2016年美国大选进程的介入程度相当过分，不应被视为一种可容忍的灰色地带行为。
These critics have urged the Obama administration to go further in naming and shaming, by providing a fuller public description of what US intelligence knows about Russia’s behavior, and by imposing financial and travel sanctions against high-level Russian officials who are identified.	这些批评者敦促奥巴马政府进一步指明始作俑者，更充分地公开披露美国情报部门掌握的俄罗斯行动情况，并对确认涉事的高级俄罗斯官员实施财务和旅行制裁。
Other US officials, however, are reluctant to jeopardize the intelligence means used for attribution, and are wary of escalation.	然而其他美国官员却不愿意披露用于收集这些情况的情报手段，并担心冲突升级。
Russia’s involvement in the 2016 US election was a watershed.	俄罗斯对2016年美国大选的介入是一个分水岭。
With important elections coming in a number of Western democracies, analysts will be watching closely to see what lessons the Kremlin draws from it.	鉴于一些西方民主国家也即将举行重要选举，分析人士将密切关注克里姆林宫会从中吸取什么样的经验教训。
	
Kremlin Musical Chairs	克里姆林宫的换椅子游戏
It’s that time again – Russia’s pre-election season when prime ministers are changed as in a game of musical chairs.	在俄罗斯又一次面临大选的时候，总理宝座像换椅子游戏那样不断地变换着人选。
The last one seated, it is supposed, will become Russia’s next president.	而最后一个坐上这个位置的人被认为会成为俄罗斯的下一任总统。
As the end of his rule approached, Boris Yeltsin went through at least a half-dozen prime ministers, looking for the one who would ensure the security not only of Russia’s new democracy and market economy, but also of his “family” and the wealth that it had accumulated during his rule.	在任期行将结束前，叶利钦换了至少六个总理，以寻找到一个不但能保证俄罗斯的新民主和市场经济的安全，同时更能保证他的“家族”以及在他的执政期间累积起来的巨大财富的安全的人选。
The last man seated then was, of course, Vladimir Putin.	当然，最后一个坐上这个位置的人就是普京。
Now it is Putin’s turn to call the tune, dismissing Mikhail Fradkov and dissolving the government that had served him throughout his second term in order to prepare for the parliamentary elections looming in December and the presidential ballot in March 2008.	现在轮到普京来做这场游戏了，将一直在他的第二任期内担任总理的弗拉德科夫解职以及解散政府正是在为将于11月份进行的议会选举和2008年3月份进行的总统选举做准备。
In 1999, Yeltsin picked Putin, who was then the little-known head of the FSB (formerly the KGB).	1999年的时候，叶利钦挑选了当时不太为人所知的联邦安全局（前克格勃）的局长普京。
Putin chose to elevate the equally mysterious Victor Zubkov, head of the Federal Financial Monitoring Service (also known as the “finance espionage” agency).	而现在普京选择提拔同样神秘的祖布科夫，联邦金融监测局（也被称为“金融间谍”机构）局长。
Despite that similarity, the reasoning behind these choices appears to be somewhat different.	尽管有这种相似性，在这些选择背后的原因却似乎有所不同。
Yeltsin’s choice of Putin – encouraged, ironically, by Boris Berezovsky, the prominent Russian oligarch and Yeltsin advisor who is now exiled in London as Putin’s mortal enemy – was based on his belief that the quiet apparatchik, even if a former KGB spy, was a democrat at heart.	具有讽刺意味的是，叶利钦选择普京是受到别列佐夫斯基的鼓动，他是俄罗斯寡头统治集团的重要成员以及叶利钦的顾问，现在流亡在伦敦，成了普京不共戴天的敌人。 叶利钦是因为他相信这一寡言少语的党政官员，即便是一个前克格勃的间谍，在本质上也是一个民主主义者。
After all, Putin had been a protegé of Anatoly Sobchak, the liberal mayor of St. Petersburg as communism collapsed.	不管怎样，普京曾是索布恰克，这一在共产主义倒台后担任彼得堡市市长的自由主义者的门徒。
A security services insider, Putin was seen as well placed to protect Yeltsin and his oligarchic allies.	作为一个在安全部门局内人，挑选普京还被认为可以保护叶利钦和他的寡头统治集团成员。
Indeed, Berezovsky intended to continue ruling the country from behind the scenes, first as Yeltsin’s health failed in the final months of his presidency, and then by controlling the successor he had helped to choose.	事实上，别列佐夫斯基希望能够继续在幕后操纵这个国家，开始在叶利钦总统任期的最后几个月当他健康情况恶化的时候，然后可以通过控制他帮助挑选的继任者来达到这一目的。
In Russia, however, the KGB is famous for turning the tables in any struggle with the Kremlin apparat.	然而，在俄罗斯，克格勃一向以其在与克里姆林宫的任何斗争最终总能转败为胜而著称。
So no one but Yeltsin and Berezovsky was surprised when Putin, their supposed marionette, began pulling the strings.	所以当普京这个他们想象中的提线木偶人开始操纵局势时，大概除了叶利钦和别列佐夫斯基之外没有人会感到惊讶。
And pull them he did, turning Berezovsky into an international villain, exiling former media mogul Vladimir Gusinsky, jailing the oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and eventually imposing a new authoritarian regime behind the façade of Yeltsin’s democratic institutions.	在他的操纵下，别列佐夫斯基被化身成了一个国际上的恶棍，前传媒巨头古辛斯基流亡国外，石油寡头霍多尔科夫斯基被送进了监狱，最后是在叶利钦建立起来的民主机构的外表下建立起了一个新的专制政权。
Putin’s own game of prime ministerial “musical chairs” does not reflect a desire to secure for himself a quiet position behind the scenes while someone else rules, for he knows all too well that the path from the Kremlin leads only to inner exile and the grave.	普京自己所玩的这个总理宝座的“换椅子游戏”并不是想要在别人当政的时候自己能够悄悄地躲在幕后，因为他非常清楚从克里姆林宫出来后的路只会通向在国内流放以及墓地。
Stalin replaced the dying Lenin, Khrushchev denounced Stalin, Brezhnev banished Khrushchev to his dacha, and Gorbachev buried Chernenko.	斯大林替代了行将死亡的列宁，赫鲁晓夫公然抨击了斯大林，勃列日涅夫将赫鲁晓夫流放到他的乡间别墅，而戈尔巴乔夫埋葬了契尔年科。
Only Yeltsin did things differently.	只有叶利钦的做法有所不同。
He disliked his predecessor, Mikhail Gorbachev, as much his predecessors disliked their predecessors.	他讨厌他的前任戈尔巴乔夫一如他的前任者不喜欢他们各自的前任者一样。
But all the same he treated Gorbachev in a more decent manner because Yeltsin fundamentally believed in democracy.	然后他还是以一种更加体面的方式对待戈尔巴乔夫，因为叶利钦在本质上相信民主。
So he left Gorbachev a private life that could also be lived in public.	所以他允许戈尔巴乔夫过他自己私人的生活，并且还可以出现在公众中。
Putin, of course, did not accost the retired Yeltsin, but he didn’t have to.	当然，普京并没有与退休的叶利钦搭话，但是他并不必要这样做。
He simply ignored him while reversing his achievements in building a free Russia.	他只是把他晾在一边，而在叶利钦建立自由俄罗斯的成就上开倒车。
Before Zubkov’s nomination, reports swirled that the next prime minister would become Putin’s presidential successor, with Sergei Ivanov, a current deputy prime minister, dubbed the most likely candidate.	在祖布科夫被提名前，媒体纷纷流传下一任总理会成为普京的总统继承人，而现任副总理伊万诺夫是最有可能的候选人。
But Ivanov, who is perceived as “strong,” would provide unwelcome competition to Putin, who, after all, remains a “strong” president.	但是伊万诺夫被认为很“强势”的人，会给普京带来令人不快的竞争，因为后者不管怎样依然是一位“强势”的总统。
Had he anointed Ivanov now, Putin’s power would already begin seeping away.	如果他现在就提名伊万诺夫，那么普京的权力现在就会开始被慢慢地蚕食。
The outgoing Fradkov, surprisingly, put the matter best when he explained why he had resigned: with elections approaching, Putin needed a free hand.	走下总理宝座的弗拉德科夫在解释他为什么辞职时令人惊讶地最恰如其分地解释了事情的原由。 也就是，随着大选的临近，普京需要完全自由地做出各种决定。
So Zubkov’s nomination allows Putin to continue to keep his cards – and thus ultimate power in Russia – close to his chest.	所以提名祖布科夫可以让普京继续对他的计划秘而不���，同时也可以维持他在俄罗斯的最高权力。
Of course, Zubkov will continue Fradkov’s “Yes, whatever you say Mr. President” management style.	当然，祖布科夫会继续弗拉德科夫的管理方式 ， “ 是的，总统先生，一切都按你的意思办 ” 。
Moreover, his former position as head of the Federal Financial Monitoring Service will allow him to draw on a wealth of information to keep tabs on all possible enemies and competitors, perhaps turning them into new model Berezovsky’s, Gusinsky’s and Khodorkovsky’s, if necessary.	此外，他曾担任过联邦金融监测局局长的经历，也使他掌握了对所有可能的敌人和竞争对手进行监视的丰富信息，如果需要的话，也许会把他们变成新的别列佐夫斯基、古辛斯基和霍多尔科夫斯基。
The only question now is whether Zubkov, or his successor, will eventually succeed in turning Czar Vladimir into the same sort of non-person that Putin’s rivals have become.	现在唯一的问题就是祖布科夫或者他的继任者是否会最终成功地把弗拉基米尔沙皇也变成像普京的对手已经变成的同样的那种“非人 ” 。
	
Paul Krugman and the Obama Recovery	保罗·克鲁格曼和奥巴马复苏
NEW YORK – For several years, and often several times a month, the Nobel laureate economist and New York Times columnist and blogger Paul Krugman has delivered one main message to his loyal readers: deficit-cutting “austerians” (as he calls advocates of fiscal austerity) are deluded.	纽约—几年以来，常常每个月都有几次，诺贝尔经济学奖获得者 、 《 纽约时报》专栏作家兼博客写手保罗·克鲁格曼（Paul Krugman）都会向他的忠实读者发布一条重要信息：削减赤字的“紧缩派 ” （ 他对支持财政紧缩者的称呼）被骗了。
Fiscal retrenchment amid weak private demand would lead to chronically high unemployment.	事实上，赤字削减将让1937年重现。
Indeed, deficit cuts would court a reprise of 1937, when Franklin D. Roosevelt prematurely reduced the New Deal stimulus and thereby threw the United States back into recession.	当时，富兰克林·罗斯福过早地缩减新政刺激，导致美国再次滑入衰退。
Well, Congress and the White House did indeed play the austerian card from mid-2011 onward.	好吧，自2011年年中以来，国会和白宫确实实施了紧缩。
The federal budget deficit has declined from 8.4% of GDP in 2011 to a predicted 2.9% of GDP for all of 2014.	联邦预算赤字占GDP之比从2011年的8.4%下降到2014年的2.9 % （ 预计值 ） 。
And, according to the International Monetary Fund, the structural deficit (sometimes called the “full-employment deficit”), a measure of fiscal stimulus, has fallen from 7.8% of potential GDP to 4% of potential GDP from 2011 to 2014.	此外，根据国际货币基金组织（IMF）的数据，衡量财政刺激的指标结构性赤字（有时称为“充分就业赤字 ” ） 从2011年占潜在GDP的7.8%下降到2014年的4 % 。
Krugman has vigorously protested that deficit reduction has prolonged and even intensified what he repeatedly calls a “depression” (or sometimes a “low-grade depression”).	克鲁格曼强烈反对削减赤字延长甚至加剧了他反复所谓的“萧条 ” （ 有时也称为“低度萧条 ” ） 的观点。
Only fools like the United Kingdom’s leaders (who reminded him of the Three Stooges) could believe otherwise.	只有英国领导人这样的蠢货（让他想起了“三傻 ” （ Three Stooges ） ） 才会相信这样的观点。
Yet, rather than a new recession, or an ongoing depression, the US unemployment rate has fallen from 8.6% in November 2011 to 5.8% in November 2014.	但是，美国并没有迎来新衰退，也没有继续萧条，失业率从2011年11月的8.6%下降至2014年11月的5.8 % 。
Real economic growth in 2011 stood at 1.6%, and the IMF expects it to be 2.2% for 2014 as a whole.	2011年真实经济增长只有1.6 % ， 而IMF预计2014年全年可达2.2 % 。
GDP in the third quarter of 2014 grew at a vigorous 5% annual rate, suggesting that aggregate growth for all of 2015 will be above 3%.	2014年三季度GDP增长年率达到了强劲的5 % ， 这意味着2015年全年总增长将高于3 % 。
So much for Krugman’s predictions.	克鲁格曼的预测就是如此。
Not one of his New York Times commentaries in the first half of 2013, when “austerian” deficit cutting was taking effect, forecast a major reduction in unemployment or that economic growth would recover to brisk rates.	他在2013年上半年的所有《纽约时报》评论中 — — 当时“紧缩派”赤字削减措施正在开始见效 — — 都没有预见到失业的大幅下降，也没有预见到经济增长能恢复活力。
On the contrary, “the disastrous turn toward austerity has destroyed millions of jobs and ruined many lives,” he argued, with the US Congress exposing Americans to “the imminent threat of severe economic damage from short-term spending cuts.”	相反 ， “ 可怕的转向紧缩摧毁了数百万个就业岗位，也破坏了无数人的生活 ， ” 他说，而美国国会让美国人暴露在“来自短期支出削减的严重经济伤害的巨大威胁之下 ” 。
As a result, “Full recovery still looks a very long way off,” he warned. “And I’m beginning to worry that it may never happen.”	因此 ， “ 充分复苏仍然十分遥远 ， ” 他警告说 ， “ 我甚至担心它到底能不能实现��”
I raise all of this because Krugman took a victory lap in his end-of-2014 column on “The Obama Recovery.”	我罗列这些是因为克鲁格曼在他的2014年年底专栏《奥巴马复苏 》 （ The Obama Recovery）中俨然一副胜利者的姿态。
The recovery, according to Krugman, has come not despite the austerity he railed against for years, but because we “seem to have stopped tightening the screws: Public spending isn’t surging, but at least it has stopped falling.	按他的说法，复苏并不是来自他多年来一直反对的紧缩，而是因为我们“似乎已经停止拧紧螺丝：公共支出没有大幅增加，但至少也不再下降。
And the economy is doing much better as a result.”	经济也因此大有起色 。 ”
That is an incredible claim.	这真是令人难以置信的观点。
The budget deficit has been brought down sharply, and unemployment has declined.	预算赤字大幅减少，失业也有所下降。
Yet Krugman now says that everything has turned out just as he predicted.	但现在克鲁格曼却说所有事情都和他预料的完全一样。
In fact, Krugman has been conflating two distinct ideas as if both were components of “progressive” thinking.	事实上，克鲁格曼聚合了两种不同观点，让它们看起来都像是“进步”思维的要素。
On one hand, he has been the “conscience of a liberal,” rightly focusing on how government can combat poverty, poor health, environmental degradation, rising inequality, and other social ills.	一方面，他是“自由派的良心 ” ， 正确地将注意力集中在政府如何减少贫困、解决穷人的医疗问题、阻止环境破坏、遏制不平等性加剧和治理其他社会问题上。
I admire that side of Krugman’s writing, and, as I wrote in my book The Price of Civilization, I agree with him.	我仰慕克鲁格曼在这方面的工作，并且如我在《文明的代价 》 （ The Price of Civilization）一书中所言，我同意他的观点。
On the other hand, Krugman has inexplicably taken up the mantle of crude aggregate-demand management, making it seem that favoring large budget deficits in recent years is also part of progressive economics.	另一方面，克鲁格曼令人费解地举起了粗犷总需求管理的大旗，将近几年对大规模预算赤字的支持也说成是进步经济学的一部分。
(Krugman’s position is sometimes called Keynesianism, but John Maynard Keynes knew much better than Krugman that we should not depend on mechanistic “demand multipliers” to set the unemployment rate.)	（克鲁格曼的立场有时被称为凯恩斯主义，但凯恩斯远比克鲁格曼清楚，我们不应该依赖机械的“需求乘数”来决定失业率。
Deficits were not increased enough in 2009 to escape from high unemployment, he insisted, and were falling dangerously fast after 2010.	）他坚持认为，2009年赤字增加的不够，因此无法降低高失业；而2010年以降，赤字更是出现了危险的快速减少之势。
Obviously, recent trends – a significant decline in the unemployment rate and a reasonably high and accelerating rate of economic growth – cast doubt on Krugman’s macroeconomic diagnosis (though not on his progressive politics).	显然，近期趋势 — — 失业率的大幅下降以及相当漂亮并且还在加速的经济增长 — — 让克鲁格曼的宏观经济诊断令人质疑（但他的进步政治学除外 ） 。
And the same trends have been apparent in the United Kingdom, where Prime Minister David Cameron’s government has cut the structural budget deficit from 8.4% of potential GDP in 2010 to 4.1% in 2014, while the unemployment rate has fallen from 7.9% when Cameron took office to 6%, according to the most recent data for the fall of 2014.	而相同的趋势在英国也显而易见，首相卡梅伦政府将结构性预算赤字从2010年占潜在GDP的8.4%下降至2014年的4.1 % ， 而失业率则从卡梅伦执政初期的7.9%下降至6 % （ 2014年秋季最新数据 ） 。
To be clear, I believe that we do need more government spending as a share of GDP – for education, infrastructure, low-carbon energy, research and development, and family benefits for low-income families.	坦白说，我认为我们确实需要提高政府支出占GDP的比例 — — 将钱花在教育、基础设施、低碳能源、研发活动和低收入家庭福利上。
But we should pay for this through higher taxes on high incomes and high net worth, a carbon tax, and future tolls collected on new infrastructure.	但我们应该通过增加高收入和高净财富者的税率、提高碳税和提高新基础设施的未来费用来筹集资金。
We need the liberal conscience, but without the chronic budget deficits.	我们需要自由派的良心，但不要顽固的预算赤字。
There is nothing progressive about large budget deficits and a rising debt-to-GDP ratio.	巨大的预算赤字和不断上升的债务-GDP比率绝不具有进步性质。
After all, large deficits have no reliable effect on reducing unemployment, and deficit reduction can be consistent with falling unemployment.	毕竟，巨额赤字对于降低失业并没有可靠影响，而赤字削减倒是与失业下降一致。
Krugman is a great economic theorist – and a great polemicist.	克鲁格曼是伟大的经济理论家 — — 也是伟大的辩论家。
But he should replace his polemical hat with his analytical one and reflect more deeply on recent experience: deficit-cutting accompanied by recovery, job creation, and lower unemployment.	但他应该甩掉辩论家的帽子，树立分析家的招牌，深刻思考最新的经验：赤字削减与复苏、就业创造和失业下降同时出现。
This should be an occasion for him to rethink his long-standing macroeconomic mantra, rather than claiming vindication for ideas that recent trends seem to contradict.	这应该成为一次让他反思其长期坚持的宏观经济咒语的机会，而不是为已被最新趋势证明存在矛盾的观点辩护。
	
Krugman’s Anti-Cameron Contradiction	克鲁格曼的反卡梅伦矛盾
NEW YORK – It is truly odd to read Paul Krugman rail, time and again, against the British government.	纽约—保罗·克鲁格曼（Paul Krugman）反复抨击英国政府，这着实令人奇怪。
His latest screed begins with the claim that “Britain’s economic performance since the financial crisis struck has been startlingly bad.”	他最近的长文在一开始就指出“自金融危机以来，英国经济表现令人难以置信地糟糕 。 ”
He excoriates Prime Minister David Cameron’s government for its “poor economic record,” and wonders how he and his cabinet can possibly pose “as the guardians of prosperity.”	他批评首相卡梅伦政府需要为“糟糕的经济记录”负责，并质疑卡梅伦及其内阁是否能够担当“繁荣卫士 ” 。
Hmm.	恩。
In recent months, Krugman has repeatedly praised the US economic recovery under President Barack Obama, while attacking the United Kingdom’s record.	最近几个月来，克鲁格曼一再赞扬美国经济在总统奥巴马治下的复苏势头，而攻击英国的经济表现。
But when we compare the two economies side by side, their trajectories are broadly similar, with the UK outperforming the United States on certain indicators.	但我们背靠背比较这两大经济体就可以发现，它们的运行轨迹大体相当，英国在一些指标上表现还强于美国。
Consider, first, the unemployment rate.	首先来看失业率。
In the fourth quarter of 2007, the UK’s rate was 5.2%.	2007年四季度，英国失业率为5.2 % 。
When Cameron’s government took office in May 2010, it was 7.9%.	卡梅伦政府2010年5月上台时，失业率是7.9 % 。
In the most recent reporting period (November 2014-January 2015), it was 5.7%.	而在最近的报告期（2014年11月—2015年1月 ） ， 失业率是5.7 % 。
In the US, the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2007 was 4.8%, 9.8% in March-May 2010, and 5.7% in November 2014-January 2015.	在美国，2007年四季度失业率为4.8 % ， 2010年3—5月为9.8 % ， 2014年11月—2015年1月为5.7 % 。
In both countries, the unemployment rate is therefore slightly above the pre-crisis (end-2007) level, with no significant net difference over the business cycle from the end of 2007 until now.	因此，两个国家的失业率均略高于危机前（2007年底）水平，在2007年底至今的商业周期中没有出现较大净差异。
Next, let’s look at the employment rate, which in the UK stood at 72.9% of the population aged 16-64 at the end of 2007.	然后我们来看看就业率。 2007年，英国16—24岁年龄段人口就业率为72.9 % 。
It fell to 70.4% by the time the Cameron government came to power, but since then has risen strongly, to 73.3% in November 2014-January 2015, an all-time high.	卡梅伦政府开始执政时这一就业率下跌至70.4 % ， 此后强劲反弹，2014年11月—2015年1月达到了历史最高水平73.3 % 。
In the US, by contrast, the employment rate was 62.8% at the end of 2007, 58.6% in March-May 2010, and then only slightly higher, at 59.2%, during November 2014-January 2015 – still below the pre-crisis level.	相反，在美国，2007年底这一就业率为62.8 % ， 2010年3—5月为58.6 % ， 然后略有上升，2014年11月—2015年1月为59.2 % — —仍低于危机前水平。
This suggests that there are more discouraged workers in the US than in the UK.	这表明美国的失望工人比英国更多。
Finally, there is output growth.	最后来看看产出增长。
In the UK, real (inflation-adjusted) GDP fell by 3.8% from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the second quarter of 2010.	在英国，真实（经通胀调整的）GDP在2007年四季度至2010年二季度间下降了3.8 % 。
It then rose by 8.1% from that point until the fourth quarter of 2014.	此后直至2014年四季度上升了8.1 % 。
In the US, real GDP fell by 1.6% from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the second quarter of 2010, and then rose by 10.5% from then until the fourth quarter of 2014.	在美国，2007年四季度到2010年二季度真实GDP下降1.6 % ， 此后直至2014年四季度增加10.5 % 。
Thus, both countries have experienced moderately high and broadly similar growth rates since May 2010, when Cameron’s government took power.	因此，2010年5月卡梅伦政府开始执政以来，两国的增长率都比较高且大致相当。
Yes, UK growth has been slightly slower, but the British economy has also faced, among other factors, the headwind of sharply falling North Sea oil production during this period, whereas the US benefited from a shale-oil boom.	诚然，英国增长率要略低一些，但在此期间英国经济面临着北海石油产量急剧下滑等不利因素，而美国则得益于页岩油繁荣。
Obviously, neither of these long-term trends can be fairly attributed to the governments currently in office.	显然，这些长期趋势都不能完全归因于现任政府。
In any case, during the past two years, from the fourth quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2014, the US economy grew by a cumulative 5.6% while the UK economy grew by 5.4%, essentially the same as the US.	无论如何，从2012年四季度到2014年四季度的两年中，美国经济累计增长5.6 % ， 而英国增长5.4 % ， 与美国旗鼓相当。
Krugman seems to make much of the fact that the UK did not bounce back even more strongly from a larger output decline between the fourth quarter of 2007 and the fourth quarter of 2010 – a fall that occurred before the Cameron government took office.	克鲁格曼大做文章的一个事实是英国没有从2007年四季度到2010年四季度之间更大规模的产出下降的基础上实现更强劲的反弹 — — 这一产出下降发生在卡梅伦政府上台之前。
That is true, and measured UK productivity growth has remained low, but nobody can be sure why.	诚然，并且英国测得生产率增长也仍然很低，但没人知道确切原因。
Perhaps the unsustainable pre-2008 bubble was larger in the UK; perhaps the UK’s structure (particularly the larger share of finance in its GDP and the continued decline in energy output) made the initial downturn less reversible.	也许2008年前的不可持续的泡沫在英国规模更大一些；也许英国的结构（特别是金融占GDP比重更大以及能源产出持续下降）使其最初的衰退更加难以扭转。
The UK has been more vulnerable than the US to the eurozone’s prolonged crisis.	英国比美国更容易受到漫长的欧元区危机的影响。
Moreover, subtle differences between the US and UK in national income accounting should be taken into account in comparing productivity trends.	此外，美国和英国在国民收入记录方法上的微妙差异也应该在比较生产率趋势时有所考虑。
The International Monetary Fund’s estimate of the output gap (see its World Economic Outlook database) for both countries does not suggest that, as of 2014, the UK is more cyclically depressed than the US.	国际货币基金组织（IMF）对两国的产出缺口（见IMF世界经济展望数据库）估计并不表明（如2014年）英国的周期性萧条比美国严重。
Indeed, in the IMF’s estimates at least, the opposite is the case.	事实上，至少在IMF的估计中，情况正好相反。
The IMF puts the UK output gap (as a percent of potential GDP) at 1.2%, compared to 3.5% in the US.	IMF认为英国产出缺口（占潜在GDP的百分比）为1.2 % ， 而美国为3.5 % 。
Of course, both estimates are subject to questions of interpretation; the IMF assumes, for example, that the UK was operating well above potential GDP in 2006-8.	当然，这两个估计值都要受到解释问题的影响；比如IMF假设英国在2006—2008年期间以远高于潜在GDP的水平运行。
The fact is that the US and UK economies look rather alike in their overall cyclical patterns, with sharp downturns from 2007 to 2010 followed by recoveries in both jobs and GDP since then, and with a fairly rapid pace of recovery in the past two years.	事实上，美国和英国经济的总体周期模式十分相似，2007年至2010年大幅衰退，接着就业和GDP都有所复苏，并且过去两年复苏速度相当快。
So, if Krugman praises the Obama recovery, he should also praise the Cameron recovery.	因此，如果克鲁格曼对奥巴马复苏大加赞赏，那么他同样应该赞赏卡梅伦复苏。
They are very similar.	它们差不多。
Perhaps more notable is that both the US and UK economies have cast considerable doubt on Krugman’s oft-repeated view that a robust recovery would require further fiscal stimulus, a position that he maintained at least until 2013.	也许更加引人关注的是美国和英国经济严重质疑了克鲁格曼时常挂在嘴边的观点 — — 强健复苏需要更多财政刺激。 至少在2013年之前，他一直持有这一立场。
The post-2010 recoveries in both countries came despite significant cuts in the structural (cyclically adjusted) budget deficit, suggesting that both recoveries occurred in the face of fiscal contraction.	2010年后的英国和美国复苏是在结构性（经周期调整的）预算赤字大幅削减的情况下实现的，这表明两国的复苏都发生于财政收缩环境中。
According to the IMF estimates, the structural budget deficit was cut from 8.4% of potential GDP in 2010 to 4.1% in 2014 in the UK, and from 9.1% to 4% in the US during the same period.	据IMF估计，英国结构性预算赤字从2010年占潜在GDP的8.4%削减至2014年的4.1 % ， 而美国同期从9.1%削减至4 % 。
Rather than lambasting Cameron while lauding Obama, Krugman should be praising both countries for their recoveries.	克鲁格曼不应该抨击卡梅伦而赞扬奥巴马，而应该赞美两国的复苏。
The truth is that – barring another Greek tragedy – both the UK and US are finally out of the post-2008 crisis.	真相是英国和美国阻止了又一场希腊悲剧，最终走出了2008年后危机。
It is time for both countries to move beyond short-term macroeconomic policy and turn their attention to the challenges of long-term sustainable development.	两国应该超越短期宏观经济政策，将注意力转向长期可持续发展挑战。
	
The Case for Kurdistan	库尔德斯坦建国
TEL AVIV – The Kurds – who occupy a mountainous region that includes portions of Armenia, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Turkey – are the largest ethnic group in the world without a state to call their own.	特拉维夫 — — 占据包括亚美尼亚、伊朗、伊拉克、叙利亚和土耳其等国山区的库尔德人是当今世界规模最大的未能建立自己国家的民族。
It is time to change that.	现在改变的时机已经成熟。
The Kurds have been making bids for statehood – and having them brutally suppressed – since the early twentieth century.	20世纪初以来库尔德人一直在努力争取国家地位 — — 并因此招致被残酷镇压的命运。
But there is a strong case for the United States, in particular, to work toward securing a homeland for the Kurds – a case buttressed by Kurdish militias’ indispensable contribution to defeating the Islamic State.	但美国尤其有理由协助库尔德人建国 — — 因为库尔德民兵在打败伊斯兰国的过程中作出了不可或缺的贡献。
To be sure, the establishment of a “greater Kurdistan” that includes all areas where the Kurds comprise a majority remains impossible.	可以肯定，建立包括以库尔德人为主的所有地区的“大库尔德斯坦”仍然不可能。
If internal Kurdish politics were not enough to prevent such an outcome, geostrategic constraints certainly would be.	如果库尔德内部政治不足以防止出现这样的结果，地缘政治方面的限制也不能允许这样的结果发生。
Kurdish independence is particularly implausible in Turkey.	库尔德人独立在土耳其尤其令人难以置信。
The Kurds’ main representative in that country, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) – which champions a distinctly secular, Marxist brand of nationalism – has been fighting the Turkish government for decades.	库尔德人在该国的主要代表库尔德工人党（PKK）明确信仰世俗、马克思式的民族主义，数十年来一直在与土耳其政府进行斗争。
But, the government, led by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has not wavered in its commitment to preventing the establishment of a Kurdish state, to the point that even the PKK’s founder, Abdullah Öcalan, now favors a resolution that falls short of independence.	但雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安总统领导下的政府从未动摇其阻止库尔德人建国的决心，甚至就连库尔德工人党的创立者阿卜杜拉·奥卡兰现在也没有对独立方案表示赞成。
Erdoğan’s commitment to ending the PKK’s quest is so strong that he is also working to prevent Syria’s Kurds from leveraging sovereignty from their military gains against ISIS.	埃尔多安终结库尔德工人党目标的决心如此强大，他也在竭力阻止叙利亚库尔德人从针对伊斯兰国的军事胜利中捞取筹码建国。
He fears that Kurdish success in Syria would inspire Turkey’s Kurds to revive their own fight for statehood in the country’s southeast.	他担心库尔德人在叙利亚所取得的成功将激励土耳其库尔德人在土耳其东南部地区恢复以建国为目标的斗争。
This fear of nationalist spillover has driven Erdoğan’s campaign to create a buffer zone along the Turkish border that extends well into the territory now controlled by Syrian Kurds.	这种对民族主义溢出效应的担忧已经促使埃尔多安政府沿土耳其边境设立缓冲区，该缓冲区甚至包括现在由叙利亚库尔德人控制的大片领土。
But the Kurdish community in Iraq, represented by the Kurdish Regional Government, has a real shot at statehood.	但由库尔德地区政府所代表的伊拉克库尔德群体真正有机会实现建国。
The KRG is a quasi-sovereign entity overseeing an efficient military and an independent economy.	库尔德地区政府是一个准主权机构，管辖着高效率的军队和独立的经济活动。
Although it is plagued by corruption and cronyism, like every other political organization in the region, the KRG represents the only truly functional government in Iraq, presiding over the country’s most peaceful and stable areas.	尽管腐败和裙带关系像困扰地区其他政治机构那样困扰着库尔德地区政府，但该政府代表着伊拉克唯一一个能够真正行使职能的政府，统治着该国最和平、最稳定的地区。
The strength of the KRG’s position is not lost on its leaders.	库尔德地区政府的力量并未在其领导人身上丧失。
The ruling Kurdish Democratic Party plans to hold a referendum on independence this September.	执政的库尔德民主党计划在今年9月举行独立公投。
Yet even a resounding call for secession will not be enough to achieve success.	但即便分裂的呼声再响也不足以取得成功。
For that, the US must throw its weight behind the pro-Western KRG and offer resolute support for the independence effort.	为了确保库尔德人成功建国，美国必须全力支持亲西方的库尔德地区政府，并为库尔德人的独立事业提供坚定的支持。
After 14 years of failed military intervention in Iraq, the US should recognize that “a unified, stable, democratic, and federal Iraq,” as a State Department spokesperson recently put it, is a chimera.	在长达14年的军事干预伊拉克失败后，美国应当承认像国务院发言人不久前所说的“建立一个团结、稳定、民主和联合的伊拉克”仅仅是一个美梦。
Since the US-led invasion in 2003, Iraq’s political system has become highly polarized along sectarian lines, with the ruling Shia majority marginalizing the Sunnis, including the Kurds.	自从2003年美国领导入侵伊拉克以来，伊拉克的政治制度已经沿宗派界限高度两极化，导致执政的什叶派多数族裔边缘化逊尼派人口，其中也包括库尔德人。
Indeed, Sunni exclusion was a key reason for the rise of ISIS.	事实上，排斥逊尼派是伊斯兰国崛起的一个关键因素。
Today, Iraq is effectively an Iranian trusteeship, not a US ally.	今天，伊拉克已经实质上成为伊朗的托管国，而不是美国的盟友。
To the dismay of the Kurds and other Sunni Iraqis, Shia militias controlled by the Iraqi and Iranian governments, such as Hashd al-Shaabi, are filling much of the void left behind by ISIS.	令库尔德人和其他逊尼派伊拉克人沮丧的是，由伊拉克和伊朗政府所控制的哈沙德·沙比等什叶派民兵正在填补由伊斯兰国留下的绝大部分真空。
As the experience in Yugoslavia showed, when ethnic or religious cleavages explode, the most effective path to peace may well be separation.	南斯拉夫的经验表明，当种族或宗教分裂势力爆发时，分裂很可能是通往和平最有效的途径。
And a Kurdish state has a real chance of thriving: an independent Kurdistan could manage to combine natural-resource wealth with a tradition of stable and pragmatic governance, thereby creating a sustainable democracy.	而且库尔德国家拥有真正的机会实现繁荣：一个独立的库尔德斯坦可以将自然资源财富与稳定务实的治理传统相结合，从而创造出可以持续的民主。
This would amount to a win for pro-Western forces in the Middle East.	这相当于亲西方势力在中东地区获胜。
Even Turkey may be willing to accept such an outcome.	即便土耳其或许也愿意接受这样的结果。
The US and Turkish governments agree on distinguishing the Kurds in Iraq from those in Turkey, for whom statehood is not an option.	美国和土耳其政府同意区别对待伊拉克和土耳其境内的库尔德人，对土耳其境内的库尔德人来说，独立建国不是一种选择。
In fact, Turkey has strong relations with the KRG – bilateral trade has lately been expanding, and KRG oil pipelines extend into Turkish territory – because Erdoğan’s government views it as a counterweight to Turkey’s PKK.	事实上，土耳其一直与库尔德地区政府关系密切 — — 双边贸易规模近年来不断扩大，而库尔德地区政府的输油管道则向土耳其控制地区延伸 — — 因为埃尔多安政府将其视作对土耳其库尔德工人党势力的平衡。
Moreover, now that President Donald Trump, by ending US military support for Syria’s anti-government rebels, has effectively handed the country over to Russia and Iran, Sunni-led Turkey needs a strategic buffer against Shia-led Iraq and Syria more than ever.	不仅如此，现在唐纳德·特朗普总统通过结束美国对叙利亚反政府叛乱武装的支持，已经在实际上将该国拱手让给了伊朗和俄罗斯，因此逊尼派领导的土耳其比以往任何时候都更需要针对什叶派领导的伊拉克和叙利亚的战略缓冲区。
